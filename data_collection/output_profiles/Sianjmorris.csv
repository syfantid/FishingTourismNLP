"Fantastic, wonderful and amazing day out.","Samos fishing trips is a fantastic way to spend a day of your holiday on Samos. I Would highly recommend it to everyone of all ages. From the minute you step on board the superb experience begins........ The hosts are very welcoming and professional; this is also an opportunity to learn a new skill and more about Samos sea life. The delicious lunch, local wine, glorious scenery and views and the occasional sighting of dolphins all add to this amazing day out. Diolch yn fawr (thank you very much) we will see you next year.

Great food and good hospitality,"I have visited Lakis restaurant twice and on both occasions have had excellent food and an enjoyable experience. The menu is typically Greek but gives diners plenty of choice catering for all tastes, ages and preferences including a strict vegetarian.

The owner Lakis and his staff are attentive and happy to accommodate requests from customers. We will definitely return soon.",Date of visit: May 2017,Lakis Restaurant,4,"Samos, Greece"
A lunch to remember,We are frequent visitors to Samos and occasional visitors to this small but perfectly located restaurant. Today we had the most unusual and delicious Greek salad with over 20 different ingredients followed by shrimp saganaki in ouzo sauce. Excellent service will definitely recommend and return.,Date of visit: May 2017,Triantafillos,4,"Samos, Greece"
"Excellent location, friendly efficient service and good value","A group of four of us booked two rooms on the third floor for 4 nights on 12th November. Check in was straightforward but we were given two rooms with double beds however the next day we changed one to a twin room without any problem. Throughout our stay we had reason to make a number of requests from the staff and they were always very helpful and happy to assist us. We enjoyed the fact there was a sports bar and music bar to spend some time in, residents get a 10% discount, happy hour is good value and the menu is more than adequate with generous portions. We really enjoyed the resident band in the music bar.

The location of the hotel is excellent just a few minutes from the Emirates mall and close to the hop on hop off bus station. Easy to get a taxi from outside the hotel.

If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel that provides clean comfortable accommodation with good facilities in a central location this one is ideal.",Date of stay: November 2015,Citymax Hotel Al Barsha at the Mall,4,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
Ideal place to stay,"We have stayed in the Samos Sun a number of times and have always enjoyed our stay. The hotel is very well located and offers excellent facilities. The rooms are slightly larger than average for this area and the cost includes air con and a fridge. The pool is large and well maintained. Other benefits are the supermarket next door, car hire close by and the Evelin pool bar just across the road. The nearest beach is a 10 min walk and Pythagorio port about 20 mins. I would recommend this hotel as a good base for exploring Samos.",Date of stay: August 2014,Samos Sun Resort Hotel,4,"Samos, Greece"
