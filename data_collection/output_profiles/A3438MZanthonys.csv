awesome,"Ace place, great music both on playlist and live. The staff, really friendly too. Definitely worth a visit this place!",Date of experience: October 2020,"Boheme Bar, Tapas & Cafe",4,"Rhodes, Greece"
"Complex is decent, the facilities and bar staff not so decent!","We were quite pleased with the rooms and the complex as a whole, which was clean and bright. The sun loungers were a little crammed together, leaving not much room to move and also being ""on top"" of the people next to you but tolerable, never the less.

So, we paid all inc. This is where the fun starts. There are 2 bar areas. Both were open at the beginning of the holiday and the volumes of people wanting drinks were split. However, they closed one of the bars after our 1st day (0f 14) presumably because it was late int he season - that being September. The problem with this, is that is was hammered with people therefore, one bar with 2 or 3 staff on trying to cope with the volumes. We queued most days in excess of 15 mins.. you are only allowed 2 drinks (we were in a group of 4) So to get the girls a drink, we had to get ours, then queue up again for theirs. There was no give on 1 drink person, in your party. The staff were quite rude with this on multiple occasions and arguments were a feature throughout our stay, between the staff and various punters. If you were in the queue 15 mins before the bar turned premium but you happened to miss it by 1 second - you were charged premium prices. The only half decent thing about that, was the the very small plastic glasses they issued, changed into reasonable sized glass drinks - ones you'd expect anyway for the price paid. I think the staff were short staffed and under a lot of pressure, therefore i don't blame them directly for being rude. Still, not a great experience. The reception team were brilliant, can't fault them.

In summery, i'd do some research on the customer experience side of things, else where. It's not a cheap holiday and to be limited on very drinks, with aggravation, isn't my idea of an all inclusive break, when you work hard all year.",Date of stay: September 2019,Occidental Ibiza,4,"Ibiza, Spain"
"Great value, quality food and welcoming staff",I was with a wedding party for 2 weeks touring around Italy. I chose my final 3 days (September) to chill out and wind down in Varregio. I tried a few places to eat however Sa Player for me was exceptional and very reasonable price wise. I would highly recommend!,Date of visit: October 2017,Sa Playa,4,"Viareggio, Italy"
Traditional welcoming stay,"Well within budget and for the price you wouldn't need anything more. This is a lovely guesthouse, approx 130 years old and full of character. The couple who run it, are very welcoming and friendly. They do not speak much English, which is good for me - it makes the visit more authentic, traditional and very Italian. I would highly recommend this place.",Date of stay: September 2017,la Petite Maison,4,"Viareggio, Italy"
Well worth it - don't hesitate,"Quality day out, even if you don't fish. A nice trip on the boat in the sun, fish if you want to and then choose to swim once anchored up. The best bit is the food served. Lot's of it and all fresh. I've never tasted fresh fish as good. Fully worth it.",Date of experience: May 2017,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
