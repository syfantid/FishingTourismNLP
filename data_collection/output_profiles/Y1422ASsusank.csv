Magic cruise,"Absolutely luxurious cruise, suburb hospitality. Brilliant barbecue, visiting amazing beaches. For me I loved the tranquility.",Date of experience: October 2020,Kefalonia Cruise Lady O,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Excellent horse riding,"The stable is run by Pantelis. A true animal lover. He not only teaches riding and hacking but re homes ex race horses and abandoned and abused horses. The care and connection he has with the horses is immediately apparent. His home/farm/stable are beautiful, in traditional Kefalonian style.

A friend and I went on the beach trail. Neither of us having ridden for a number of years. His patience with us and instruction was brilliant. His overall concern was for both our safety and that of the horses. A beautiful morning in olive groves right down to the beach.",Date of experience: October 2020,Kefalonia's Horse Riding Stable,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Best restaurant in Sami with magnificent view of harbour,"Excellent food, fantastic staff, amazing ambience, what more’s to be said. We were staying in Agia Efimia during and after cyclone 2020. Contessina became our retreat from the devastation in Agia Efimia. We were always made welcome by their very entertaining staff.

Getting down with the locals,"Loved this cafe - right on harbour side of Agia Efimia. Open from very early til very late. Mostly ate breakfast here. Food excellent and beautifully presented. The staff can’t do enough to help you, always with a friendly welcome. Many local residents frequent cafe, which is always a good sign in my book. Sit, chill, eat and make friends you never knew you had. We were here during cyclone and after the cafe stayed open and continued giving their superb service. Brilliant!",Date of visit: September 2020,Gialos Cafe Bar,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Paradise describes restaurant perfectly,"Nikitas and his family are perfect hosts, with a genuine pleasure in engaging with their customers. Perched above the. Beach at the tip of Agia Efimia. The views of the magnificent bay and Ithaca are magical.

The wide array of food is divine, we had the pleasure of experiencing much of it as it became our favourite restaurant. We were also staying in Agia Efimia during the cyclone, despite the terrible devastation of the town, the family continued to stay open and it became the perfect retreat high above the devastated town. I would highly recommend a visit to anyone visiting Kefalonia",Date of visit: September 2020,Paradise Beach Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Excellent seafood,"Beautiful surroundings, scrumptious food, excellent and charming service, very reasonable prices. Would highly recommend for single traveler, couples, families and everyone who appreciates excellent, locally caught fish and fresh produce.

Right on stunning shoreline of beautiful bay, time it to watch the sunset, magical!",Date of visit: September 2019,Lighthouse Taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Magical Fishing Cruise,"Getting down with the locals...... Well, what a perfect day spent with the wonderful, charismatic Efi and husband Dimitrios. Together with the fisherman of few words, Mohammed (but when he spoke, his words were kind and full of wisdom). It was magic watching him work those nets.

It was a day of fun, wonder, relaxation and laughter, gently cruising the coastline of Kefalonia. We stopped a few times to haul in the fishing nets and those who wanted to helped free the vast assortment of fish and crustaceans from the nets. A real education for a complete novice like me.

So we continued, anchoring twice to swim in exotic coves that were almost inaccessible by land.

Meanwhile, Efi magically conjured up the most delicious barbecued seafood feast, accompanied with local fresh salad and Efi’s secret recipe of buttery lemon potatoes. Not to mention carafes of local wine and fresh fruit.....

Amazing how sharing good food and a few glasses of wine can unite strangers into friendship, united by such a splendid experience!

Saying goodbye was hard. The end of a memorable day, feeling very happy and content. Very thankful to all three of our perfect hosts.",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
The perfect host,"I am just home from a magical 2 week stay at this charming venue. Just as Thomas Cook collapsed. Nicos and his family, despite the considerable problems this disaster posed for his business and family continued to charm his guests in his usual professional manner. It was my first visit to this fantastic resort, tucked in the hills, just a kilometers stroll from picturesque village and beach. I have every confidence that next season will flock back to his family run studios. Beautiful studios, with spectacular views, intimate, relaxed pool area with bar and restaurant area. Evening delicious barbecues, cooked by his talented wife. Reputation is everything on such a small island. Not all hoteliers in this area put their clientele’s needs first at this time. Indeed, some evicted their guests! Not Nicos, his patience was impressive and he could not do enough to ensure his guests stay continued as pleasantly as possible despite his personal dire circumstances. I hope I have the opportunity to return to thank him personally.",Date of stay: September 2019,Eryphilli,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Paradise,"Well, people make the place. A beautifully restored Riad, capturing it's authentic charm. Located in the midst of the charming Medina. Our room was delightful with stained glass windows, a traditional seating area. The bathroom was a dream with double sinks and a sunken bath large enough for two. The hotel. Has an amazing hammam and massage on request. There is a wonderful rooftop terrace, perfect for relaxing after a long day touring the souk!

Dinner was a sensuous experience, starting with an abundance of delicious appetizers, then dishes of choice.

The staff are delightful and can’t do enough to please, especially Aymone and Lahssan, just charming.

Overall an amazing experience and worth every penny of their very reasonable charges. Would highly recommend and we are looking forward to returning again in September .....",Date of stay: May 2018,Riad Rcif,1,"Fes, Morocco"
Delicious food by Chef Salim,"The ambiance of the dining area in Riad Rcif is beautifully authentic with large sumptuous couches in the traditional manner. Candle lit with the sound of soft cascading water.

The waiters, Lahssan and Aymone are charmingly elegant. A simple menu starting with a wonderful mezze followed by your dish of choice, cooked to perfection. Followed by fresh seasonal fruit and delicate sweets. I would highly recommend the restaurant and we rarely ate elsewhere.",Date of visit: May 2018,Riad Rcif,1,"Fes, Morocco"
Buying stock in London,"Delighted with this hotel. Great location if you're stocking up in Commercial road. Friendly staff. Nice, spacious, light, clean room. Ensuite bathroom. Air con etc etc. Couldn't be happier and for London prices - very reasonable I think.",Date of stay: March 2017,The Whitechapel Hotel,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Chilled,"Lovely place to stay. Chilled out, laid back. Off beaten track but a couple of minutes to restaurants, shops etc on cliff top and beach. Basic accommodation but overall atmosphere fantastic. I rented small bungalow with terrace. My own little house. Loved it. Clean with HOT running water. A huge plus. Nijaad the young manager is lovely, helpful and charming. Actually all the staff I met were lovely. Made friends with some of my neighbors, it is that kind of place. If you want to feel 'part' of Varkala I would highly recommend it. 5 star it's not but with cleanliness and charm it ticks all the boxes",Date of stay: February 2017,Jickys Nest,1,"Varkala Town, India"
Hotel with excellent staff,"My sister and I stayed at the hotel over Christmas 2012 and the New Year. I would highly recommend staying at the Beach side of the hotel,

We totally enjoyed our experience of staying at the hotel, he ambiance was excellent and the facilities superb. Being located right beside the beautiful private beach was a treat.

We stayed full board.The quality and presentation of the food was excellent and the waiting staff friendly and attentive.

I would go as far as to say that it was the staff at the hotel in general that made our stay most enjoyable. From the charming and helpful reception staff, for whom nothing too much trouble, to the super efficient and friendly waiters in the restaurants.

The accomodation was really nice, close to the pool, beach and all amenities.

Christmas eve was quite a celebration, with the children entertained and a lavish buffet and cocktails for the more mature. On New Years Eve a marvelous dinner party was laid on with excellent entertainment.

The only downside was the Spa - I'd give it a miss!",Date of stay: December 2012,Hotel Novotel Sharm El Sheikh,1,"Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt"
DO NOT stay here,"The most depressing hotel I have ever stayed in. This hotel has retained everything bad about the 1970's. The hotel and rooms drab and uninspiring. The elevator, when it chose to work, took an age and I found it easier to use the stairs to my second floor bedroom. The shower was cold. Breakfast was served in an overheated (canteen style) dining room. The food was inedible, I only went there the once. I chose to spend as much time away from the hotel as possible and only returned to sleep.",Date of stay: July 2009,Sandy Lodge Hotel,1,"Newquay, United Kingdom"
