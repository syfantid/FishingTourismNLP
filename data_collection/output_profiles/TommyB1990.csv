Delicious food and welcoming staff!,"Me and my girlfriend had a meal here whilst on our holiday and both enjoyed it very much. Micheal is a lovely and welcoming host, all the staff were helpful and friendly. Food was spot on and you can not argue with the prices at all, especially with the service they provide.

Well worth a visit",Date of visit: September 2019,El Greco Greek Restaurant,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
What an experience!,"Me and my girlfriend booked this fishing trip and absolutely loved it! Both men on board were very friendly, welcoming and helpful. You get great views of Rhodes on your way to the fishing spot too.

We caught plenty of fish between us and a variety which was excellent. Dragon fish and puffer fish been two for example. Whilst we were fishing the captain prepared a greek salad, once we were finished they take you to a nice spot to go snorkeling while they bbq the fish you caught.

Would highly recommend this trip for anyone. I enjoy fishing but my girlfriend has never really done much... she thought it was brilliant. Best trip we have both been on",Date of experience: September 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Our stay,"We managed to get a last minute booking at this little country pub. On arrival we were welcomed by a lovely woman who couldn't do enough really. We asked about taxis as we had booked a table in Ulverston and we wanted a few drinks. She said she would see what she could do. Unfortunately taxis are hard to get around that area as it's out if the way, so she offered to give us a lift which we was very humbled bye! After a lovely night in ulverston we had a few drinks in the bar and had a great night with the staff, locals and other gests! Breakfast was decent too",Date of stay: September 2018,The Ship Inn,4,"Ulverston, United Kingdom"
Nice stay!,"Me and my girlfriend wanted a little retreat so we chose kirkby lonsdale. On arrival the staff were very friendly. We stayed in one of the little cottages at the back of the pub. For the price we paid we were impressed, you can easily pay alot more and just get one room. The cottage was basic but was clean and big enough for two. Would recommend if you're planning a night or two at Kirby Lonsdale",Date of stay: August 2018,Kings Arms Hotel,4,"Kirkby Lonsdale, United Kingdom"
Amazing food and service.,"Me and my girlfriend were on a break in Ulverston and managed to book a table at short notice. All the staff were so friendly and knew what they were talking about with the food and drinks. Arguably some of the best food we have both had. Highly recommend, if you like tapas this is the place to go.",Date of visit: September 2018,L'al Churrasco,4,"Ulverston, United Kingdom"
Our stay,"The hotel is a big part of your trip away and this didn't disappoint! Me and my girlfriend stayed here for 3 nights for her birthday. They even left a little card and bottle of wine in the room, which was a nice touch. Breakfast was lovely and the room was always clean and fresh, the lobby was stunning and the staff were always there to help.

It was designated perfectly, not too far from the old town and right on the border of the new town. Plenty of tram stops near bye if you're tired of walking and plenty of restaurants near bye. Highly recommended!",Date of stay: January 2018,Grand Majestic Hotel Prague,4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
K the two brothers,"Great little gem tucked away in Prague. If you are like us and love your curry, this place is ideal. Me and my girlfriend visited here on the last night of our trip and were glad we found it. Lovely atmosphere, nicely decorated and clean. Food was gorgeous and our waiter Archit was very pleasant and helpful. If like us you're getting abit sick of the Czech cuisine and just fancy a decent curry house. Then I highly recommend this place.",Date of visit: January 2018,K The Two Brothers,4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
