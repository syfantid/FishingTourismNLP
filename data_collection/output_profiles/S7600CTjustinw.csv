Firstly it has an amazing selection of Fresh baked goods, if you can't find something you want to eat, something must be wrong with you. Secondly the staff are phenomenal they really go the extra mile to make sure everything is perfect. Thirdly it's open 24 hours what more could you want.",Date of visit: August 2019,Santa Irini Bakery,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Fabulous afternoon,"We started the trip off with a little bit of sightseeing. It was amazing to see the port and old town from the water. Then on to fishing, very helpful staff showing and helping people who had never fished. The fish were almost instantly on the bite. Nothing to big but plenty of little ones for the Bbq. After a while we moved spots to even more fish then on to the swimming spot. We used the mask that the boat had and spent a good 20mins looking at all the different fish and animals on the sea floor. This was followed by a fantastic Bbq of fresh fish, Greek salad, Bread and Fruit oh and of course plenty to drink. We can't say a bad word about our experience",Date of experience: August 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
"Fun, informative and the best tour in Madrid","We spent 4 days in Madrid and did 3 tours with Starwberry Tours. The old town, the new town and the Tapas tour. We would strongly recommend all these tours, our guide Rodrigo was full of information and passion. He really went the extra mile to make sure that we had a fantastic time and knew all the facts as well as plenty of local knowledge.
Thanks guys 10/10",Date of experience: May 2019,Strawberry Tours,5,"Madrid, Spain"
