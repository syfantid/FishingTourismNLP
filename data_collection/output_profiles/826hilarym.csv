Fantastic,"I can’t rate this taverna enough, the welcoming feeling you get when you walk in is fantastic. The food is absolutely fabulous, when we are on Poros we go to Petros Taverna every lunchtime and usually a couple of times in the evening. Honestly, wonderful food and Sophia and Maria are a wonderful team.",Date of visit: July 2019,Petros Taverna,1,"Poros, Greece"

Fabulous Restaurant,We've eaten here a few times and never been disappointed. Excellent food and good value for money. Very busy and bustling atmosphere. Definitely need to book in advance.,Date of visit: February 2019,Hattusa,1,"Sevenoaks, United Kingdom"
Fabulous Fishing Trip,"Amazing trip. Giannis met us with a beaming smile, his boat looking all lovely and clean, tea and coffee, pastries and beautiful fresh fruit and homemade lemonade was set out for our breakfast. Off to an exceptional start as far as a non fisherwoman is concerned!

The trip can be tailored to your requirements - we wanted to catch a big fish so went deep sea fishing, which proved to work very well as we caught a red snapper.

Whilst we went for a swim in the beautiful sea and a walk on a deserted beach, the fresh fish we caught were being prepared by Giannis for our lunch. Absolutely stunning.

I honestly cannot recommend this enough, a truly fabulous experience and not only for people who enjoy fishing.",Date of experience: July 2018,Poseidon Fishing Trips,1,"Poros, Greece"
Fabulous restaurant with exceptionally lovely people,"We had a couple of meals in the Poseidon restaurant. The food was fantastic, and even if you don't like fish, they do other tasty meals.",Date of visit: July 2018,Poseidon taverna,1,"Poros, Greece"
Delicious,"A wonderful restaurant, typically Greek food which is cooked to perfection. Dmitri and Maria do a fantastic job. Well worth a visit. I would highly recommend.",Date of visit: July 2018,Karavolos Taverna,1,"Poros, Greece"
"Fantastic view, fabulous food","We visited Petros Taverna whilst we were on Poros and were certainly not disappointed. The food was fabulous, freshly made every day. I had a gorgeous moussaka Monday lunchtime and when we visited Tuesday, they had made completely different food so I tried the green salad and an aubergine dish which was delicious. The staff, especially Sofia and her daughter, are brilliant and very friendly. They do beach service so you don't even have to move from your sun lounger. I cannot recommend this taverna enough. Definitely a five star!",Date of visit: July 2017,Petros Taverna,1,"Poros, Greece"
"Delicious steaks, stunning views","We visited Platanos Taverna in early July and it was absolutely brilliant. We had a wonderful meal, fillet steaks with sauce and chips with a delicious salad. The wine we had was lovely too. You can't beat the views overlooking the sea. Well worth the short walk up the hill. Highly recommended.",Date of visit: July 2017,Platanos,1,"Poros, Greece"
"Fantastic service, average fish",We had a lovely starter but I have to say both our fish dishes were very overcooked and the vegetables were very undercooked. There were lots of Christmas parties eating so didn't complain.,Date of visit: December 2016,Dukes,1,"Sidmouth, United Kingdom"
Lovely welcome and lovely hotel,"We stayed on 16 December, booked a double room overlooking the sea and were certainly not disappointed. With glorious views over the bay and a sweet balcony we couldn't have been happier. The breakfast was delicious, help yourself to pastries, fruit etc and a wonderful bespoke cooked breakfast. I would highly recommend this hotel.",Date of stay: December 2016,The Bedford Hotel,1,"Sidmouth, United Kingdom"
Very tired,"We stayed on 26 November. There was no hot water and the whole hotel was just a bit tired. Our rooms were not ready on arrival so we were offered a free drink in the bar. I ordered a St Clements (orange juice and bitter lemon) and told them what the drink contained. The bar staff pointed to the glass and said yes, I have a ""bit of lemon"" in the glass, no, I said, bitter lemon. Obviously she didn't listen and put half a pint of value orange juice and half a ""bitter"" in the same glass - not very pleasant. Still all quite amusing. I cannot believe that this is a 4* hotel and would not recommend it. On the plus side, it is in the middle of the City overlooking the Cathedral so very central.",Date of stay: November 2016,Mercure Winchester Wessex Hotel,1,"Winchester, United Kingdom"
Lovely food and very welcoming staff,"I booked two rooms to stay for two nights for 4 people and two dogs. The rooms were definitely in need of an upgrade but were certainly clean, as was the bedding. Rooms aside, the biggest draw at The Blue Boar Inn is certainly the staff and the evening meal. We ate there both evenings and both meals were absolutely delicious and served with very good humour and nothing was too much trouble. If we were going to Stratford again I would certainly return.",Date of stay: May 2016,The Blue Boar Inn,1,"Temple Grafton, United Kingdom"
Fabulous food and wonderful service,"We went to The Little Garden in Sevenoaks last night and had a fabulous meal. Our waitress was exceptionally good, bubbly without being over the top. I had the nachos, which I would highly recommend as they were delicious and followed it with the short beef ribs which were absolutely fantastic. I can't stress how tasty the food was and you paid for what you got on the plate, no additional charges for chips, salad or anything like that. My partner had asparagus and burger to follow which was also delicious. We will definitely be back, possibly tonight!!!",Date of visit: April 2016,The Little Garden,1,"Sevenoaks, United Kingdom"
Fantastic food and service,We had a wonderful meal at Oaks Spice on Friday evening. The staff were very helpful and the food was absolutely fabulous. Not too expensive and the menu is very varied so you should have lots of choice.,Date of visit: October 2015,Oaks Spice,1,"Sevenoaks, United Kingdom"
Lovely views,"We stayed here for two days, lovely hotel. We had a balcony room from which you could see Lyme Regis bay. The room itself was lovely. We ate in the hotel restaurant for the first night, don't be put off by their ""dress code"" - we went in in nice jeans and that was fine. The food was good, however, we ordered the steak and I think it would have been better if it had come with some sort of vegetables, just a few peas would have been good. I appreciate that we could have ordered vegetables separately but when you are paying a £6 supplement I presumed that there would have been something other than dauphinoise potatoes with it - we should have read the menu closer! We didn't eat in the second night but went to a very lovely Thai restaurant on the front.",Date of stay: October 2015,The Royal Lion Hotel,1,"Lyme Regis, United Kingdom"
Lovely pork sandwich,"Excellent hot meat sandwiches - lovely on a windy day. The good thing about The Whole Hog is ""when it's gone, it's gone"" - they don't just get a spare bit out of the back!",Date of visit: October 2015,The Whole Hog,1,"Lyme Regis, United Kingdom"
Wonderful staff,"We popped in here for a quick drink and the bar staff/landlady was absolutely lovely. Not overly in your face or anything but just the right warm welcome. We played ""shut the box"" and had a lovely glass of wine and a beer.",Date of visit: October 2015,The Volunteer Inn,1,"Lyme Regis, United Kingdom"
Wouldn't recommend,"We stayed one night at the Rico Shadow Guest House in Sri Lanka. We booked two delux rooms which were anything but. We had ""welcome"" written in flowers on the bed but the room was not welcoming at all, it was very dark, the door didn't fit properly so there were large gaps for insects to creep into the room. On the table there was a very helpful ""cockroach"" spray, which we didn't need to use. We did go to the restaurant where the food was very good and plentiful. Not somewhere I would go back to. However, if you were backpacking, it might suit. The website looks lovely but our rooms were certainly not.",Date of stay: March 2015,Rico Shadow Guest House & Restaurant,1,"Kammala North, Sri Lanka"
Stunning,"We stayed at the Madulkelle Tea and Eco Lodge for three nights on 28 February 2015 to 3 March. It was fantastic and the views were absolutely stunning. We were woken up at 5 am to music being played to call people to prayer which was absolutely wonderful so we were up in time to watch the fabulous sunrise. The infinity pool is breathtaking - literally, it was quite cold! My only negative comment would be that one member of our party is a vegan and they couldn't grasp the fact that she didn't eat either meat or fish - even having explained it several times. I would highly recommend staying at Madulkelle but if you have dietary requirements make sure that they are properly understood - she was offered mutton curry as a non meat alternative!!!",Date of stay: March 2015,Madulkelle Tea and Eco Lodge,1,"Madulkelle, Sri Lanka"
