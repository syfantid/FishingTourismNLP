An easy 5 STARS...! :-))),"Walked around Antigua for 3-4 hours on my first day to find my favorite spot to work from in peace. (Checking all/most of the ""wifi cafes."") This place is/was IT! :)
Bright. (Unlike many other rather DARK places/cafes in A.).
Nice design. Super-friendly & laid-back staff.
High-quality beverages.
5 stars well deserved.
I think I have gone EVERY DAY during my first 20 days in Antigua. ^_^
THANK YOU, Maria Andre, Remi, Ale & all others! *****",Date of visit: November 2019,Artista De Café,1,"Antigua, Guatemala"
Traumhaft schön!!!,"Die Bilder sprechen für sich... Man kommt sich vor wie in einem Traum.

Entspannung PUR.

Und Arsenis ist der beste Host, den man sich wünschen kann.
Super freundlich und hilfsbereit.

Bis nächstes Jahr! :-)",Date of stay: March 2019,Paros Afrodite Luxury Villas,1,"Paros, Greece"
FANTASTIC (the 5th Summer in a Row...),"Arsenis & Crew are THE BEST...

This was our FIFTH summer at the hotel.

And we were treated like FAMILY every time...

Amazing experience, as usual. Super-clean & super-friendly & generous!

See you next summer!! :-)))",Date of stay: July 2018,Afrodite Boutique Hotel,1,"Paros, Greece"
ATTITUDE ISSUE by some of the staff...,"Ms. ""curly hair, dark skin"" just let me know in no uncertain terms that I need to vacate my table and move to the bar or somewhere else inside. (On very sunny day)
""I need you to move to the bar or somewhere inside. You are 1, I have 5 people.""
That in itself I have no problem with. BUT, but, but: the WAY she said it & her ATTITUDE about it was 100% UNCOOL & yup, quite RUDE & UNPROFESSIONAL as well.
HINT, HINT: be cool & say it in a friendly way - and, yes, maybe even package it in a rhetorical question (""would you mind moving to...?"") There is a novel idea! ;)
To be fair, some of the other stuff was very friendly.
And it's a beautiful location. But who needs attitude/treatment like that? #isuredont #wontcomeback",Date of visit: December 2017,Faruk BaShuk,1,"Jaffa, Israel"
KICKED OUT FOR NO REASON…,"Nice place, IF you manage to stay inside! :) :(

Got KICKED OUT last Saturday for NO REASON.

Bouncer/door man called me & my friend to come outside - and told us to LEAVE.
(Mind you, I still had my half-full beer glass in my hand as well.)

We had been there for 30 min.

Reason given (after somebody translated it for us): ""you were here last night and ""caused trouble""/had arguments with other guests.""

NONSENSE. No arguments/disagreements of any kind were had.

I asked him to speak to the ""manager"" - he didn't care & pretended to not understand.

Went back to Nouvelle Vague (good tip!) afterwards, told our great waiter Amarildo there about what just happened. He served us 2 delicious rum-with-cinnamon shots on the house to make up for what we experienced (at checkpoint...).

Nouvelle Vague: classy

Checkpoint: not so much

Otherwise a nice place.

Good luck! (You may need it.)

PS: Possible reason:

that same night, during the 30 minutes we were inside, I greeted a woman I had spoken with a few days earlier, by lightly tapping her on the shoulder (to get her attention and say hello to her - she was turned the other way).
One of the employees working upstairs, who also stood close by, immediately gave me a weird look & gesture as in “hey, don’t do this!!” (because he knew I was a foreigner - and he ASSUMED (incorrectly!) that I didn’t know her).
Well…, turns out I DID know her. :) And she just turned around towards me, smiled & greeted me friendly.

Ahem, I get the impression the gentlemen working there are getting a little bit overly “territorial”…

And, dear Mr. Owner/Manager, should you read this: you may wanna consider the behavior of the gentleman at the door; same for his colleague upstairs. Not cool.

If somebody misbehaves: do what you have to do.

If somebody (me & my friend, in this instance) has good manners and does nothing wrong: don’t play babysitter for no reason and weirdly overreact and ask guests with unfinished drinks to leave your establishment. Not cool.",Date of experience: October 2017,Checkpoint Charlie Pub Tirana,1,"Tirana, Albania"
FANTASTIC! *****,"Just go...

Captain Anthi & Crew are super-nice.

Lots of fresh fish to catch & EAT. (From cages (for shrimps & octopus) & 1km-long net PLUS you can fish yourself.)

Fresh shrimps (caught in hand-made cages by Anthi's father)... super-big octopus.

Time well spent. ***

PS: finally getting to experience the famous ""hot springs"" was my personal favorite, though. Unforgettable.",Date of experience: August 2017,Giorgaros fishing tours Santorini,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Just finished our THIRD summer here - always a PLEASURE! ***,"So nice on so many levels...

We just finished our third summer vacation here.

Arsenis, Akis & the gang treat you like FAMILY!

You will not regret it...

* great location (5 min walk to beach)
* very clean
* very fair prices
* super-friendly service

Do I sound like I have been bribed with their fantastic GREEK SALAD (cucumbers, tomatoes, capers & olive oil come from HIS DAD'S GARDEN!) to write such an awesome review?? ;)

I promise: I have not. (It was the TUNA salad - also really good!)

Just GO...

Also: Aliki is a nice little town - quiet... some simple taverns... no tourism overkill... no craziness...

See you there next summer (our 4th time...)",Date of stay: July 2016,Afrodite Boutique Hotel,1,"Paros, Greece"
GREAT! Just go...,"Third year in Aliki/Paros and fourth or fifth time doing this boat trip.

Elias is a total sweetheart and they are taking great care of you and take you to some truly beautiful places.

Totally worth it. Just GO! ;)

PS: If you want a nice HOTEL: check Hotel Afrodite in Paros - 3rd summer there. Just as great...! ***",Date of experience: July 2016,Rofos Boat Tours,1,"Paros, Greece"
SUPER! Authentic experience... *** Wie bei Mama zuhause!,"Ich bin Deutscher, und das war genau wie in Bayern oder Oesterreich.

Gulasch... Wurstsalat... Powideltascherl...

Alles FRISCH zubereitet. Und ein netter, lustiger oesterreichischer Herr/Besitzer dazu.

SEHR zu empfehlen! ***

ENGLISH VERSION:

I am German - and this is the REAL DEAL!

All freshly prepared. And tastes pretty much the same as walking into a Bavarian or Austrian place in the original country!

That is VERY rare.

Just go, and enjoy the experience... :-)",Date of visit: September 2015,Bistro Portosol,1,"Salvador, BA"
Sehr guter Tip!! Einfach HINGEHEN...,"Sehr guter Tip!! Einfach HINGEHEN...

Wohne schon 1.5 Jahre in Athen und hab's leider erst vor 6 Wochen entdeckt.

Lecker!
Frisch!
Preiswert!
Freundlich!

Und auch ungewoehnlich... (nicht die typischen griechischen Gerichte).

Und Maria, die nette Besitzerin ist auch super...

Da kann man nichts falsch machen... Viel Spass! ***",Date of visit: June 2015,Ta Karamanlidika tou Fani,1,"Athens, Greece"
Excellent! Coming back in a month... :),"I just spent 2 weeks with my 7-year-old daughter at Hotel Afrodite.

In one word: EXCELLENT!

Hotel Afrodite (and Aliki itself) is a GREAT TIP. ***

Actually, planning to come back with a friend for a week in early September...
(My friend will scuba-dive.)

Arsenys (the owner & manager) & co really CARE. And it shows...

What's not to like...?

* very clean
* small, ""family business atmosphere"" - but still very professional
* cute rooms
* nice beds/mattresses
* nice & cozy outdoor area (around the pool); perfect to hang out there on a windy day
* pool & gym
* 2 min walking to the beach (nice & also reasonably priced fish restaurants!)
* totally friendly & helpful staff

And very reasonably priced on top of all of that.

Aliki overall also great!
Not overly touristy...
(If you want more ""action"" you can take the bus (or rent a quad for 20 Euro/day) and go to NAUSSA - which is also cute, but a LOT busier and touristy.
But it's actually so cute with all its little shops, etc. that one can overlook/forgive the touristy part... Still, personally, I much prefer ALIKI and HOTEL AFRODITE as a ""home base"" for my vacation.)

As said, great, reasonably priced food at the fish restaurants by the water. (Great scenery... your table could literally be right by the water...)

Amazing & NOT CROWDED beach 5 min walking from ""Aliki port"" (which itself has a nice beach, actually.)
(No beach bar... which is GOOD... no stoopid electronic music forced on you...
Great water; sand in the water, not rocks; and stays shallow for a long time = great for smaller kids!)

Enjoy!",Date of stay: July 2014,Afrodite Boutique Hotel,1,"Paros, Greece"
Excellent Tip and a Great Find! ***,"Excellent Tip and a Great Find! ***

Was here a few times now.

What's not to like? Answer: nothing!

* Cute atmosphere (inside & out)
* Very friendly owner & staff
* Food tastes fresh & yummy
* very generous portions
* surprise desert (no charge) and desert wine (no charge)
* Very reasonably priced

10 Euro MENU I had for lunch got me:
* APPETIZER: I had a very tasty salad (cabbage, carrots, lettuce) with a very nice honey-mustard dressing
* 2ND COURSE: small plate of great Mushroom Risotto
* 3RD COURSE: VERY tasty Moussaka (tasted like grandma made it!) - very generous size! (Took some home... and I eat a lot!)
[Had also the pork steak before; also very good!)

1/4 liter of nice house white wine: 2.5 Euro

PLEASANT SURPRISES (no charge!):
* DESSERT: yummy chocolate halvas
* DESSERT: red dessert wine (with honey ;)

The very friendly owner requested, I should take a picture of his sign advising of the - for Greece highly unusual - ""NO-TOURIST-HUNTING POLICY"" ;) (See pictures!).

He is proud of no staff standing in front of his place, trying to lure prospects walking by in with ""HELLO!..."" or ""PLEASE..."" or ""SIT HERE...""

Works for me! :-)

Overall: very much recommended for a tasty, inexpensive meal in cute (and quiet) atmosphere.

3 min from touristy Monastiraki - but feels like you are in a VILLAGE.

Enjoy!",Date of visit: June 2014,To Krasopoulio tou Kokkora,1,"Athens, Greece"
Not as special as it seems...,"Went there with the expectation of getting some ""especially nice"" food.

Did not happen.

Appetizer:
Beet salad with goat cheese: loveless (dressing) and not much taste
8.5 Euro

Liver: ok... average. Not special.
13 Euro

Glass of white wine (lease expensive one): $4+
Was pretty nice.

27 Euro (incl. bread for 2 Euro)

TOO MUCH (for Athens standards) for what I received in exchange!
(Could stuff myself for 10-15 Euro at NIKITAS or places around there with simple & very good food.)

If you want something ""especially nice,"" go to POLLY MAGGOO.
Kicks Kuzina's butt big time...

Or KOUTALAKIA.

Those 2 places (Polly Maggoo & Koutalakia) REALLY care to deliver some food that makes you go ""mmmmm..."" with every bite!
And they accomplish it. :)

After Kuzina, I felt kind of taken advantage of.
If you act fancy and charge more: also DELIVER more.

I will not go back.",Date of visit: May 2014,Kuzina,1,"Athens, Greece"
