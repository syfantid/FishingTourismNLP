Boat trip Milos,"We highly recommend to do the trip. We were out for 7 to 8 hours. Exploring the west coast of the island, up to kleftiko. Fresh fish for lunch. Anchored in 3 bays and also could swim there.
Very nice experience!",Date of experience: April 2019,Milos Fishing Trip,4,"Milos, Greece"
Regular food and not fresh.,"Don't recommend this place! The goulash soup was not very tasty.
My fryed meat was old.
You could even smell the stick of it on the dish. Not many people come here and it seems to be for a reason.
The food gets 0 stars and 3 stars for the location.",Date of visit: July 2018,A-Pecsenyes,4,"Budapest, Hungary"
Gut und teuer,"Der Burger ist gut und lecker kostet aber im Schnitt 11-12 EUR, ohne Beilage. Das Blech Pommes ebenfalls 12 EUR. Der Liter Bier 12 EUR.
Also relativ teuer. Recht lange aufs Essen gewartet, ca 40 min. Getränke sau teuer, haben ca. 1000% Marge. Sanitäranlagen verbesserungswürdig. Öffentliche Toiletten im Gang zum Parkhaus. Daher max 4 Sterne.",Date of visit: July 2018,Kuhnstwerk,4,"Hannover, Germany"
Excellent restaurant,We especially enjoyed the mussels that come in a curry type sauce and toasted bread. Good service and reasonable prices. Highly recommended if you like fish.,Date of visit: September 2017,Fishhook,4,"Vancouver Island, Canada"
