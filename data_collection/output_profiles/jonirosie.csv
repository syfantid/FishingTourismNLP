"Excellent steak, lovely people.","Deliciously succulent steaks cooked over embers on a sunny day in Hackney. Sweetbreads and garlicky aubergines for starters. Sadly, we were too full for dessert, but our daughter loved her brownie with ice cream. Friendly, attentive staff. Good Malbec at just the right temperature and a rich, strong espresso to finish. Highly recommended.",Date of visit: August 2020,Buen Ayre,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Terrible service,The boat never turned up. We were waiting for over an hour. There was nobody from the company at the mooring to tell us what was going on. A group of handicapped kids gave up and went home. The Damme tourist office offered no help. In the end we found out that the boat had broken down from some other ex-passengers who had decided to walk back instead. Obviously the company couldn’t be bothered to tell anyone. Don’t bother with them.,Date of experience: August 2019,Canal Trip Bruges-Damme,1,"Bruges, Belgium"
Best Belgium meal of my trip,"Excellent family restaurant, very friendly staff and absolutely delicious food. Local food, great beers and out of the hustle and bustle of the centre of town.",Date of visit: August 2019,Usillia,1,"Sint-Kruis, Belgium"
Bad for kids,"Not good for kids. They asked us to wait for 20 minutes, then gave us a table, made us wait 15 minutes more before taking the order only to then tell us that they had a backlog and our food wouldn’t be ready for at least half an hour. The place was only half full. Judge for yourselves... Our 9 year-old wasn’t impressed.",Date of visit: August 2019,La bella trattoria,1,"Virton, Belgium"
Peaceful and beautiful,Friendly family-run apartments with lovely garden overlooking bay. Vine-covered terrace. Short walk down steep steps to peaceful pebble beach. Good restaurant (King Konoba) nearby and bus stop for No 10 bus to Dubrovnik. A great place to escape the crowds of Dubrovnik.,Date of stay: June 2019,Apartments Matusko,1,"Mlini, Croatia"
"Lovely food, friendly people","Delicious grilled meats, have yet to try the fish but it looked great. Very welcoming and good service. Nice view over the bay.",Date of visit: June 2019,King Konoba,1,"Plat, Croatia"
Unfriendly and unhelpful,"A nice location and reasonable food, spoilt by really poor service and grumpy staff. We waited for over an hour and a quarter with a 9-year old kid getting more and more tired. Lord knows how long it takes when they get busy. Not much fun if you aren’t a smoker, either... Go to the excellent Konoba King instead.",Date of visit: June 2019,Konoba Poseydon,1,"Plat, Croatia"
Fantastic pool and lovely people,"We stayed in one of the studio appartments which was very clean and plenty big enough for the 3 of us. Stunning views over lovely countryside with the sea in the distance.

Our daughter (8) loved the pool. Very comfy loungers, plenty of shade and a great bar/restaurant area.

We walked to local beaches and enjoyed Nicole's lovely home-cooked meals for the first few days before hiring a car and discovering this beautiful island.

The weather in June was fantastic and we were grateful for the aircon (and that fantastic pool....) There is also a friendly local shop within easy walking distance for provisions.

Fantastic value, very welcoming and we would definitely recommend it.",Date of stay: June 2018,Vyzantio Apartments,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Do something different!,"A great day out with a lovely crew, great food and great company.
