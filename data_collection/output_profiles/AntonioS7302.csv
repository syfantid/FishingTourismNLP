Trip to Polyaigos,"Totally recommended!!
I had the pleasure to make the boat trip around polyaigos with them. We saw stunning beaches as we have never seen before. Moreover, the captain and Andreas were always looking after us and they were super nice. The fish was taken and cooked in front of us so more fresh than an ice cream. The food cooked was super tasty. Unbeatable experience. Regards from Spain and Italy.",Date of experience: August 2019,Milos Poseidon Boat Fishing & Tours,5,"Milos, Greece"
