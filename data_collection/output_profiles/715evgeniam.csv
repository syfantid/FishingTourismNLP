The only way worth seeing Skiathos!,"We didn’t really liked Skiathos until we went on Dimitris boat tour! Starting from the boat and the owner till the view, the unique waters we swam in and the amazing sunset hour, everything was beyond my expectations! I could include sea urchins in the menu for the rest of my life! Absolutely don’t miss the chance to merge into sea life!",Date of experience: July 2018,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
