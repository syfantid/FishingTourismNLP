Excellent Day out on the sea,"If you fancy a change from sunbathing and doing something a little bit different, I would recommend you try this trip with Captain Georgios and his crew, Set sail from Zante Town about 07.30 sail for approx 1 hr then put the nets in, move closer to the shore have some breakfast / refreshments then set sail to pick the nets up then watch Gergios and his crew land the fish, then some are cooked aboard and served with spaghetti / rice local wine / local beers, fruit. Lovely day out and a stop for swimming / relaxing. 5 star day out",Date of experience: September 2018,Zante Fishing Tours,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
