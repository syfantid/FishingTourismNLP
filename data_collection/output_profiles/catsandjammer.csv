Exceptional in all ways,"I booked the Chef's Tasting menu as a surprise for my husband, and everything about our experience exceeded my expectations. From the moment we arrived, the service was attentive and warm. We were early, and there were no seats at the bar for waiting, so we chatted with one of the hosts/servers until our table was ready. By the time we were seated, we'd already gotten several drink recommendations which is always nice when you're eating somewhere for the first time or if the place has a changing drink selection.

Every one of the dishes was superb, and for a tasting menu, the portions were generous. Some of my favorite dishes were the scallops, the beet salad, the bone marrow, the carrots (I know carrots don't sound exciting, but these were seriously delicious), and, of course, all of the desserts. Throughout our meal, the staff was polite, meticulous, friendly, and engaging while allowing my husband and I to enjoy the meal and each other's company. They went above and beyond to make the night special for my husband as we were celebrating a milestone for him.

The atmosphere was perfect with a table near the kitchen so we could watch the different dishes being prepped. We loved getting that behind-the-scenes kind of glimpse into the process. (However, if that's not your taste, they do have other equally lovely seating areas.)

I cannot say enough good things about our dining experience. Fantastic food, drinks, service, and atmosphere. What more can you ask for?",Date of visit: January 2019,Blue Duck Tavern,5,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"
Very interesting Sarajevo history,"I went into my Bosnian trip with very little historical information, and Edin's walking tour really provided an interesting and informative education about Sarajevo as well as general history of the region. I learned so much, got to see a lot, and really enjoyed the tour. I would highly recommend it.",Date of experience: July 2018,Meet Bosnia Travel,5,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"
The best day in Milos,"My husband and I did this as part of our honeymoon a few weeks back, and it was just the best way to spend a day in Milos. Nikos, Frossa, and Simon are so welcoming and friendly. They made the whole day just lovely. When we had a 26 hour flight delay, they were completely flexible in rebooking us for a day later than we had planned. Like others have said, don't eat before you go. There will be fresh salad, fish stew (made fresh with whatever comes in the net that morning!), fried fish, breads, desserts, fresh fruit, beer, wine, water, soda, etc. We left SO full and relaxed after a beautiful day. The only downside was the wind and clouds, but the fact that we had such an amazing time in spite of the cooler weather really speaks to what a great experience this is. It was, without a doubt, the highlight of our honeymoon. Thank you!!",Date of experience: June 2018,Milos Fishing Experience,5,"Milos, Greece"
