Great Experience,"excellent trip, great fun with my 12 year old son who enjoyed every minute. Once you pass Tower Bridge there are no speed restrictions which means you are zooming all over the Thames to a great soundtrack. Stacey and Mike great hosts and Stacey offered some great histort info to the trip that even a Londoner didn't know!

Many Thanks will be definately doing this trip again",Date of experience: August 2020,High-Speed Thames River RIB Cruise in London,4,"London, United Kingdom"
