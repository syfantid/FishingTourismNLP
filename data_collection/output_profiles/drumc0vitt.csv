A lovely return visit,"We visited Paxos and stayed at Bastas in 2003 on a Olympic package holiday. Fast forward sixteen years and we returned with two children in tow for a short visit tagged onto a holiday to Corfu to see if the island, and Bastas, lived up to our special memories. In short - it did.

All the things that makes Bastas special are still there and some more modern changes have been made which have improved the hotel.

On this visit we booked directly and were given two front facing rooms next door to each other with large balconies. Yes, the rooms are basic and quintessentially Greek, but they met our needs and were kept spotlessly clean. The rooms cost 65 Euros each per night, this included air conditioning (and toilet rolls!). I would imagine that criticism given to the hotel by some for the additional charges/restriction of these items is down to the low price per night given to the hotel from Olympic Holidays and the hotel's need to protect their margins and make enough money to keep the business sustainable. If you want the hotel to stay open they have to make money. Given the amount we paid per night (which we consider extremely good value especially in Paxos in high season) I cannot think for a second that the owners of Bastas are being greedy or tight fisted but are only doing what is necessary to keep the business going.

The staff at the hotel were, without exception, friendly and helpful. We booked a return transfer from the port in Gaios from Bastas. Babis did both journeys and met with us once we were settled in to give us key information about the island, things to do etc. which was really helpful.

Bastas has such a lovely, relaxed vibe. The pool and the views from it were lovely and the location cannot be beaten. It's a very special place to stay. Thank you Babis and all at Bastas for another special stay. We will be back, next time for longer.",Date of stay: July 2019,Bastas Hotel,4,"Paxos, Greece"
Excellent walking tour with a superb guide,"We did the London East walking tour with Matthew who combined his enthusiasm and passion for his home city with his extensive knowledge of London's (and the UK's) history from the Roman age to recent architecture to provide an exceptionally enjoyable 2.5 hour tour of the City of London. Well paced, eloquent and with the right blend of humour and natural story telling. Well done Matthew, we wouldn't hesitate to recomend you or the tour to anyone interested in learning more about this amazing city.",Date of experience: September 2017,Strawberry Tours,4,"London, United Kingdom"
The nicest restaurant we have eaten in in Argostoli,"This is our fourth trip as a family to Kefalonia and on our last night we tried Ampelaki. It was by far the nicest restaurant we ate in this visit, the setting, ambience, food and service were excelleny. Having eaten in Casa Grec for the first time this visit I can say that Ampelaki beat it hands down and I wish that we had decided to eat here that night instead. So if, like us, you are reading these reviews to see which restaurant to go to for a special evening I whole heartedly recommend Ampelaki.",Date of visit: July 2017,Ampelaki Greek Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fabulous fishing adventure,"My family and I (2 adults and 2 children aged 10 and 12 years) had a brilliant day fishing with Efi, Dimitrios and Mohammed. The morning started with delicious treats, coffee and juice before setting off to haul the fishing nets in which had been laid much earlier in the morning. It was really interesting and informative, particularly for the children, to see where and how we get our fish.Among the catch was a flying fish, an octopus, cuttlefish, baracuda as well as many many more types of fish. Those that wanted to were encouraged to get close to the fish, helping to identify them and throwing some to the ever eager seagulls flying and following in wait. Once the catch was in we moved off to a bay where you could swim, sunbathe or watch as the fish were sorted. Efi cooked the most amazing lunch seemingly effortlessly, everything freshly caught or home grown. We really couldn't have wished for more and certain my have never eaten that quality of fish before. Afterwards the children, having expressed an interest, were give rods and lots of help and encouargement to fish from the boat and had immediate success, this time returning the fish alive to the sea. Before returning to the harbour there was an additional opportunity to fish or swim and we had a delicious fruit salad. The best and most memorable part of the day though was Efi, Dimitrios and Mohammed themselves who couldn't have been more friendly, informative or helpful. From the warm welcome to the ongoing care and attention, the fishing lessons and fabulous hospitality we were thoroughly spoiled. They work so hard and deserve every success.",Date of experience: July 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Fabulous, friendly taverna","We stayed in a villa near Milos in Farsa and ate there several times during our stay. We have visited Greece many times and Kefalonia several times and we can honestly say that this is the friendliest taverna we have ever visited. From the first visit we were made to feel like friends, the children made to feel especially welcome. The food was excellent, the specials particularly so and such good value. Poppy and Kostas work so hard and have created something very special, the food, the welcome, the stunning view and the playing. Stop in if you are passing, you won't regret it. We will be back! From Anna and her family!",Date of visit: July 2017,Milos Taverna,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fabulous Jeep Safari,"We (family with 2 children - 10 and 12 years old) went on a Jeep Safari with Kostas and cannot recommend the trip highly enough. We visited places we would be unable to access on our own, despite having visited the island several times, hiring cars throughout and exploring widely across the whole island. The best part of the trip however was Kostas himself. He is a really engaging guide with a real knowledge and love of the island, its nature and it's people and their history. We all learned so much from him and he really engaged well with the children, so much so that we have booked to go on his stargazing tour before we return home and the kids (and parents!) can't wait.",Date of experience: July 2017,Wild Nature Expeditions,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Thought you had tasted honey? Think again!,"We visited Thanassis and Eleni at Dias Apiary today and can honestly say that the experience more than lived up to the reviews here. We learned so much about keeping bees and the honey production and have come away with the greatest respect for these clever and productive little insects. Best of all though was the warmth and generosity of the hosts, who went above and beyond to look after us. The sampling of all the products was simply stunning, and we all felt that today was the first time we had ever really tasted honey and Eleni's baked goodies were amoung the best things we've eaten on holiday. Thank you both so much, we had a beautiful morning.",Date of experience: July 2017,Dias Beekeeping,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Very Enjoyable Visit,"Family visit at lunch and for an evening meal found helpful and very pleasant staff (best we have encountered on our summer holiday so far), attentive service and a willingness to guide us through a no-nonsense, tasty menu of freshly prepared, local produce. Extremely good value for money.",Date of visit: July 2016,La Flor de la Esquina,4,"Toledo, Spain"
The best villa we have stayed in,"We stayed in Villa Prokris for our two week holiday in Kefalonia this year. Following a lot of research we chose this villa based on the location and price and we are so pleased that we did! We were looking forward to our holiday but the villa far exceeded our expectations and made our holiday really special. You get a lot of villa for the price, it is airy and spacious, having three large bedrooms and bathrooms and a large kitchen/diner/sitting room and separate utility room. It was spotlessly clean, is finished to a very high standard and has everything you need to make it a 'home away from home'. The villa stayed cool in the day and the aircon was great at night. The pool was larger than we had expected and kept the children entertained for hours on end and the garden and outside areas were exceptional, with a mix of paving, grass and planted beds. There are three outside seating areas which allow you space if you want it and sun or shade at any point in the day which we loved and made great use of. The villa, pool and garden were of high quality, really well maintained and made our holiday a luxurious and relaxing experience. The villa is located in a village called Razata which is a couple of miles outside Argostoli and the villa has lovely views over to Argostoli and the sea. There is place to eat within walking distance which did great Souvlaki, you can eat in or take away, they will even deliver! Just down the road is a shop which was well stocked and the larger supermarkets were no more than a ten minute drive away. TIna and Makis were amazing hosts, you can see they take a lot of pride in the villas (Villa Kefalos is next door) and the hard work they put into them shines through. They were so friendly, very helpful and available if you needed anything. We genuinely could not fault anything to do with our stay. We will be back! Thank you Tina and Makis, we wish you all the best for the rest of the season.",Date of stay: June 2014,Prokris Villa,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
A friendly B&B set in a beautiful location,"We found Rye Hill Farm on the internet as we needed somewhere to stay for two nights and have two small children that needed some space - Rye Hill Farm looked perfect. We had the family room which we found to be fine for us and most importantly was very clean. Elizabeth was a very friendly and helpful host and the breakfast was great - really good ingedients used and freshly cooked. The setting couldn't have been better and the children loved the pigs/piglets. chicken, bantums, dog and cat. we would stay again and would recommend this B&B. Rye Hill Farm also does self catering and has a campsite.",Date of stay: August 2009,Rye Hill Farm,4,"Hexham, United Kingdom"
