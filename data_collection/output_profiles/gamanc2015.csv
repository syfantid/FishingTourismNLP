A unique experience that shouldn’t be missed,"A special day spent with special people that are passionate about what they do, at the end even preparing us an absolutely exquisite meal from the fish caught on board.
The ride is a commercial fishing ship that fits a maximum of 10 people and doesn’t cause nausea.
It is incredibly clean and well taken care of.
The commercial net fishing is an experience absolutely worth trying.
Way more interesting and engaging than a simple tourist boat trip around the island.
We even had the chance to anchor the ship near a private island and swim by marvelous views.
Giorgos, the ship’s commander, is an incredible person, very welcoming and friendly.
It was an absolute pleasure listening and learning about all the wonders of Greece.
From interesting facts about the island to amazing tavernas known only by locals.
Took his recommendations to heart, the culinary experience being unbeatable.",Date of experience: June 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Try to avoid. HORRIBLE!,"First, let's be honest: this is NOT a four stars hotel. It is a very good two stars hotel or just a bad three stars one. The rooms are so smal that you can hit yourself on the walls after you get out of bed. They have also heating system, but during a cold rain, at 14 C (57 F) temperature the management consider that is not the right time to turn it on. Hope that we will be back home in good shape! For your reference, few pics attached",Date of stay: June 2017,Cocor Spa Hotel,1,"Neptun, Romania"
