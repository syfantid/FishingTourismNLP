A little late review!,"I went back to Skiathos this summer and could not find the hotel website to book it again and i was a huge disappointment!I was looking forward to see Yiotti and Babis again!Lovely couple and guest,they received you with the greek hospitality that i am used for.Babis pick you up from the
airport and drove me to the port when i left to Skópelos!
The view is amazing.The room is simple,but very cozy!
Next time i go back,definitely i will stay there!",Date of stay: August 2018,Babis Hotel,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
So worthed the climb!,"I hate Abba,don’t give a damm about the Mama Mia movie,but i stayed in Glossa this time instead to Skópelos town..and i am in love!
Ioukrati is exactly what the doctor prescribed!
The beaches at the north are more difficult to get than in the south,there is no bus line like in the south,and if you want to go to Agios Ionnis prepare to walk..
A good trainer,water and energy to climb the 289 steps..but the view from the chapel is stunning!!
When you get up,light some candles and let a donation ️
Going down the beach is another challenge,but onceyou get there..just throw yourself in the water!!
Rent a car,but if you don’t take the cab with Giannis or Rania..is worthed the cab fare!!!
Simplicity and lovely people is Glossa..next time i will be there again!",Date of experience: August 2018,Agios Ioannis Beach,5,"Skopelos, Greece"
The best of Skiathos!,"It is my second time in Skiathos and my second fishing trip with Dimitris..He is the best guide/fishing instructor in Skiathos /Skópelos.Fun for all levels,kids will have loads of fun,and adults too!Refreshments,fruits and you keep your catch,take to the taverns and have a fantastic meal!
For the ones that likes a little bit more challenging,i recomend the night fishing for squid!If you don’t get one squid,you at least have a laught (or get a water squirt right of your face,squids have a very good aim!)
No look further,go straight to the New Port and look for Skiathos fishing trip!",Date of experience: August 2018,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
