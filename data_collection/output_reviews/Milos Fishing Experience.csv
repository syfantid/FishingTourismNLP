FANTASTIC,"Wonderful boat trip to Polyaigos!We went with my wife to Kimolos, and went to the trip. the boat has 10, 12 persons, enough space for all. You can see all the process of taking the fish from the net they put in water the day before, see fishes one by one, and after see them in your plate, fantastic food!! The captain and captenissa are 2 wonderful person that will explain you all the things you have to know, and take you to the best beaches!! It s 80€ per person, but 8 hours, very good food, company, and good beaches, it s cheap!Highly recommended !"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vinzparini,August 2020,5,Best boat tour in Milos!! ,"Great couple, very friendly, very caring. Departed from Pollonia at 10.00 to go around the beautiful Poliaigos and returned at 18.00ish.. Great cook, and Super captain! "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthi2019,August 2020,5,A fantastic cruise in Polyaigos! Perfect hosts!,"We were in Kimolos just for two days and we  were wondering if it's worth to go to Polyaigos. Thankfully we went and we enjoyed not only the pure turquoise water of Polyaigos sea but also a real fishing experience, guided by Mr Nikos and Mrs Froso, who do this job for years and know everything about fishing! They are two perfect hosts who made us feel like our home from the first moment. We had the chance to see the whole process of picking the net together with all the fresh fish were being caught, clean them and, undoubtedly the best part, eat them!! After enough stops at the best spots around Polyaigos, where we could swim, dive and relax, we ate the ""kakavia"" meal, made by Mrs Froso. A soup with all these fish inside. It is rare to find it and it was so delicious! They served it to us with ""skordalia"" (kind of garlic sauce), salads and fresh bread. I also liked that they were just 10 people in the fishing boat and we were like company. As Mr Nikos told us they take 12 people max. The price is 80 euros per person, but it's not expensive if you think that snack, beverages, main meal, fruit and sweet are included and the duration is about 8 hours. Don't lose this trip if you are in Milos or Kimolos. Highly recommend it!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IamElenaP,August 2020,5,The highlight of 2 amazing weeks!,"We chose this fishing experience cruise in Polyaigos for the last day of our vacation and we couldn’t have chosen anything better! Captain Nikos and his wife, Froso, are 2 wonderful people who will make you feel the traditional greek hospitality from the first moment on the fishing boat. We did 3 cruises in total during our trip, but THIS one exceeded every other cruise. From the people on board, to the amazing locations of Polyaigos we visited and the best food we ate on board, all these made a wonderful experience that we will treasure! We did 5 stops for swimming in crystal green and blue waters and Froso kept on feeding us wonderful recipes of her own. Our lunch was FRESH fish that Captain Nikos caught in the morning and they made a traditional “Kakavia” (the fishermen’s fish soup). Thank you so much for this gift on an experience and we wish you to continue being as you are!"

0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeccaFann,September 2019,5,Highlight of our trip!,"We had the treat of spending the day with Nikos and Frosso and just one other passenger. The day felt so natural and relaxed, as if they were our friends and we were just joining them for a day of fishing and island hopping. They both took extra care to show us the beauty of their home, to feed us constantly, and to tailor the trip exactly how we wanted. Highlights include learning about the local fishery, swimming in the bluest water we have ever seen, watching them reel in the fishing nets to see what we had caught, enjoying a home-cooked lunch of fresh fish, squid, macaroni, salad, and delicious wine, all prepared on the boat by amazing Frosso! We felt like family and were sad to say goodbye to them at the end of the day. A perfect trip for couples, friends, or family, we hope to come back someday!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VasilikiKF,August 2019,5,The best thing we did in Milos!,"This is a must do experience. We recommend it to everyone who wants to swim in crystal blue waters, experience fishing and taste the most delicious fish soup. Frosso and Nikos are very friendly and excellent guests that will amaze you with their hospitality."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giannisk365,August 2019,5,Best Island Tour in Milos and Kimolos.,Mr Nikos and Mrs Froso gave us a unique experience. We felt as if we were relatives since they welcomed as on their fishing boat as if it was our own boat.Seeing fish being caught in the fishing nets with the local traditional way and being cooked by Mrs Froso while exploring the crystal cleal waters of Poluaigos island was something that we will remember for a our lifetime.When the cooked fish soup (kakavia) is served and you have the chance to eat freash -same day caught- fish you get yo know that it worthed every penny.Greek traditions and hospitality at their best!
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pierre-Davide-Ken,August 2019,5,An Aegean paradise experience,"The climax of our vacations in the Cyclade was with Frou-Frou & Nikos on our day trip to a secret island . They are both lovely persons, genuine and generous, they like to share their knowlege and experience of fishing and they cook for you an excellent lunch with the product of their fishing ; the scenery is just breathtaking . Thank you so much for disclosing us this little paradisiac island ."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikolask502,August 2019,5,A must do experience,"I did the Fishing experience with friends and family a few days ago. Mr Nikos and his wife are very friendly and know all the good spots and beaches! Mr Nikos picked us up from Kimolos at exactly the agreed time, we went and gathered the nets, and then went to a number of beaches for swimming. Mrs Froso cooked the fish we caught and made and excellent soup. I would totally recommend Mr Nikos and the Fishing Experience that he offers."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamescV4878YV,August 2019,5,"Very enjoyable trip, well worth the price","We were taken to a variety of different swimming spots around the island of polyaigos, including a couple with caves to explore.The pace of the trip was great and gave us plenty of time to relax and take in the sights of polyaigos.Nikos and Froso were happy to chat around the history of the island and overall provided a great service.We would absolutely recommend this trip to anyone visiting Kimilos."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiorgosS162,August 2019,5,A day in paradise,What an amazing experience! Frosso and Nikos are very welcoming and they treated us like family. They will take you to amazing places around polyaigos and cook the freshest fish for you. The food is cooked in the traditional Greek fishermen style from Ms. Frosso herself!Polyaigos has some of the most amazing waters we've ever seen. A paradise of the sea. Don't miss this trip if you are staying in Milos or Kimolos! Thank you for everything! Joanna and George.
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vageek,August 2019,5,An amazing experience!,"Do not leave the area without this experience! You can hop the boat from either Milos or Kimolos. Captain Nikos and his wife are the most wonderful couple to take you to a day-long journey to Polyegos and the surrounding area. The day starts with collecting the fish from the bottom of the sea - the very fish you are going to have for lunch later on! This is a difficult thing to organize; you need an excellent captain, an excellent cook and excellent and welcoming service. The couple offers all of the above with abundance, making the trip a memorable and must-have experience including fishing, swimming in the most gorgeous beaches in Polyegos, dining and sightseeing (with pirate story/telling!)Great to have this in your list!"

4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/917lauran,July 2019,5,Best experience ever !!!,"We had an amazing day with Nikos and his wife and it was certainly the best day of our 2 weeks vacation in the greek islands! I don't even know where to start... the fact that we are a small group on the host creates an amazing atmosphere. It's a very friendly day. We caught so many fishes and even an octopus! The food was more than good, it was simply amazing and in huge quantity. Nikos and his wife are the nicest persons we met, we almost left with tears in the eyes ! If you are looking for a real greek experience, authentic with amazing fresh fish (literally from the sea to the plate) do lot hesitate and book your tour !We will definitely do it again if we come.back to Milos. Thanks you so much for this day !!! "
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CConnell19,June 2019,5,Great Experience!!,"What a day!!  My 21 year old daughter found Nikos online, what a great find!!  Our family of 4 & a couple from Italy had an amazing day!  Come hungry!  Froso, Nikos wife is an amazing cook & there is plenty served!  They tweak trip based on what makes sense that day & what the group wants to do.   There’s other fishing trip options, that are bigger & more commercial...but for us this was perfect!  Authentic, laid back & delicious!!  A great way to see the island!! "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matteotacconi,July 2019,5,"Very friendly people, excellent fresh fish and great experience!","The fishing experience was enriching and one-of-a-kind, and the crew members friendly and thoughtful (not to mention incredible cooks). We watched them fish, name, and clean all kinds of fish (we even caught an octopus!) and observed other kinds of marine life at the same time. The route taken was varied and interesting, with some stunning waters, beaches, and volcanic rocks.This fishing tour is for people who enjoy eating fish, love the ocean water and want a truly Greek experience (and who want to taste the best fish broth they've ever had).If someone has issues with fish bones, we would recommend they call in advance and let them know, so they can serve and prepare additional food, which is what they did for us, as they are very accomodating and kind.Thank you Andreas, Andreas and Marios!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregn2019,July 2019,5,A MUST-DO experience in Milos!,"If you ever visit Milos this is a must-do experience. Fresh fish, the greek sun and sea with crystal clear water create an amazing feelling. You won't regret this for sure. As for captain Nikos and Froso what can I say, they are so heart-warming and authentic people that they made our trip just unforgetable. "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarieP3768,June 2019,5,Wonderful day!,"Enjoyed a lovely day with Capt Niko, his wife Frossa and 5 other friendly and interesting newly made friends. We were 9 total on this fishing boat, enjoying the amazing waters of Polyaigos and Kimolos. Every beach a wonder. Clean clear salty waters in semiprivate/private coves where you can swim to the beach and simply relax. A delicious meal was prepared from fish freshly brought on board by net. The hours passed peacefully and enjoyably. Looking forward to a return trip already. "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamcbowen25,June 2019,5,A Great Boat Ride,"Nikos and his wife Frossa were very welcoming and friendly hosts for the day. Frossa speaks great English, and made it very clear that the boat was to be like home! She said help yourself to whatever and you don’t need to ask me :) They immediately welcomed us with a coffee and explained what we were going to be doing for the day: pulling in Nikos’ net for the fish, and swimming at some of their favorite spots. They said whatever the group feels like doing, we can do! The food was amazingly fresh as you eat the fish pulled up right in front of you a few hours later. The couple is very knowledgeable about fishing in the islands, and explained the different kinds of creatures that came out of the net. This included red snapper, barracuda, shrimp, squid, crab, lobster, and even 2 sting ray! The only critique I would offer is that we didn’t have an opportunity to personally fish. They set the nets prior to the trip and they pull them up as our first stop. It’s a very cool experience to watch them pull in the catch but there wasn’t any hands on fishing as we expected from the description at the travel office. I think they would have let us fish with rod and reel had we asked, but they did say it wasn’t the right type of fishing for the time of year. No problem for us!! The boat would stop often for swimming and they were very flexible with timing as it’s a small private boat and not a large tour company. The island they visit has the clearest water I’ve ever seen! Over all, I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to get out on the water and see a different perspective of the Greek Islands! You’ll also have a wonderful time chatting with the friendly Frossa and Nikos, learning about their island life."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanlindquist,June 2019,5,Best Fishing experience on Milos!!,"Rosa and Nikos were extremely welcoming and made every effort to get us to have a great time! They took us to the most gorgeous, isolated aquamarine waters where we swam and then ate delicious fish, soup, salad and dessert prepared by them on the boat... of course using the fish just freshly caught... it was an unforgettable, authentic and traditional fishing experience that we would highly recommend to everyone! We felt like we were at home, part of the family with them. Efkaristo poli, Rosa and Nikos!-Susie and William,  Canada"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rogerromyn,May 2019,5,Great real experience ,"My girlfriend and I hade the most fantastic experience on board a real Greek fishing boat with a real Greek skipper and the freshest fish cooked by a real Greek lady ! The best day of the holiday fishing,eating ,drinking, swimming and chatting o and tanning THANKS NIKO !"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicolaBurge,May 2019,5,Authentic Boat Trip,"My husband and I (both 28 years old) were keen to see Poliegos as we heard it is beautiful. We heard about Nikos and his fishing experience from Dionysus at Rakomelo (another place in Pollonia you should definitely check out for their breakfast buffet - delicious!). There are a lot of ‘fancier’ yachts and catamarans you can book but to be honest, this trip is incomparable. We were lucky enough to have the boat to ourselves and Nikos and Frosa soon felt like family. We were able to watch the whole fishing process and swim at some of the most beautiful beaches in the world - in crystal clear blue water. Nikos and Frosa explained all the places, what we were seeing and where we were going to next and eating the fresh fish meal on board was soooo good! We are not fishermen by any stretch but this was one of the highlights of our two-week trip - an authentic, intimate Milos experience! Highly highly recommend for young families, couples (young and old) and small groups."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeePoint,May 2019,5,Amazing Experience - 100% suggested,"Meet a local fisher, discover the serene beauty of Polyegos and Kimolos unexploited blue waters and geological volcanic formations that will take your breath away! Experience a private boat fishing tour ( up to 12 people), with a fishing boat, sailing near the coast, visiting caves, diving and eating on board. This an authentic cultural experience, with fishers being our hosts, sharing their knowledge and hidden spots! The best way to visit the island by boat! Not to miss! Thank you Nikos"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/preemao,May 2019,5,Highlight!,"Nikos and his wife, Frosa are AMAZING! they are so warm and inviting. They took great care of us and made us the BEST meal we had in Milos!"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelleyb435,September 2018,5,a lovely day on the water,"My daughter (age 31) and i were in Milos for a few days..my daughter wanted to fish or go out on a small boat. We found Milos Fishing Experience and were so delighted we did.  We met the small fishing  boat in Pollonia , the boat was captained by Lizardos Nikolaos and his lovely wife.We were just 5 passengers which was perfect because the boat was small.. Our day was incredible, not only did we fish, swim in amazing coves, but were fed the most wonderful food...the fish we caught, greek salad, bread, wine, dessert it was a delightful day.I cannot say enough great things about this husband and wife team...they were charming , generous and sweet..I would not miss a chance to enjoy a day with them."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vanessapoh505,April 2019,5,Genuine Greek experience in Milos!!!,"Coming from Santorini where it was too cold to swim in this period, we were hesitant to go on another cruise...but it was the best decision ever! Captain Nikos and his wife treated us with much hospitality and kindness during the trip. It was a fun n unique experience eating the fishes from the fishing net. We learnt a lot from the couple and there was wonderful food served onboard. Fresh seafood, beer, dessert, wine and even fruits! Truly down to earth people that make Milos unique ;) "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/294skipt,April 2019,5,Wonderful way to spend a day on the Aegean Sea!,A great way to see the islands with your family.  Fresh cooked seafood for lunch caught on your way out to your destination.  It is a must for a first time visit to this island!
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadalenaCS,April 2019,5,Best Milos Experience,"The day with Nikos and his wife was the best experience in Milos. We were not looking for a fishing experience but we had a real surprise. We loved the full day and how they welcomed us on their boat. They made us feel at home and like we knew them for ages, introducing all the greek culture. I recommend it to anyone who is looking to immerse in the greek culture while checking the beautiful scenery."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnquarles,October 2018,5,Real fishing in Greece!,"My son and I vacationed for a week in Milos and wanted to arrange a guided fishing trip, something we do in most locations we visit. Nikos and his wife agreed to take Ben out even though we knew their season was coming to an end. The weather wasn't great, it rained most of the day. But Nikos and his wife were the most hospitable hosts, so kind and attentive to Ben. He enjoyed catching a snapper and several other fish, they enjoyed a nice lunch together. Ben has not stopped talking about what wonderful people they were. I hope they keep in touch. It was one of the great days of our time in Greece."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apexplorer2018,September 2018,5,Stunning Fishing and Swimming!,"We had an absolutely wonderful time on this trip and would highly recommend it to anyone considering it. The waters of Poliegos are incredibly beautiful, and it was really fun to see what we caught and have a beautifully cooked meal with the sea catch! Nikos and Frossa also were able to give us lots of insights about the area and good places to go, me it was a much more personal experience than a lot of the other boating trips we explored. I would 100% recommend!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rainbow7770,September 2018,5,Captain Nikos is a legend old school fisherman,"This boat represents the heart and soul of this island, he showed us how to put nets out and use rods. Then the fish we caught he cooked in a wonderful little cove. The boat is over 12 m long and we took out kids... they loved it.. Fishing snorkeling, local knowledge and cheap.. A MUST do"

3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leonidasp627,September 2018,5,Unique experience in Milos,"We had a very special day in Nikos and Froso's boat, traveling around the Polyegos island famous for the turquoise waters and caves.Watching real fishing with nets and preparing the lunch with the fish catch was an experience you cannot imagine.They were  very friendly and created a warm atmosphere during the day trip sharing  also secrets of fishing.Μοναδικη εμπειρία απο αυθεντικους ανθρώπους που ξεχωρίζει απο τα εμπορικά τουριστικά πακετα ""κονσερβα"".Μπραβο Νικο γίγανται"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/63shelleya,September 2018,5,Greek hospitality and fishing makes great memories,"We can't say enough about this trip, as soon as we walked onto the boat we were family! Captain Nikos and his wife Frossa welcomed us serving coffee while we waited for others to arrive. Nikos knowing that we wanted to fish allowed us to fish with rods and the other couples joined in with their first time rod fishing. Very exciting for every one. We had carpaccio with my fish before we were served an amazing lunch from the fish caught in the nets. Several stops to go swimming and just relax and enjoy the day. We were feed all day with delicious foods that Frossa created from her galley. It was definitely a great way to end our trip here in Milos."

This is a traditional fishing boat, so you get to see the fish being caught in the nets, but our children (12 and 9) also both caught fish using rods too. Very excited!We ate wonderful freshly cooked food, washed down with beer and wine (All drinks included). To top it all, we swam in the most stunning turquoise water all day. A perfect, relaxed and joyous experience.A truly memorable day...I can not recommend it highly enough.Huge thanks from us all,Jane Tom Henry and Sophie Lamb xxxSurrey, England"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catsandjammer,June 2018,5,The best day in Milos,"My husband and I did this as part of our honeymoon a few weeks back, and it was just the best way to spend a day in Milos. Nikos, Frossa, and Simon are so welcoming and friendly. They made the whole day just lovely. When we had a 26 hour flight delay, they were completely flexible in rebooking us for a day later than we had planned. Like others have said, don't eat before you go. There will be fresh salad, fish stew (made fresh with whatever comes in the net that morning!), fried fish, breads, desserts, fresh fruit, beer, wine, water, soda, etc. We left SO full and relaxed after a beautiful day. The only downside was the wind and clouds, but the fact that we had such an amazing time in spite of the cooler weather really speaks to what a great experience this is. It was, without a doubt, the highlight of our honeymoon. Thank you!!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anonimus96,July 2018,5,Amazing,"The best day my husband and I spent in Milos. Niko, his wife Frossa and the deckhand Simos are awesome people, we felt like part of the family as soon as we put our feet on the boat. Their hospitality is incredible! We left from the port of Pollonia and visited the islands of Poliegos and Kimolos and we’ve swum in that clear and beautiful water (it looked like a pool).  After this, we fished and then niko’s wife cooked the fresh fish. We had: fish soup, fried fish, salad, wine and bread. She also prepared some appetizers and a snack for the afternoon. They also have a big ice chest with water, Coca Cola, lemonade, orange juice, wine and a Greek liquor called “ouzo”.Far from the basic touristy things to do, this is a real Greek experience full of fun and laughs.If you come to Milos, you have to make a fishing experience with niko and his crew. It’s a must!! Carly and Nico. - [ ]"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/82colet,June 2018,5,Out on the sea in a fishing boat ,"This is my very first review, although having trip advisor for years.So you get the point...Our day out with Nikos and his crew was beyond anything I have ever expected it to be.There is so much that you can learn from him as he very well educated not just concerning being a fisherman or about the sea.The trip itself included fantastic food directly prepared after we got the catch onto the boat.In the first place the asked 80 Euro seemed to be a little steep, but what you get in exchange is absolutely worth the money.The trip lasted for 7 hours, the fish that we ate was already not too far away from 80€, all drinks (no matter what) were also included and available in MASSES.Anyway this trip will stay with me for the rest of my life!Cheers to you Captain Nikos!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anitabI8027FA,June 2018,5,Perfect day,"We go with Nikos, his wife Froso and Simon to the FishingTrip it was great ... best food fresh from the Ocean, very interesting to see the work of fishermen, speaking about living on milos and the traditions ... beautiful places for swimming! and looking!!! Snacks, fishsoup, baked fishes, greek  coffee, yoghurt with homemade sweets and watermelone, Drinks how much we want and a Ouzo before  leaving the boat!!! A very nice and  perfect day! Thanks so much Anita and Bernd.... a „must to do“ staying in Milos"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/985craigg,June 2018,5,"What an amazing day, thank you so much.","For years and years I’ve been visiting the Greek islands and have wanted to go out on a traditional fishing boat. When I saw this trip and read the reviews I knew I wanted to go and it didn’t disappoint. What an amazing day we had. Captain Nikos and his wife Frossa are such a lovely couple and helped by the hardworking Simos they gave us a day that we will never forget. I’ve never eaten so much fresh fish in my life. The fish soup was amazing. Fridge full of beers, wine, ouzo, soft drinks etc. All the food was great and the desert from Frossa was so good I wasn’t embarrassed to lick my plate. We were made to feel like family from the moment we stepped aboard. I can’t speak highly enough about this trip and Captain Nikos, what a great guy. Visited some beautiful locations along the way. I just wish I had time to go again. Hopefully next year. If you come to Milos you have to go on this trip, you won’t be disappointed. Thank you so much Nikos and Frossa."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/svschriner,June 2018,5,Highlight of our time in Milos,"Warning: do NOT eat before going on this tour! You will eat many delicious meals on this trip. The hosts went above and beyond to make you comfortable and had everything you need - water, soda food etc. I would highly recommend!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whiteape,June 2018,5,Lobster or sausages? You decide.,This was a fantastic trip we did with Nikos and Froso. We're dropped a net coming out of the bay and pulled it in with lobsters and lots of fish while we enjoyed the sight and had a couple of beers with feta and tomatoes on some crunchy bread. We then went for a swim while they cooked up a fantastic feast of lobsters salad and spaghetti with some local white wine. Next we did a spot of fishing from the boat with rods. Then onto the bluest water I've ever seen for a swim and snorkel. Then we had yogurt with some grape jam. Then a little siesta then back to the bay in the evening. Had some lovely chats with the folks on the boat and was made to feel very welcome. We also saw some of the other boat trips cooking sausages on the beach while we were eating our lobsters lol.All in all the best day we've had in Greece and really finished off our stay in Milos on a high.
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beatkinda,May 2018,5,One of the best days of our trip!!,"Thanks Froso and Captain Niko! We had a really lovely time as a group of four on the boat. Probably the day we talk about most -- wonderful hospitality, food, and swimming. We felt the love and dedication from our hosts and have never seen such blue water. They did almost all the fishing, so if you want to spend a day on a boat having good conversation and eating well and seeing some of Milos' hidden gems, this is the way to go. Can't thank you enough or rate you high enough!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venture41826,October 2017,5,The only way to discover the real Milos! ,"This made our European trip!Right at the end of the season, this lovely couple, Nikos and Froso welcomed us on board their fishing boat. Nikos (with 35years fishing experience!) and Froso (the amazing hostess) looked after us like we were part of their family. It was great to see the unique way they fish the sea and to see the island from a different perspective. We pulled in over 11 species of fish and ate at least 6 of them!Red snapper grilled with salad and Nikos's home made soup and the freshest most delicious broth you would ever try!  We were treated like royalty, fed like we had never eaten and drinks just kept on coming!!These other reviews do not lie. They are the most kindhearted people you will meet and love what they do and it shows.We can't thank you enough, we will be back! ευχαριστώ για τις εκπληκτικές αναμνήσειςLuke and Sarah "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2risttttt,September 2017,5,"best day in greece with them, authentic and very kind","Genuine, Authentic, we loved every moment in this day, felt like being part of a family. The best fish soup of our lives, no kidding. And the smile and kindness of these people is the only thing hotter than the sun. To see the nets and the fishes inside, was very interesting, we went to beautiful beaches, and had very nice food. You can sit comfortably on the boat, not like on other cruise boats . We were only 8 ppl, so that was awesome.  We hesitated to come back 1 day later. ....A lot of love in this boat..."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xaviernica,September 2017,5,Great fishing experience with net ,"Great fishing experience ... Nikos, the captain, and his wife Froso, will take you to beautiful places and you will eat the freshiest fish of your life. Believe me! Great time! We laughed a lot! A ""must"" if you are in Milos! Very familiar and genuine crew! "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/803sph,September 2017,5,Very nice day!!,"The temperature was awesome, the captain, his wife and his employee were very nice and were always proposing something to drink and to eat. We ate so many kind of fishes and it really worth it. We were only 3 customers on the boat so it was a very private tour. I recommend this activity to everyone!! "

We spent a day with Nikos and his company and we will never forget it. Tour around three islands, fishing, swimming, just perfect. It's not luxury, it's pure Cycladic and you will love it! "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TEE19,August 2017,5,I would do this again 😊👌,"This is a very nice thing to do while you are in Milos. Nikos, Frosco and their assistant will do anything to make you feel at home. I had  never been on a fishing trip before but I still think this was great! Highly recommended "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ismene_s2k,August 2017,5,A really great and unique experience!,I went with Captain Nick on one of his first trips and i experienced something totally different from what i lived so far. A great boat trip to some amazing beaches in Kimolos and Polyegos combined with real fishing during the trip. When you swim Nick and Froso are cooking the fish and then everybody is eating together an extremely delicious lunch. I totally recommend it!!!!
