0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nasa00,September 2020,5,Very nice trip,"Maria and Gerasimos are very warm and interesting people. There was plenty of fresh and delicious food, all made by Gerasimos. The beaches that we visited were beautiful and non-crowded. The sea was calm. We enjoyed our trip a lot and would definitely recommed it to others!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KENT_Gang,August 2020,5,The best of trips with super-friendly hosts. 100% recommended,"This was definitely the highlight of our wonderful fortnight in beautiful Kefalonia. We had the best of days; watching the fishing nets being recovered (and the myriad of different, and as we found out, tasty species), seeing the sea turtles around the fish farm, swimming and snorkelling at the White Cliffs beach and Vardiani Island (both only accessible by boat), and eating the finest of freshly caught and prepared food, all washed down with local wine and tsipouro. Maria and Captain Gerasimos were so friendly and welcoming, explaining how the food was prepared, and taking time to answer all of the questions we had about Kefalonian life. We also had the delights of Maria's very friendly young daughter to entertain us. We are a family of four including two adult, 18 and 20 year old daughters, who all thoroughly enjoyed our fabulous trip.‚Ä¶"

4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/136arner,August 2020,5,The best trip one can wish for,"This trip is the most pleasant combination of secluded beaches, amazing  seafood, great company and unforgettable fishing experience. Small group size allows guests to get to know true locals, the nicest people you can meet, Captain Gerasimos and the host Maria. Beautiful trip, authentic experience, oh and did I mention insanely fresh and tasty food?  In short, do yourself a favour and just book it.‚Ä¶"
