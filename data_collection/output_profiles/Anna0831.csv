Inspirational!,"26 of us cycled in Cambodia in extremely difficult global circumstances. Sokhom helped to make the experience absolutely amazing. His knowledge of History, Culture and religion knows no limits. No question was too difficult. Top this off with his amazing support team and entertaining humour and you couldn't ask for more. However you get it, his warm, generous, welcoming personality and love for his country shine through. We love you all Shokom xx.",Date of experience: March 2020,Kaleidoscope Guided Tours,4,"Siem Reap, Cambodia"
Wonderful Day,"My second time, my partner's first. Cannot recommend this experience enough. Remember it's not your ordinary excursion it's a a real fishing boat and that is what you are there to experience, which is what makes it so special. We both agree that we ate the best meal of our holiday on this boat.... Which considering the size of the kitchen is absolutely amazing. Antonia & Mikalis thank so much",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Perfect for us,"This is the second time that we have stayed at the annexe studios. They are immaculately clean, beautifully situated and with stunning views of the sea and /or the mountain. The pool over at the main building is lovely and Tonia and her family are wonderful. The area of Trapezaki is very quiet with lovely walks, a beautiful beach and really nice tavernas.",Date of stay: September 2017,Marina Anna Studios,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Wonderful beach,"Unspoilt, quiet, sandy beach. Benefits from the fact that there are only a limited number of of sunbeds and only at one side of the beach. Beautiful views with warm, clear waters. One taverna with excellent food (a little pricey, but worth it)",Date of experience: September 2017,Trapezaki Beach,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Consistently good,This is our second year in Trapezaki and we always find the food in Gefiri really good and the service friendly. I love the Cheese honey and sesame pie starter.,Date of visit: September 2017,Gefiri Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely place,"Lovely situation, excellent food and friendly service. The views are stunning, I can highly recommend the swordfish and the beef in red wine.",Date of visit: September 2017,Veramente Grill House,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Exquisite food,"Beautifully situated on the beach. Service is good and the food is exceptional. Prepare to pay more than usual, but you will certainly get value for money.",Date of visit: September 2017,Denis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Off the beaten track,Lovely food and stunning views. We always make the effort to wander down here at least once. Relaxed dining at its best,Date of visit: September 2017,Enastron,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Stunning,"Stunning food, stunning views, excellent service and lovely people. This was our second visit and we had an excellent meal. For various reasons we had some difficulty getting a taxi back to Trapezaki, we settled in for a wait quite happily, but the lovely owner decided that he would bring us back himself- service above and beyond!",Date of visit: September 2017,La Mer Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Unusual and Excellent Day,Thank you so much to Antonia and her family for a wonderful experience. A really different excursion. My 13 year old son enjoyed the day too. Antonia's preparation of the food was also exceptional,Date of experience: September 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Perfect,"I have just returned from a wonderful holiday with my 12 year old son. We stayed in the Annexe, the rooms are kept scrupulously clean. Tonia is an amazing hostess and cannot do enough for her guests, this included looking after me and taking me to the hospital when I was poorly (a blip in an otherwise perfect holiday in a stunning location). I don't drive abroad, but Tonia arranged for us to be collected for an excursion, we made use of the bus and walked to local beaches. I would say that it would be ideal to drive, but not doing so did not detract from our holiday.",Date of stay: July 2016,Marina Anna Studios,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Awesome (says my 12 year old son),"Food was perfect, wine excellent, views stunning. A very special evening, relaxed and unhurried. Happy to cater for everyone's taste",Date of visit: July 2016,La Mer Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best day of the holiday,"A day spent swimming at beaches which can't reach by land. Beautiful scenery, good food and good company. What more could we ask for? (My son is 12, but family with young children didn't seem appropriate)",Date of experience: July 2016,Kefalonia Trips QueenBee,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Excellent food and excellent customer Service,"We visited on a Friday evening, taking advantage of a 50% offer. However, I have based the review of value for money on the full menu price.",Date of visit: January 2016,The Red Lion,4,"Stockport, United Kingdom"
