Best Trip,"I had never fished before, but my boyfriend loves it so we thought we would give it a go.
I absolutely loved it. Vasilli was so helpful, patient haha and friendly.
He made sure we had drinks, knew what we were doing and that we had fun.
We caught 14 fish between us, swam in the ocean and ate one of the nicest meals.
If we wasn't leaving on Saturday, I would do it again!! So far my favourite experience on the island. You just can't fault this experience at all.
You have to give it a try!!",Date of experience: June 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
