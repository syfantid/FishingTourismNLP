From the moment we met them, to the time we left we were at ease and informed of everything. I fished, did nt catch anything to mention!! But then it was in the middle of the day and was nt really expecting to. We snorkelled, went to the warm springs and ate on the boat. Nick had caught a fish first thing in the morning which was lovely - as were the salads and accompaniments. To see the sunset from the boat is different and truly lovely.   The trip was not cheap, but I would suggest anyone took the trip.…"
