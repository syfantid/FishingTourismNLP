"Great staff, great food","I was working in the area for the week and spent most of my evenings here. All the staff were friendly and helpful. There’s a fun quiz on Sundays and a more serious one on Thursdays. Discounts on ale on Mondays and wine on Sunday evenings. They also mentioned a new menu coming next week.
This is a great pub, make sure you visit if you’re in the area.",Date of visit: October 2019,The Green Man,4,"Kenilworth, United Kingdom"
"Must visit, get a tour if poss","I love a ancient ruin site, this is one of my favourites. I have visited before, but wanted to go back.

You can buy a combined ticket for here and the museum for €16pp, valid for 48 hours (so you don’t have to do both on the same day if you don’t want to).

It is obviously very hot, very open and very busy. I would recommend a 3pm or later visit to avoid all 3. Take a tour if you can, all seem very knowledgeable and passionate about the site. Our guide, Maria was lovey and friendly, and clearly enjoyed telling us about the history.

Yes, much of this has had “some work done” by the archeologists who discovered it but that doesn’t take away from the interest or wonder of the history. The original mosaics are in the museum.

We haven’t used the cafe, but the toilets do have attendants. You don’t have to tip if you don’t want to, but if you do 50 cents is the “suggested donation”.

There are many souvenir shops / cafes outside. Don’t be fooled by the earlier signs for parking, these are taverns looking for you to stop with them. Parking is free and lots of space at the site.",Date of experience: September 2019,The Palace of Knossos,4,"Crete, Greece"
"Great site, could do with more info","Beautiful site, mostly original and great place for walking and looking at some real history. Unfortunately the only information about the site (that we could find) was in the few buildings by the entrance and a map. The tickets had a map on the back for you to find your way and know what you are looking at.

The gift shop and cafe were closed so take water with you. Toilets were satisfactory. I’m sure the staff would answer questions if you asked but there was nothing to read. If there was an opportunity for a guided tour, I would recommend this.

The site is lovely and not too busy when we went. Only the pots have been rebuilt. Good value for money overall. Good parking facilities. Closed on Mondays.",Date of experience: September 2019,Malia Palace Archaeological Site,4,"Crete, Greece"
Best restaurant in Agios!,"Having been to Agios in 2016 (when we discovered this little delight!) we returned again for the day on our holiday this year.

Previously we had eaten here 4-5 times, we headed straight back when it came to lunch time. As we chose our table and sat down, the manager came over and welcomed us - greeting with “long time, no see!” How amazing that this man remembered us, not just our faces but offered me the Mythos and olives, as if we had only visited last week!

The fish here is fresh and delicious but on this occasion we chose the Greek plate. This was great too!

The view from the seating is beautiful, over looking the beach and cove. Any unwanted bread goes over the fence and you can watch the fish in the sea come and eat it.

Welcoming and friendly staff, clean facilities, delicious food. You must spend some times here!
If / when we return, we will be again!",Date of visit: September 2019,Ofou To Lo,4,"Crete, Greece"
“Home away from home”,"Visited here for lunch, mainly based on the trip advisor reviews.

The staff are friendly, food and drink all good, sports tv, strongbow on tap. Toilets satisfactory.

Great place if you’re looking for something that resembles your local at home (with better cocktails) but not a traditional Greek restaurant - that’s not to say they don’t serve tasty Greek meals though.",Date of visit: September 2019,White Lion,4,"Crete, Greece"
Fab place! A must visit!,"After visiting here previously on a different holiday, we made a point of returning again because we enjoyed it so much before.

It’s €8 entrance (adults) and isn’t a massive place, please remember this is a charity and the people here do good work. There isn’t a cafe, toilets are basic and I didn’t notice a vending machine or anything so I would recommend you visit after breakfast or lunch.

First is the aquarium, with a number of different sea life creatures - not just lots and lots of all the same fish! I love this because the octopus and eels are actually moving, not just sitting in a corner. There are some big fish, small fish and even a turtle.

Moving on is the reptile section. There is always 2 or more members of staff around to talk to you about the animals. They encourage you to hold the snakes and lizards which is great fun! Mind your feet, so you don’t step on an iguana!

Great for kids and adults alike, well worth the entrance fee and a great cause as well!",Date of experience: September 2019,Aquaworld Aquarium & Reptile Rescue Centre,4,"Crete, Greece"
Lovely insight in old Cretan life,"Welcoming staff, offering help and information when asked. Short video presentation is available at specific times in a number of languages. Audio description offered extra for 2 Euro’s.

Easy to follow walk, lasting 1-2 hours. Refreshments and gifts available as well.

This was a really nice little place and I enjoyed it very much. Good value for money with many aspects of Cretan life explained.

Well worth a visit!",Date of experience: September 2019,Lychnostatis Open Air Museum,4,"Crete, Greece"
Crete Aquarium,"Nice aquarium which has parking just a 1 minute walk away. Great for anyone who likes fish, has children to entertain and / or looking for some time out of the sun.

There is a small coffee shop outside as well as the cafe inside, however we did not eat in either on our visit.

Next to most of the tanks is a “roller” where you select the language you require and it gives you the name of the fish.

There are a number of small interactive screens, such as guessing the shark jaws, fish skeletons in 3D and baby turtles on a projector. All good fun and giving you information. Obviously most of the fish information is in Greek.

The sharks and turtles are the highlight for most, but I liked the octopus, cuttlefish and jellyfish the best.

Free WiFi and satisfactory toilet facilities.",Date of experience: September 2019,Cretaquarium - Thalassocosmos,4,"Crete, Greece"
"Great staff, lovely food, nice location","We stayed at this hotel for 10 days. The hotel is spotlessly clean, nicely laid out with some beautiful views. The beach is literally a 10 second walk and you can hire towels to use at the pool or beach for a deposit.
There is a games room and entertainment every evening with additional things to do during the day - both for kids and adults.

The staff are really friendly and helpful. Everyone says hello, and want you have have a nice time. They can’t do enough for you, much more than I would expect for an all inclusive.

The food is lovely! Breakfast , lunch and dinner in the main restaurant is buffet style but if you need anything, just ask the staff and they are happy to help if they can. At breakfast you can have omelettes made to order (the chef here is really lovely, always says morning - he’s a big fella, don’t be put off, nothing a smile and manners doesn’t cure - he’s a big softy really!) Kostas, the restaurant manager welcomes you every time you visit, he’s welcoming and friendly, and works very hard. You can also book for the 3 restaurants (the day before) if you would prefer to have a menu to look at - I would recommend this as the restaurants are great (Asian, Italian and a Greek). The staff here are equally as great - especially Georgia and the chefs in the Italian.
Snacks, ice cream and drinks are available at the pool and hotel bars in between meal times.

You can hire a car from here (very reasonably), join a tour group/outing or catch a bus or mini train from outside.

There aren’t many bars, restaurants or clubs too close but a short walk along the sea front will find a few, plus shops and other hotels which let you join them in their restaurants and bars.
Please visit the souvenir shop just outside the hotel too. If you’re looking for gifts, wine or olives etc to take home, it is better priced than the ones on the sea front. The lady in the shop is also willing to give you advice, not just on her products but the local area as well.",Date of stay: September 2019,Serita Beach Hotel,4,"Crete, Greece"
"Great cocktails, great Andreas!","Found this place on a local mini train tour (see other reviews). The train stops a couple of units down and we were initially hooked by the 241 cocktails!
Andreas was welcoming and friendly and we subsequently visited a number of times during our time in Crete.
The cocktails were obviously delicious and great value for money.
Thank you for your hospitality!",Date of experience: September 2019,Havana Club,4,"Crete, Greece"
Nice lunch,Visited here with some friends that have moved to the area. Staff were all friendly and the food was tasty & good value. Would be happy to visit again next time we’re in the area,Date of visit: June 2018,"Peacock Lodge, Gatwick",4,"Lingfield, United Kingdom"
"Great new look, great food",Haven’t been here for ages but what a change since I last was! The new carvery was delicious and the staff were friendly. The pub looks great! The wacky warehouse has gone which is a bit sad but there is still an outside climbing frame so that kept the kids happy because it was a nice day. We’ll be going back again very soon,Date of visit: June 2018,"Myllet Arms, Greene King Pub & Carvery",4,"Greenford, United Kingdom"
Lunch meeting,Came here for a work meeting today. We had an area at the back of the pub and had a carvery as we talked work. I don’t usually go for a roast but this was really good! Definitely won’t mind next time the boss says to meet him here again & I might even take the Mrs at the weekend!,Date of visit: March 2018,Air Balloon,4,"Horley, United Kingdom"
Birthday bash,"I would like to thank all the staff at the fairway for a great night, me and me mates decided on going to the fairway as we often use the driving range there and the food is good. They had advertised a Brit pop band called dizzy fish on the Friday so the date was set. And what a great night the band was really good and the place was jumping, thanks again",Date of visit: February 2018,Fairway,4,"Ruislip, United Kingdom"
Expensive but worth the money,"This is a great zoo in beautiful surroundings. It is very big so make sure you wear your walking shoes. It cost £28 (adult) to get in which is a bit steep but is worth the money when you see the animals which are obviously very well cared for in their large enclosures. There is a train you can go on which is another £4.50, with commentary as you drive round and also a free bus service which you can jump on and off as you like.

When we went, it was out of season so a number of the food outlets were closed and the reptile house was having some work done so that was out too but this is to be expected really. The main cafe was open, food was good but again a bit expensive. Everywhere was very clean and cared for.

A great day, don't miss it!",Date of experience: September 2017,ZSL Whipsnade Zoo,4,"Dunstable, United Kingdom"
"Amazing museum, not to be missed","I love a good museum and this is one of the greats! The building itself is so beautiful and you could probably spend a day just looking at the intricacies of the architecture and decoration of the stone work.

You do need to have your bag searched on the way in but this is just a sign of the times and once you're in, it's not something you need to worry about again. (Personally I think it's a small price to pay to protect the safety of visitors and the priceless and historical exhibits)

We spent 5 hours here and still didn't get to see everything but I would be so happy to go again. There are some ""copied"" exhibits but this didn't bother me so much as everything is so carefully cared for and laid out. There is a fountain of knowledge on so many subjects, I would have got lost for days reading every snippet of information. The stuffed animals can make you feel a little uncomfortable but I'm guessing that's why some of them are models.

I have visited this museum previously as a child and remember it as a boring place with rooms full of bugs and stones on display but the improvements since then are amazing. Many of the displays are now interactive and some of the models move. They have clearly tried to make the museum more relevant and I believe they have achieved this while still remaining true to its roots.

We didn't eat here but that was only because we had planned to eat elsewhere in London, not because it was to expensive or the food was unappealing. The toilets were clean and had attendants. The staff were helpful and knowledgeable.

A great day, not to be missed!",Date of experience: September 2017,Natural History Museum,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Get a 241 voucher ...,"My partner and I were on a day out in London and had picked up a 241 voucher book when getting our train tickets. We had seen the Ghost Bus advertised before and the 241 voucher made us give it a go.

We found the meeting point but hadn't pre booked, we were able to just join up there and then. The guy sorting out the visitors out wasn't particularly welcoming but in fairness, wasn't rude either. The cost is £21 per person so the 241 voucher was a bonus.

We joined the bus and settled in a seat. On departure there was some historical information given but this soon became less of a focal point. Theatrics took over and in between the random bursts of interruption a short ghost story might turn up. It was humorous but sadly it was not exactly what we had in mind. The idea of a bus tour with horror stories is a great one but could have been operated better. The girls running the bus are following a script and played their part well enough but I personally would have preferred more historical stories.

The 241 voucher made this experience more acceptable, had I paid £42, I would have been less forgiving.",Date of experience: September 2017,The Ghost Bus Tours - London,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Walk Forrest Walk,"I've been wanting to eat at this restaurant for a while. I found a 241 voucher on main meals Ina train travel booklet so thought it was a good deal.

We were welcomed into the shop and restaurant warmly by the staff and shown to a table. At the time the place wasn't too full so could pretty much picked where we sat. There was a sign on the table, one side saying run Forrest run, the other with stop Forrest stop. It was pointed out to us that if we wanted service to have the stop side showing. Although a novel idea, a bit unnecessary really (it mostly made me feel like the staff didn't need to come over to us if the run sign was on show, but that's a personal view and I'm sure not all customers feel this way and like the gimmick)

We ordered some cocktails and on their arrival, ordered our meals. The drinks were tasty but not overly alcoholic and quite expensive for what they were but then I am aware we were in the heart of London. The food however was very good. I love prawns so was spoilt for choice. The starters were delivered quickly and the mains shortly after we had had finished, we didn't have to wait much at all.

The best thing about this restaurant is the food. It was very clean (tables and toilets) and the staff were friendly enough. It was an expensive meal but the 241 voucher was a bonus. Look out for the 12.5% service charge that's already been added to your bill for you. We paid it, but didn't leave any additional tip because of it.",Date of visit: September 2017,Bubba Gump Shrimp Co,4,"London, United Kingdom"
"So welcoming, delicious food, beautiful hotel, worth every penny","This hotel is situated just outside the pretty town of Brantome. It is close enough to walk to but not in uncomfortable shoes because it is a good 20-25 min walk away.

On arrival we were greeted so warmly by a gentleman that we later discovered was the father in this excellent family run hotel. He apologised that he didn't speak much English but between him and my other half we worked out (with much laughing at everyone's hand gestures) that we had arrived too early to check in but his son would be back at 4 and if we would like to visit the town for a few hours we could leave the car and come back later. This suited us as we were hungry after traveling early from home and we were given a map by the matriarchal mother who was also very warm and friendly. As we set off up the white chalk road towards the village, the lady of the house pulled up and offered us a lift as she was heading that way to. During the car journey she told us to eat by the river but avoid the market area because the food wasn't as good.

We had our lunch and made the trek back. On returning we met the son who also welcomed us very warmly and asked if we would be eating dinner with them, which we accepted. Our room was beautifully decorated, very clean and had a small balcony looking out over the mill and river.

We were visiting this area for a wedding the next day and the lady of the house generously offered to iron my shirts, which was such a great help, I had been worried about how they would look after being in a suit case for 12 hours.
We handed the shirts in just before dinner and they were back in the wardrobe, professionally pressed (much better than either of us could have achieved) before we had dessert!

The meal we had was nothing short of amazing! On the menu was the choice of 2 set menus that you selected from or individual dishes, each individually priced. We chose 1 set menu for €48 and another from €65. We were spoiled for choice with a number of delicious meals we could have selected, we decided upon starters of crayfish and lobster, mains of sea bass and a fillet of beef and for dessert apple tart and a chocolate melt in the middle. All of these were so fantastic! We had canapés first, the lobster starter was so beautiful, I could have eaten it twice or more! The sea bass was so good, fillet of beef probably the best we have every had (& we have had some amazing beef in the past) the desserts looked like a work of art and both so delicious. I can not recommend the food enough, if you stay there, you have to have dinner even if it's just once. I swear you won't regret it! The whole time, we were looked after by a gentleman maitre d. Upon returning to our room, which over looked the restaurant entrance we saw the father in the kitchen, dressed in his chef blacks! We were blown away! This little firecracker of a man, so much amazing skill! He also cooked the eggs for breakfast and we took the chance to congratulate him on his amazing food!
Breakfast consisted of a fresh fruit salad, natural yogurt, pancake, breads and a number of French pastries with jam and a choice of eggs with orange juice (freshly squeezed) with tea and coffee. Again, all delicious.

The shower in the room was great (not wishy washy) the bed was comfortable and soft. A great nights sleep was had by both of us and the gentle swishing of the water outside was not intrusive. There is a great collection of chickens all over the hotel, these quirky little ornaments gave the place character and we loved looking around to see them in little corners.

On check out we were given a gift from the hotel owners, and they genuinely wished us well. If we were to return to this part of France, we would definitely make a point of staying there again. Beautiful hotel, lovely people, amazing experience!

(I apologise that we didn't actually catch anyone's name during the entire time we were here. I wish we had because everyone we met were such warm and genuine people who clearly love their jobs and deserve to be recognised by name)",Date of stay: September 2017,Le Moulin De Vigonac,4,"Brantome en Perigord City, France"
Best Chiquito in the area,"Chiquito is a chain outlet and I have been to a number of them in my surrounding areas however this is by far the best one. The food is always good, it's clean, 9 times out of 10 the servers are friendly and helpful and they do the best cocktails. We went here for my girlfriends birthday and we all had a great time. We visit here regularly and always have a great meal.",Date of visit: September 2017,Chiquito,4,"Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom"
"Steep steps, great views, lovely little bar",This was a lovely place to visit. The clock tower looks beautiful from the outside. The €5 entry cost includes a drink at the cute little court yard bar too (beer & spirits included). The steps up the tower are enough to puff you out a bit but the views are worth it once you catch your breath. Definitely worth a little stop.,Date of experience: June 2017,Roloi Clock Tower,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Grigoris made our visit! You must try his cocktails!,"We booked this hotel through a popular holiday website. We liked the fact it was directly on a beach, close to Rhodes main town but not right in the centre of the hub-bub. We only ever book for B&B because we like to go out and try different restaurants to eat so all inclusive wasn't what we were specifically looking for. We paid extra to have a sea view.

On arrival we were greeted by a friendly member of staff at the main reception who checked us in and gave us a welcome pack. The room was more of a suite with bedroom, bathroom and a ""living room"" with small kitchen area with its own microwave, kettle, fridge, toaster, coffee machine and sink. It also had its own spacious balcony. We were obviously very happy with this as we did not expect such a large room for just 2 of us. The view was exactly what we paid for, it was a beautiful sight and also over looked the pool area. We could hear the music from that area but it wasn't overly loud but closing the balcony door stopped us from hearing it, if we were bothered. The wifi did drop out occasionally but not enough to be an inconvenience. The room was cleaned daily to a high standard. The safe in the room was free of charge to use.

After settling in, we made our way down stairs to the hotel bar to find some dinner. We arrived about 8:30/9pm so didn't fancy wandering out on this particular night as we were tired from travelling. As previously mentioned, we didn't opt for all inclusive so the bar we went to was very quiet. All the Guests enjoying the all inclusive deals were in the other restaurant so we had the Dyanises Bar (definitely spelt wrong, sorry) pretty much all to ourselves. We couldn't help but think this beautiful pool side bar should have more customers than just us so if the hotel were to put some entertainment on or TVs in here, there would maybe some more people. However, on this evening we were greeted by Grigoris the barman. He was very welcoming and chatted to us as he made our drinks and we ordered food. The drinks he made for us were delicious and the food was absolutely great, possibly the best meal we had all week!

Breakfast is buffet style with many different items to choose from. The morning staff were also welcoming and helpful, and we saw Greg working here too. The little guy making fresh omelettes was always cheerful and happy to accommodate requests. Sadly the orange juice wasn't fresh but there was plenty of fruit available.

The beach the hotel is situated is a bit rough to swim in and very stoney, although this is obviously not the hotels fault. However, it is a wind surfers dream and the mini market across the road sells swimming shoes (run by a friendly Australian Guy).

The hotel is near various restaurants, all within walking distance. Everyone we met was friendly and welcoming and trip advisor was helpful when choosing where we were going to eat each day. We would recommend trying the food in the hotel bar but Pezouli or Kostas Village Taverna for Greek food were both really great. You can catch a bus into Rhodes for €2.30 each just a 10 minute walk from the hotel, but all the buses are very busy and it can be a fight to get on. A taxi into the town centre will cost €13 but be aware if you call a cab to pick you up, it will be €16 instead. The hotel staff are happy to give you maps or call the taxi for you. You can also hire a car from the guy in the reception area. Again, always says hi and was very reasonable with his prices. The hotel also has a lovely lady who can help you book excursions and visits to the tourist sites at a very reasonable rate too.

Although we did not have any children with us, we did see some kids entertainment going on. By all accounts the parents were very happy with this and we did notice activities going on everyday. In fairness it made no odds to us but it is worth noting this is a family friendly hotel so the pool was busy from 10am until about 6pm and there are obviously lots of kids about. We did see a gym and a beauty salon on the premises too. Other travellers have noted the aircraft flying over head but we didn't really notice this. If you were out on the balcony, you would notice it but the hotel can't do anything about this. It doesn't happen late at night or early morning so we found it no bother. The Mosquitos were more annoying than the planes, but again the store across the road had the solution for this too.

Although not big drinkers at home, the Mrs became quite partial to cocktails on our visit to Sun Beach. Greg's cocktail were great, over the week he could make anything we asked for and never had to look anything up or go to find ingredients. (In fact other staff members went to find him if we ordered anything with them). Over the week we were there, we saw Grigoris every day and he was always friendly, welcoming and chatty. He even recommended an authentic restaurant in Rhodes town, which was great and we actually felt a little sad to say goodbye to him. This guy made our week during our stay, he seemed to be working all the time and in the heat, that must be very difficult. I hope the owners of this hotel know what great staff they have, I hope other Guests appreciate the hard work he puts in to their stay and if I ever own a hotel, I'll be offering him a job!",Date of stay: June 2017,Sun Beach Resort Complex,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
"Great food, good service","Me & the better half went here for dinner a few nights ago. After reading some of the other reviews, we expected good food but a little less on the service front. However, we were pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome and attentive staff we found. The food was indeed very good too, the Meze starter plate was particularly good and we also tried the baked feta which had a nice fiery kick on it. There was a bit of a wait between the starter and main (about 30 minutes) but that could have been because the restaurant did fill up with other customers during that time. A free apple and cinnamon dessert is served when you ask for the bill along with the usual after dinner shot. This is a really pleasant place to have a meal, the service was good and the staff seemed to be happy and not bothered by any questions. Would gladly eat here again.",Date of visit: June 2017,Pezouli Greek Restaurant,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
"Bang on! (so much so, I feel sorry for the individual restaurants!)","My other half and I went here for dinner and have since been back for lunch. We usually try to go to local restaurants that offer an authentic atmosphere of the place we are on holiday, with local dishes and ingredients but on this particular evening, I chose here because the trip advisor reviews were all so good and the place looked lively compared to some of the other restaurants we had passed. On the walk in we were greeted by about 4 members of staff (including a chef), all happy and cheerful. Once seated we were given a menu, which was not only packed full of a wide range of meals but many many drinks. Yes, they are catering for the holiday makers looking for a good drink and a taste of home but they also had classic Greek meals and the steak I had was perfectly cooked. To me, this looks like a chain pub, the menus are professionally printed and the staff have clearly had some good training. We did partake in a few of the cocktails (with a list like this, it would be rude not to) and every one tasted delicious. This place has got the service pinned down and everything we have tasted has been lovely. I feel sorry for the restaurant across the road from them having to compete with this, his karaoke and chalk boards are not going to beat this pub. There are about 20 screens to be able to watch any European tv you want with pool tables and ping-pong tables out the back. I liked this place so much, it made me wish I hadn't found it.",Date of visit: June 2017,Alkionis Sports Bar & Grill,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Lunch by the beach,"Stopped here for lunch one afternoon whilst on a walk up the beach. It is literally on the beach so the view of the sea is great. It obviously has its own sun loungers so customers can spend more time there and have a waiter service, although this is not what we did. On entering we were welcomed by a little fella who seemed to be doing all the running himself. He gave us menus and then scooted off to deliver some food to another table. He came back to take our order and then returned with our drinks. He was a nice chirpy guy, smiling all the time (I wish I'd got his name). After a while another member of staff appeared but she didn't seem so happy to be there. The food was very good, portion size was generous for the price. The drinks we ordered were also good. The lady behind the bar was friendly too. Would happily return to this place again.",Date of visit: June 2017,Costa Mare,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Lovely place,"Went here for dinner whilst on holiday. All the staff were really friendly, with everyone you pass saying hello and goodbye. (Even the manager seemed pleased to see us and interested in our visit, which can sometimes be lost in some places). The food was good, with a wide range of Greek dishes to choose from. Mussels saganaki was delicious but did have a few closed ones, about 4 out of 12-15. The prices were very reasonable. Their cocktails were also very tasty. Lovely place, wouldn't hesitate to visit again.",Date of visit: June 2017,Kostas Village Taverna Ialyssos,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
"Good for wind surfing, not so good for swimmers","Pictures of the beach are lovely but swimming here is not overly relaxing. The beach is all stones (the painful kind) and the sea is rough. However, wind surfing is the thing here and seemed very popular.",Date of experience: June 2017,Ialysos beach,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Fabulous day out,"My other half booked this for us and to be honest I was a bit sceptical before the outing. It cost €100 for both of us which seemed expensive to me for a 9am-1pm trip out. However, I think this could be the high light of our trip to Rhodes. The girl at the harbour was very friendly and chatted to the Mrs (even though she has already decided we were going). On the day of the trip, she remembered us and promised we would have a great time. Once on the boat the Captain welcomed us and him and his ships help, Mikey were both in good spirits. There were only 5 Guests on his boat for our trip but he didn't seemed bothered by this at all. We drove out the harbour and could take photos of some of the scenery. We fished for a few hours and although I doubt anyone will ever catch anything more than a few inches long, it was great fun. We were offered drinks (included in the price) and looked after by the 2 gents, explaining which fish had spines etc. After about 2 & half hours (which flew by) we went in closer to shore to swim in the calm sea. My Mrs got changed for this below deck, although this was not totally private, the other men on the boat were respectful and stayed away from where she was. If she had been bothered by this, she wouldn't have been comfortable doing it. While we were swimming the Captain prepared lunch for us, possibly the best fish we have eaten this holiday, and a Greek salad followed by melon. And of course, more beer. This was a really great day, I would recommend it to anyone. So much fun.",Date of experience: June 2017,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Beautiful but needs more info,"This is a beautiful place and definitely worth a visit. A lot of this is reconstruction but has been done very well. Many of the exhibits have no information, it would be better if you knew more about what you were looking at, but saying that, the staff we spoke to all knew their stuff and could answer any questions we had.",Date of experience: June 2017,Palace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Full of history,"Visited during a holiday to Rhodes. A group ticket for this attraction as well as others in the town is only €10 which I thought was great value. The museum is full of exhibits, many have information plaques but not all. The staff here were ok, not friendly but not rude if you know what I mean. We didn't visit the cafe though. The art work on show is beautiful and very well looked after. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit.",Date of experience: June 2017,Archaeological Museum of Rhodes (Hospital of the Knights),4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great place but could be amazing,"I was so looking forward to visiting the medieval city. I love history and this sounded so amazing. To certain extent, it was. The small streets, with little courtyards here and there were great. The mote around the outside is not to be taken lightly in the heat of the day as there is no where to buy water once you're in. The museum and palace in this area were both interesting to visit. The main thing that lets this area down is the relentless ""hosts"" at every single restaurant or cafe you walk past. Although I'm sure they don't mean to be so off putting, they are and on the verge of aggressive at times. Watch out when ordering a beer, asking for a medium will get you at least 2 pints in a boot and cost €12. After experiencing this the first time, we were prepared the 2nd day and so it wasn't so bad.",Date of experience: June 2017,Medieval City,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
"Great little hidden gem, friendly staff, lovely drinks","We heard about this place from another couple. After a hot morning wandering around the old town, we googled Socratous Garden and set off and discovered it 1 road over from the Street of the Knights. The staff were all very friendly and welcoming, with no one trying to drag you in from the street. The trees and fountains made it feel like you weren't in the city at all, it was cool in the shade and the heat not so stifling. We ordered cocktails and a sandwich, all of which were delicious. The prices were very reasonable considering you were in the heart of the tourist area. Will definitely go back when we are in the City again.",Date of experience: June 2017,Socratous Garden,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Amazing but walk the walk 1st,"This was a really great place to visit. I love all the history stuff so this was at the top of my list for the island of Rhodes. We weren't staying in the area so had hired a car to get there. We were offered a number of different excursions to Lindos but many of the reviews we saw said you had a limited time and we wanted to set our own pace.
As we drove round a mountain, we saw a layby and pulled over to get some great photos.
On arrival we found there was a free car park, just before you drive into the village. (We saw no other car parks but saw signs about not parking in the main entrance) You do have to walk down the hill but there is a shuttle service. Once you get into the village, you are at the bottom of another mountain. Be prepared to walk up the other side to get to the Acropolis, it is steep and some parts are slippery because of the amount of footfall. There are donkeys that can take you up there for a fee but it is a bit unfair to expect a donkey to carry a full grown man up a steep hill if you ask me.
At the entrance, it's €12 to get in. There are vending machines to get refreshments and we saw signs for a cafe but didn't actually see it. There is still more climbing to do, both on stairs and rocks.
There is signage explaining what you are looking at, the Acropolis itself is in good condition (although some of it clearly restored but that's not the worst thing ever). There were also some staff around, but we did not need to ask them anything. The views from the top are amazing. To me it was definitely worth the climb up the mountain, this beautiful monument is a must see!",Date of experience: June 2017,Acropolis of Lindos,4,"Rhodes, Greece"

The village itself is very beautiful and it's easy to get lost in the maze of little ally ways. There are many shops and restaurants to be found, all the locals are friendly with not too much touting going on. (The donkey men can be a bit in your face though). We didn't go down to the beach but it did look like a lovely calm place to go for a cooling swim. Overall, this was a great place to visit. Between the village, beach and Acropolis, you could easily loose a whole day and not regret a minute.",Date of experience: June 2017,Village of Lindos,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Lads golf day and comedy night,"It's not very often you and your mates get the opportunity to enjoy your favourite pastimes all in one venue. My mate organised a golf day at Ruislip golf course and also suggested an evenings entertainment at the Fairway pub that's within the grounds of the golf course. The fairway host's comedian's upstairs, the headline was Andy parsons so we all agreed it was a good idea, so the lads day out was arranged. The mornings golf was the usual laugh (as none of us are any good). We had a few hours to kill before the doors opened to the comedy bunker so decided to grab some food in the restaurant of the fairway. The staff were great very friendly and helpful which makes a change to my local, the food was lovely well worth the money! Few more beers and then up stairs. What a great night and would recommend an evening here, great pub will be coming back.",Date of visit: September 2016,Fairway,4,"Ruislip, United Kingdom"
Christmas market adventure,"Lovely hotel very modern and clean, friendly helpful staff. The hotel is aimed at wine enthusiasts who would love there large varied selection, not my cup of tea but they also sell a great beer so all good Continental breakfast only which was fine but no real menu for evening which was ok for us as we eat out. It was very quiet though to quiet for us but I think that Vienna in general. Would recommend staying here for short stay trips as it's close to all attractions.",Date of stay: November 2016,Hotel Rathaus Wein & Design,4,"Vienna, Austria"
