HOLIDAY AT TRAPEZAKI BAY HOTEL FROM 25 SEPT TO 2 OCT 2019,"WOW, what can we say! We have just had an amazing week stay at the Trapezaki Bay Hotel. The staff were wonderful and helpful, we cannot fault them or the hotel.

Our room and the hotel was spotless. The staff could not do enough for us and we were treated like we were family and visiting their home. This is the best hotel we have ever stayed at for hospitality.

From our room we had great views of the sea and mountains.

This hotel is a must if you are travelling to Kefalonia and we will definitely be going back. Also everybody staying at the hotel at the same time as us that we spoke to are planning a return trip, which speaks volumes.

Thank you Nikos, Sofia, Maria and the rest of the staff for making our holiday a wonderful experience. See you soon.",Date of stay: September 2019,Trapezaki Bay Hotel,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
FISHING TRIP WITH ANTONIA AND MICHALIS ON 30 SEPTEMBER 2019,"We had a fabulous day with Antonia and Michalis on Monday 30 September 2019.

We were picked up by Antonia and taken to the boat early in the morning. When everyone had arrived, there were 11 of us, we were served coffee and homemade cake which was lovely. We then set sail for the nets. When the nets were being pulled up the men on board enjoyed helping taking the fish from the nets. We were then taken to a beautiful cove where you could only get to by boat. While we snorkelled Antonia prepared a magnificent lunch. The wine was made from their own grapes and the olive oil from their own olive trees which tasted superb.

We met some lovely people on the trip from Italy, Holland and the UK who made the trip memorable.

We cannot fault the trip even though I am not normally a boat lover! Antonia and Michalis were wonderful hosts and we will definitely go again when we return to Kefalonia! Hopefully next year :)",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Coasteering with Kernow Coasteering,"My 19 year old son and his 18 year old friend had a great time coasteering with Kernow. Great communication from Matt during the booking process. They had been coasteering before but said this one was far superior, big jumps, going in caves etc. Would highly recommend.",Date of experience: June 2018,Kernow Coasteering,4,"Penzance, United Kingdom"
30th Wedding Anniversary Stay,"We stayed at the Titanic Hotel Belfast last week for two nights. What an amazing hotel, room was spotless, food fab (we actually only ate there because of it). Most importantly the staff were amazing, so friendly and helpful, especially Philip who worked in the bar/restaurant. He could not do enough for us and was always smiling! Jerry, the Concierge also was very helpful. The hotel had lots of photos and information about the Titanic in the rooms and hallways, which was great as I love any information about the ship. For instance, the bar was originally the Harland & Woolf drawing room where the Titanic was designed. Would definitely go back and would recommend to anyone visiting Belfast.",Date of stay: April 2018,Titanic Hotel Belfast,4,"Belfast, United Kingdom"
