Boat trip with Dimitris,"We had a blast with Dimitris! Spent a full day on his boat traveling from one amazing beach to another. Dimitris spoiled us with food and drinks and taught us about the area and sea life. Our kids (7 and 10) had a joy and loved it so much that we ""had"" to book another day with Dimitris!
During the trip I lost my wedding ring in the sea and a day later Dimitris went back to that place and found it which was insane.. I have no idea how he managed to do it and it just shows what a great guy he is and how much he cares! I highly recommend this boat trip!",Date of experience: October 2020,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
