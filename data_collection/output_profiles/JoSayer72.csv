Best Boat Trip EVER,"We have been on several boat trips over the years (lazy days at sea) but never a fishing trip and this trip beats all the rest by far. My husband and I went on this trip with our 7 year old son and although none of us have fished before, we caught around 20 fish between the 3 of us. This is not a trip with lots of people, there were only 8 of us in total, and Giannis, Nancy and their daughter Areti took care of everyone and made it such an amazing day. Giannis taught us how to fish and Nancy is the most phenomenal cook, (the shrimp spaghetti is to die for), and they are the most genuine and lovely family you could wish to meet. Giannis also taught the boys (there was also another boy of around 12 years old) how to clean and gut the fish. There was beer and soft drinks that you could help yourself to and excellent wine with lunch.

We stopped at a beautiful bay to swim where the water is crystal clear and that is only used by a few locals as it is only reached by boat or by a hike down the mountain, so there were only around 10 other people around.

This is by far the best trip you will find in Samos with the most beautiful people who genuinely love the company of their guests and who soon turn into friends.

All the best with your business and keep in touch. xxx",Date of experience: August 2019,Samos Fishing Trips,5,"Samos, Greece"
