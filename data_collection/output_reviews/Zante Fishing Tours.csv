1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fitzyit,September 2019,5,Read the reviews then just book it.,"Booked our trip from the UK and everything was very easy. Our original trip was cancelled due to adverse weather so Giorgos (captain) tried to fit us in at a later date. Called that morning saying he would have to cancel again due to weather. Rang me back about 2 hours saying although we were about 3 hours late  would we still like to go but on a condensed trip as Giorgos did not want to let us down. We all agreed to go. Giorgos said the trip would not be as long as normal but we would get a feeling of what normally happened. So glad we went, the best day of our holiday. The boat is absolutely spotless. After coffee Giorgos explained what we would do and explained all about fishing. So interesting and informative. We put nets out and went to an island with no one on it for swimming etc. Went back to collect nets, hoping we would get some fish, which we did. More swimming at a different beach while lunch was prepared.  Food was excellent and so tasty and also very plentiful. All in all an excellent day we all agreed that if we return we would do it again but hope to get the full day in.  Can not recommend this trip enough, all crew and facilities first class.‚Ä¶"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aliyajd,August 2019,5,Amazing,This was by far the best day of our holiday. It was a great learning experience and lots of fun. The boat was clean and beautiful and they paid attention to detail using beautiful hand made plates instead of plastic.. the fish we caught was well cooked and delicious.. all in all a fantastic day. Thank you Giorgos!‚Ä¶

We all had a go at putting the nets out about 1500 metres , then over to a private island for a swim to shore , drinks in Porta Roma which is beautiful. Kids had a go on a speedboat inflatable ride which they loved! Then lunch on board the boat which was delicious, best day of our holiday, only Georgios has the licence to do this type of trip , was brilliant day! Thanks Georgios ‚Ä¶"
