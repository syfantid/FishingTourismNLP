Hidden gem,"Incredible home cooked food of an exceptional standard. A credit to the cook and her husband who makes everyone feel so welcome. For them it isn’t about making money, it’s about making people happy with their offering, top marks.",Date of visit: June 2019,Konoba Luviji,1,"Hvar Island, Croatia"
Quite simply incredible,"I have eaten in many places around the world and often been met with false claims of locally caught, freshly made etc. but this place truly doesn’t disappoint on the claims it makes. The locally pressed olive oil and salt collect from the local beach, set off your meal as you dip in the freshly made bread into the oil and sprinkle with a few crystals of salt. Then you can watch as your fish is cooked on the griddle alongside freshly caught squid and all washed down with home made lemonade. It is great value and simply delicious with genuinely warm and helpful service.",Date of visit: June 2019,MS Bar and Restaurant,1,"Mljet Island, Croatia"
"Warm welcome, good food","Entered the pub just as they opened, so wasnt expecting such a warm welcome and an excellent lunch. Great value and set us up for the afternoon walk in the moor.",Date of visit: May 2019,The Mary Tavy Inn,1,"Tavistock, United Kingdom"
Complete rip off,"Arrived at the park as a couple looking for a walk with the dig, ti be told it wss 10.90 per persin plus 4 for the dig. During the walk we came acrosd public footpaths, so we could have parked on the road and used these free of charge. The dog wasnt allowed in the cafe. Rip off, not suitable for those lookibg for a stroll. Children under 2 free but digs charged, bizarre.",Date of experience: April 2019,River Dart Country Park,1,"Ashburton, United Kingdom"
"lovely stay, great facilities","Had a last minute weekend stay due to the gorgeous weather. Site is set in the Pentewan Valley, so well located for visiting the rest of Cornwall. The weather obviously made a difference but what surprised us was the facilities for such a site, great pool and bar area The food was good and the beer from the bar sublime, very clean and crisp.",Date of stay: June 2018,Sun Valley Holiday Park,1,"St Austell, United Kingdom"
Great food,"Freshly made pasta and pizzas, eaten on a small back street made this a truly exceptional meal. Good value, great service and fresh ingredients.",Date of visit: June 2018,Maria's Pizza,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Do NOT stay here,"I have travelled many places and always been fair with my reviews. We booked this place for a one night stay as our last stop. It was relatively cheap but not the cheapest and we didn't expect much over and above a cleanliness and a modicum of comfort. It was filthy, the toilet bin had soiled paper still in it, the bathroom riddled with dirt and grime, the bed sheets full of stains. It is centrally located so you expect some street noise but the noise from the corridors of the reception managers dog barking at 3am was unacceptable. I can tolerate most places but I'd rather have stayed on a park bench.",Date of stay: June 2018,Pansion Angela,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Perfect location,"The welcome is so warm and genuine, you really cant expect more for the price. The apartments clean and spacious with views out to sea and just a walk down the steps before being in the port. Yes they are a little bit piecemeal in the way the are put together, tv very small and placed amongst unlevel switches on the walls but hey who wants tv on such a quaint island. Comfortable, clean and affordable would recommend to anyone on a budget.",Date of stay: June 2018,Maria Studios,1,"Alonnisos, Greece"
Great location matched by hospitality,Madam Matoula takes pride in her property and treated us as family members. Wonderful location just 100 yards from the port but secluded enough to feel like you are in a quiet countryside house. Very clean and great value. Pergect for couples. Highly recommend.,Date of stay: June 2018,Pansion Matoula,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Great night out,"Booked a 4 hour evening trip (6-10) with Demetris. Short twenty minute trip begore we are fishing. Caught plenty of small fish whilst being supplied with food and drink. Not fir the serious angler looking for bugh fush but perfect for the novice or youngsters lookibg to feel the tug of fish in their line. Took fish we caught to a local taverna who cooked them up for us the following evening, for a minimal fee. Trip back in in the dark was great.",Date of experience: June 2018,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Oh dear oh dear,"Went for a walk along the coast path and bumped into this little cafe. Was surprised at the cost of a crab sandwich (10.40) but indulged anyway. Stood at the take out hatch and had to propmt a young lady to take my order, just put this down to youth and inexperience. Order was simple, one crab sandwich but had to repreat this three times! Waited 20 minutes and when finally presented in a polystyrene box had no semblance of empathy from the same young lady, for my long wait. During the wait I had the chance to see the other staff in action, All the same I'm afraid, clueless in the aspect of customer service. Not their fault, I suspect cost saving by the proprietor and lack of training. The sandwich? OK but no value added from the establishment and let down both the cheap, eco unfriendly packaging and poor service. Probably good value at 5-6 pound, a rip off at 10+",Date of visit: May 2018,Porthmellin Cafe,1,"Helston, United Kingdom"
"Great value, clean and friendly","On arrival was greeted by a genuine and friendly receptionist, who quickly checked us in and directed us to a clean and spacious room. Half board included a very substantial breakfast and freshly cooked and amazing variety for dinner. The entertainment wasnt our thing and a quick glance revealed why? No complaints, thank you",Date of stay: May 2018,Hotel Roc Gran Camp de Mar,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Superb,I have visited many restaurants all around the world and can honestly say this is some of the tastiest Asian meals I have ever tasted. Matched with a genuine and warm welcome this is a must visit.,Date of visit: March 2018,Bonoo Indian Tapas,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Must see,"OMG, put it on your bucket list of places to visit. Very little shade but that adds to the charm in that it is untouched and like no other place globally. A small van provides limited snacks, so take your own lunch and if you want shade you may be bale to locate yourself in a vacant cave!!! We went by bus but taxis are available and walking is possible if not too hot. Buses run from Adamas but only infrequently, so check the timetable.",Date of experience: June 2017,Sarakiniko Beach,1,"Milos, Greece"
Uninformed Change,"Would love to write a good review about this place and was looking forward to staying here. Unfortunately when our group arrived at the airport we were taken to a place 6km away and on arrival advised that our original booking at Edem had been changed. No one at Edem previously advised of this and whilst the new accommodation was adequate and the views spectacular, it was in the middle of nowhere. This caused us extra expense in arranging taxis and sleepless nights as it was located above Super Paradise party beach!! The other group we were due to link up with in Platis Yialos were also disappointed as it meant a complete disruption to all our plans. Appreciate fully that sometimes these things happen but someone could have told us before we arrived at this new destination. One of the rooms in the new destination also thought it ok for one of our party to make do with a camp bed!!! Our message to Edem is very clear, keep people informed and if your are going to have to transfer them ensure they they are within the near vicinity to the original booking!!",Date of stay: June 2017,Edem Garden Residence,1,"Sifnos, Greece"
Wonderful apartments,"The apartments are located just 80 metres away from a small beach and just 200 metres from the main port, which is where everything you need is located. Clean, sizeable, aircon, cooking facilities and greats showers, you really can't ask for more form a great value room. Beds are comfortable and cleaned daily. If you just want to watch the world go by without it being too busy, just take a seat outside with a coffee beer or glass and wine and just chill as the sun goes down. Highly recommend.",Date of stay: June 2017,Kalliopi Apartments,1,"Milos, Greece"
Must see,"Bite the bullet, spend the 55 or so euros and book a boat trip from the main port of Adamas. You will be out all day on a sailing boat (winds have to be right for sails to be used) and make various stops that all have their own unique beauty. Snacks, lunch and plenty of water are provided, with limited alcoholic drinks if that's your fancy. As you go around the coast you will be amazed at all the different rock formations and crystal waters. When arriving at Kleftiko, you will be breathless at its beauty and uniqueness and all from the luxury of a yacht!! Worth every penny. You will be offered to option from the port of shorter trips at lower prices but these tend to be on boats with 30 or more passengers and offer little other than a direct trip, a quick dip and then a return. spend a bit extra and book a boat with limited numbers, it will have your own informative guide and the opportunity to explore through the caves on a small rib.",Date of experience: June 2017,Kleftiko Beach,1,"Milos, Greece"
"Great location, excellent value","Wasnt expecting too much for the money but was amazed at the cleanliness, hospitality and location. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to be located in the town area of the island (which is far more natural and much better than agia marina).",Date of stay: September 2016,Aegina Hotel,1,"Aegina, Greece"
"great beach, safe and quiet and excellent tavern","Visited many beaches on the island, found this to be the best in term of location, quietness and facilities",Date of experience: September 2016,Marathonas Beach,1,"Aegina, Greece"
Try hard but fall short,"Maybe it was an off night but not quite sure what the other reviewers have been visiting. The staff are very friendly and try ever so hard but not sure that they quite get it. Had to pre order meals before arriving, I assumed this would be because they would be busy but far from it. Then assumed it would be because the food would be quick, far from it. Sat for an hour before seeing any sign of bread or even being asked if we would like some nibbles. The seafood platter has elements that are gorgeous and high quality, like the squid and gravlax BUT the fish goujons are way over cooked and very dry, as was my friend fish and chips. I kind of think they are caught between trying to be a relatively classy establishment and a cafe (understandable) and perhaps my expectations were too high. There are elements of quality and chic, with the wooden boards etc. but when the sarsons vinegar is placed on the table in its original container, it kind of lets it down. May go back for cafe food and a snack but not a dinner night out.",Date of visit: February 2016,Muddy Beach,1,"Penryn, United Kingdom"
beautiful all round beach,"Perfect all round beach, nice bathing waters, tavern facilities, sunbeds (at a cost), snorkelling on small safe reef, naturist bathing in private (if that's your thing) and a pleasant coastal path walk nearby for those who get bored of sunbathing",Date of experience: September 2015,Paraga Beach,1,"Mykonos, Greece"
"Clean, comfortable and well located","If you are looking for a clean, comfortable, affordable place to stay look no further. Ideally located for buses to town and nearby beaches, this is ideal for those who want to spend their days exploring the island and its beaches. Perfect for sleeping, showering and chilling in the morning and always come back to a clean room and fresh towels. If you are used to sitting around hotels and not going out, this isn't for you and probably not ideal for families for no reason other than there isnt anything to do apart from sleep and shower, although cooking facilities are available.",Date of stay: September 2015,Katerina Studios,1,"Mykonos, Greece"
poor value for money,"paid a little more. expecting a little more and was disappointed. Had to change rooms within a few hours because the T.V wasn't working and went to a room without water or a safe and very little empathy from the receptionist. The rooms are tiny, if you are just looking for a bed for the night, stay elsewhere that is more value.",Date of stay: July 2015,Quality Crown Hyde Park,1,"London, United Kingdom"
