Great Day with Kimberly,"We had a great day with Kimberly. We saw the highlights of Barcelona as well as some areas we wouldn’t have discovered on our own. She also gave us good history about each area. The food at each of the places she chose was delicious and we will go back to a couple of them before we leave here. The last place was some of the best food we have had anywhere and may go back a couple more times. I would definitely recommend her tour, in fact we booked another day to do Girona at the end of our tour of Barcelona. The tips she gave will help us enjoy the rest of our vacation in Barcelona so much more.",Date of experience: September 2019,Local Friend for a Day,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Wonderful View Of Fiordland Park,"We did this trip last minute and are happy we did. It was a beautiful day and we got to see more of the Fiordland National Park then we ever would have. We flew over Dusky and Doubtful sounds and some lesser known sounds as well. Michael was very informative about what we were seeing and seems to really love the area and his job. We enjoyed getting the big picture of the Fiordland Park, it is massive.",Date of experience: January 2019,Fly Fiordland,1,"Te Anau, New Zealand"
Wonderful Experience,We really enjoyed our tour with Earth and Sky. We had a clear night and the amount of stars was amazing but also learning more about the stars and constellations was very interesting to us. The guides were all very nice.We are very glad we included this on our trip to New Zealand.,Date of experience: January 2019,Dark Sky Project,1,"Lake Tekapo, New Zealand"
Very Glad we chose to stay here,"Our stay in Unit 5 was great! It had a beautiful view, walking distance to town, free laundry facilities, a kitchen, and satellite TV so my husband could watch a playoff game while we were in New Zealand. We are very glad we chose to stay there and would recommend.",Date of stay: January 2019,The Chalet Boutique Motel,1,"Lake Tekapo, New Zealand"
Could be Fantastic,"The Good: The location is fantastic! It is very near where the sharks and rays are so you can kayak there easily or you can even walk out about 100 yards at low tide which was around 5am when we were there and saw the sharks swimming. There are also tons of fish right off the deck, no need to even break out the snorkeling gear. I also like the old world style Polynesian decorations a lot. I’m sure it isn’t everyone’s preferred style but for me it was nice to have that style on a tropical island. I found it very charming. The A/C was very nice, it did drip a little bit we just put a towel under it.

The Not So Good: The bed was not very comfortable though it did look very pretty and the roof allowed some drips on the left hand side of the bed during the rain. Just needs a patch up and a new mattress to help these issues.

The only one that speaks some English was Eileen and if you are asking about something she doesn’t like or want to answer then has a particularly hard time understanding. ;). We also felt like Eileen was at best not really customer service oriented unless you weren’t worried at all about how much she was charging or possibly had some questionable business practices. On our final bill we had unexpected charges for tea bags and kayak. She said tea bags were free when she showed us our room but charge $4.50 a tea bag on checkout. This could have been a misunderstanding but the markup seemed excessive. The kayak was supposed to be free for 2 hours according to the activities paper I was emailed , but she said she changed policy in the few months since she sent that so it was charged.

The other big drawback is that the only food available at the hotel is the half board meals which have no choices for food options and are very overpriced. Continental breakfast has almost no protein unless you pay an extra $40pp and entrees and starters for dinner are all fish. Better off to go to the snack shack next door for lunch, grab some pastries and ham and cheese and fruit juice from market at the end of the road for breakfast, and then go to Holy Steak House or somewhere else for dinner. My husband got a steak, side, starters, drinks and I got a huge salad for less than $70 and they provide free pickup. Eileen did make reservations for us twice. Their was a fridge in our room but Eileen doesn’t want outside food put in it, but pastries and rolls keep without and the store is close enough to walk there once a day. That store also had the best price for vanilla beans I found. Everything is very close so food isn’t a big issue to go out and avoid the overpriced meals there. We only did 1 day of meals there but the value and food offered was disappointing- we don’t care much for fish, especially uncooked but I know that is the way most prefer it. I will say that part of that was my fault since I didn't ask what was on the menu before we requested it and the menu wasn’t offered although we were the only guests there for 2 days.

Would we stay there again or recommend?Probably not( and after this review I’m sure Eileen will tell me to go someplace else since we don’t have the “soul” for it) I would check out Airbnb first to see what prices were running for waterfront rental. Our room seemed like a good value for a room on the water compared to big hotel chains but we might have found something more reasonable thru Airbnb or guesthouse, I didn’t check on Moorea like I did on Tahiti for some reason.

Hopefully this will help others make a decision. I should have read more reviews than I did and would have seen what was said about meals and how Eileen responds when anyone says anything that isn’t overwhelmingly positive, she always says she is hurt, shames the writer in some way and then wishes them the best. I fully expect the same treatment. :/ It really is too bad that it is the management that takes the review rating down since I think the hotel and location are really nice.",Date of stay: January 2019,Fenua Mata'i'oa,1,"Moorea, French Polynesia"
Safari Tour,"We took this safari tour while on Moorea and we also used the transport company for pickup from our hotel. Both the driver for the transport and the tour guide were excellent, I am sorry but I don’t remember the name of our guide but it was a woman if that helps. The tour was great! We would definitely recommend.",Date of experience: January 2019,Torea Nui Transports,1,"Moorea, French Polynesia"
Good Place to eat in Moorea,We are here twice while in Moorea. They had free pick up from our hotel and it had lots of options. They have half price drinks until 6:30 for happy hour. It also overlooks the bay and treetops. The Caesar salad was delicious and the Beef Tab was wonderful and a good value. We felt like the beef was comparable to a KC steakhouse. We could also recommend the local chips as appetizers and the potatoes augratin and corn as sides. We would definitely return to this restaurant if in Moorea again.,Date of visit: January 2019,Holy Steak House,1,"Moorea, French Polynesia"
Good tour,"I contacted premium tours regarding a tour for our group of 10. They patiently answered all questions and made suggestions. On the day of the tour, Sandra met us and customized the tour to our requests. We loved it! We got to visit the local open market that we were interested, try a few local food specialties, and see some of the historic sights. It was perfect. Sandra was a great guide.:)",Date of experience: May 2018,Portugal Premium Tours,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Yummy!,Lived up to the hype! Would definitely recommend a trip if you are in Lisbon. They were warm and could see them being made.,Date of visit: May 2018,Pastéis de Belém,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Great food and service,"We are staying at a beach house next to this restaurant. We are here twice already and enjoyed it both times. The food was great, prices are reasonable, the servers are super friendly and has a great view of sunset. We couldn’t ask for anything more! We will go again before we leave.",Date of visit: May 2018,O Golfinho Restaurante Bar,1,"Costa da Caparica, Portugal"
Very good service and food,"We visited the restaurant the first night in Rome and it was the only one we can back to. Leo was awesome! He recognized us each time we walked by and was so friendly to us whether we stopped or not. Our servers Noli and Raul were both great, they catered to our special requests with a smile. The Romeo and Juliet salad was excellent and huge. Lasagna and pizza was great! I would recommend this restaurant with out hesitation! Good prices, good location and good service. :)",Date of visit: May 2018,Hostaria de' Pastini,1,"Rome, Italy"
Not good,"Food wasn’t very expensive but service was bad, food wasn’t great and bathrooms weren’t clean which makes me wonder about cleanliness overall. Would not recommend.",Date of visit: May 2018,La Pace del Cervello,1,"Rome, Italy"
Ephesus Tour and Traditional Turkish Meal,"We loved our tour with Melitour! From the moment we started emailing them, they were so quick and responsive and thoroughly answered every question and gave us a detailed itinerary and invoice and our guides name after we finalized.

We were on a ship and ended up having less time in port than we thought but our guide, Atahan, still managed to get everything in by watching the time carefully. He took us to a family restaurant that served buffet style and had some of the best food we had in our entire Vacation! So many dishes too choose from and everything was wonderful!

Next he took us to Ephesus. He gave us history information on the way and then gave us so much information while we were there about the site that we were amazed. He has degrees in theology, archaeology, and English and helps on the site sometimes so it was so interesting to know up to date archaeological info.

We loved it so much that we want to plan a more in-depth tour with him in the future to go to more sites in Turkey. Definitely recommend!",Date of experience: May 2018,Melitour,1,"Istanbul, Turkey"
Wonderful Trip!,We booked this trip after the snorkel trip we had booked with another boat got cancelled. We could not have been happier and were very glad it worked out that we got to go with captain and his daughter. Our family wanted to snorkel at kleftiko but most boats couldn’t accommodate 10 people so we were very happy that we found this boat. We had brought our own snorkel equipment so it worked out to go on the fishing boat since they could make make it to kleftiko and another beach when other boats could not. Captain Kyriakos and his daughter Tina were so fun and kind and we all feel lucky to have got to spend the afternoon with them. They were great hosts and wonderful to talk with as well as taking us to the beautiful places to snorkel. Water was cold but welcome was warm. I would definitely go out with them again for any type of trip!!,Date of experience: May 2018,Milos Fishing Trip,1,"Milos, Greece"
Great Hotel,"I would definitely stay here again. Great location, great sheets, great breakfast!We overlooked parliament square, we got upgraded and loved the room. It was all very beautiful. The bedding was great and I’m very picky. It is very close to gelato place and bank atm. The girl at the front desk was very helpful. The breakfast had good choices.",Date of stay: May 2018,Hotel Nazionale,1,"Rome, Italy"
Good time!,We had a great time trying to breakout. Very cool room! We need lots of clues from our very kind guide because it was very challenging but we enjoyed all the unique features of the room.,Date of experience: July 2016,Breakout KC Escape Rooms,1,"Kansas City, Missouri"
Great Stay,"We just got back from a 2 night stay. This property was clean, offered a nice hot breakfast, beds were very comfortable with great bedding, offered a great rate and staff was friendly! We couldn't ask for more. The rooms really are very nice and look like they belong in a more expensive hotel. We will definitely stay there again. We booked through Homewood Suites themselves and got the advanced purchase rate of $63 for a King Studio. Good Value!",Date of stay: October 2011,Homewood Suites by Hilton Denver Tech Center,1,"Englewood, Colorado"
