Sailing to Skopelos end other places,We had a great time! We visited the most amazing beaches that can’t be approached by car. We also went to skopelos and some of us tried fishing and it was so fun! Great music and very friendly environment. Highly recommended as it doesn’t feel like an experience designed for tourists but like a friend taking you to the nicest places.,Date of experience: July 2019,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
