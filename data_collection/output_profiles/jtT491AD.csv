Wonderful experience! Very accommodating and friendly people,"I contacted the company about their sunset fishing tours. I would be visiting Santorini in the middle of March. As we communicated, Cap Anthi found out about my needs and she then told me that she could accommodate us on a private basis, which I agreed to. I subsequently found that she had to make adjustments to her own plans as, technically, her season hasn't started and her boat was undergoing its yearly maintenance or servicing, (the boat version, I'm a land lubber so I don't know the correct term.)

She met us prior to the tour to get to know us. And also to ensure that she met our dietary needs. We ended up having a very nice chat and she even walked with us around that village and explained some of its history to us.

The tour itself was amazing. Her dad, who has been fishing in those waters all his life joined us. Despite the language barrier, he made us feel very welcomed. The shrimps tasted fantastic. In fact, almost all the fishes that they cooked for us was fantastic. We got to chose which ones we wanted and they also added some tropical make sure we get to try as much variety as possible.

Like it has been described, we could choose to participate as much as we wanted. I was perfectly happy watching as I know I would have simply been a fifth wheel. Seeing them pull up the nets and traps made me appreciate the amount of work that fishermen did to put those fishes on our tables.

Would definitely go with them again when I visit Santorini again!",Date of experience: March 2018,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Simple good food. Great prices.,"Came across this restaurant near lunch time. As it's the off season. We were the only customers.

Anyways, the owner explained to us the items on the menu and recommended the freshest catches. I had the swordfish steak. The fish was grilled to perfection. Even my wife, who doesn't use like fish thinks that it's great!",Date of visit: March 2018,Taverna Dimitris Vlichada,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Great food! Great service! Friendly prices!,"We had dinner there, on recommendations by our hotel, when we did not manage to locate the place we originally wanted to eat at.

The restaurant is well located near the center of town. And is a very cosy place. On being ushered to our table, we were made very comfortable by our service staff. He made small talk and made excellent recommendations. He was also able to modify our salad to our taste. Through out our time there, the service staff were very attentive and food very served fast.

I had e oven baked lamb and wife had the tomato beef. Both dishes was cooked to perfection. The meats were very tender and seasoned perfectly. Even the rice side dish was cooked pretty well!

Definitely worth the effort to find this place for dinner.",Date of visit: March 2018,Taverna Panellinion,4,"Kalambaka, Greece"
Great location and friendly service!,"On checking in, Ms Evaggelia made us feel very welcomed. She also immediately gave suggestions on where we could have a good dinner. (her recommendations was spot on!) on returning from dinner, we decided to have a night cap at e hotel bar. We were again served by her. I had initially decided on a local wine. However, she gave me a couple of samples to try and I ended up with another wine which was also local and great!

I also noticed that she made the other guests feel very welcomed.

The location of the hotel is very convenient as it is well within walking distance of food establishments. The hotel was also very easy to locate.",Date of stay: March 2018,Theatro Hotel Odysseon,4,"Kalambaka, Greece"
Great food at friendly prices,"We took a tour nearly and decided to have a late lunch on recommendations from our guide. She recommended the Moussa a especially. So my wife had that and I tried the stuffed squid.
The Moussa was heavenly. The topping is custard like consistency. With egg plant and potatoes. It was perfectly baked and e seasoning of e meat sets off fireworks in the my brain. Definitely 5/5 for this.
My stuff quid was grilled to nicely, stuffed with cheese and tomatoes. I would give it a 4.5/5.
The staff, I think they were the owners, were very attentive but unobtrusive.",Date of visit: March 2018,Trattoria Plaka,4,"Athens, Greece"
