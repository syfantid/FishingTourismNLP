Fantastic for kids,"Small NGO with the biggest heart ever. Wonderful volunteer who was passionate and knowledgeable gave us a detailed tour in which she answered many questions patiently. We forgot to ask her name but she WILL be a terrific vet one day! If you have the opportunity to visit, please go and spend money in the gift shop—we found a tshirt, key chain and necklaces that we were more than happy to buy to support this noble organization —-please keep up the great work!",Date of experience: August 2020,ARCHELON Τhe Sea Turtle Protection Society of Greece,5,"Glyfada, Greece"
Kids’ favorite,"Always delicious, never ever disappointing. Kids adore the burger, which oozes out cheese when you bite into it. We love the spare ribs ! The salad with the beef on top is a guilt-free dish packed with protein and so beautiful with the pomegranate seeds. The owner is such a friendly, humble human being, and the rest of the staff is attentive. We also love the South African-themed posters with wise sayings. If Kozi’s sold T-shirts or mugs with these sayings, they would be a hit!",Date of visit: August 2020,Kozi's,5,"Melissia, Greece"
A great afternoon,"This was one of our best memories of Santorini. Maria was our sommelier and tour guide : knowledgable, polite, patient, and wonderful with our children. She is beautiful inside and out. We left with many bottles of wine. We couldn’t help it! Thank you for a lovely afternoon!",Date of experience: June 2020,Estate Argyros,5,"Santorini, Greece"
"Timeless, unique and family friendly","Every now and then, you find a piece of jewelry that becomes a part of you, in the same way that a wedding ring often does.

It always amazes me the number of compliments I receive on this magnificent and unique silver bracelet which I have named Odysseus the Octo. It was love at first sight. Odysseus follows me wherever I go, protecting me and making me smile. He has broken the ice for me with many people and I am grateful to George, Nefeli, and the rest of the warm and friendly Team at Aphrodite for introducing me to this love of my life.

This Team is always so good with my children, who recently helped me pick out a pair of birthday earrings for Grandma. My family and friends are always pleased with gifts from this shop, because the pieces are tasteful and timeless.

My husband should be jealous of Odysseus, but instead he bought a pair of gorgeous octopus cufflinks (same jewelry designer.) You will likely find your perfect ""match"" there as well.

As for me, Odysseus is asking for some company, so I will likely soon be shopping for an octopus ring, necklace or earrings to join in our Greek adventures!",Date of experience: August 2020,Aphrodite Jewelry,5,"Athens, Greece"
Wonderful breakfast!,"Our family of four so enjoyed our breakfast here! Our omelettes and the pancakes were delicious. The coffees too! Our children also loved the yogurt with fruit. The staff were SUPER friendly, kind, and gave good advice on what to do/see on Milos. THANK YOU and wishing you continued success into the future!",Date of visit: July 2020,Deck Coffee-Brunch-Cocktail,5,"Milos, Greece"
Wonderful family stay,"From the moment we arrived we were treated so warmly by Mr. Stefanos Lampris and his team. Upon first impression you are struck with how NEW and CLEAN everything is. The rooms were spotless, the rain style shower had plenty of hot water, beds very comfortable, the breakfast with a wide variety and delicious, the 3 pools were clean and enjoyed by our children. Complete satisfaction. Mr. Lampris also gave excellent advice about touring around Naxos. We wish you continued success into the future and look forward to our next stay with you on Naxos.",Date of stay: July 2020,Naxian Emerald Hotel,5,"Naxos, Greece"
Great dinner,"We enjoy Greek food but wanted something different tonight. The service was great. The caprese salad was SO refreshing. The Neapolitan linguine was light and the veggie pizza was full of eggplant, zucchini and red peppers: delicious not a crumb was left. We went light and it was perfect. Thank you!",Date of visit: July 2020,Stratos Pizzeria Restaurant,5,"Antiparos, Greece"
One of our best memories ever!,"Captain Anthi is such a sincere, hardworking Super Lady. She and Mohammed took such good care of our family. Watching the live shrimp and fish come out of the water, wriggling out of their nets was exciting for the children. Anthi gave a biology lesson, explaining the features of the various fish and cuttlefish that were caught. They were eco friendly, too, throwing back those too small. Then, we swam and ate the fresh catch —-the shrimp were deep fried and delicious —-like shrimp flavored potato chips! The fish and eel were grilled. The Greek salad was so tasty, grilled zucchini and white Santorini eggplant too, with bread and a rice pasta dish, heavenly! I drank too much white wine and had to nap. Anthi taught the children two fishing methods, one with bread and the other using shrimp and cuttlefish as bait—we caught several fish, including 2 that were grilled for us. We threw the other ones back. I highly recommend this experience, especially for those with children. It’s a fantastic memory of Santorini.",Date of experience: July 2020,santorini family friendly fishing tour private all inclusive,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Everything we hoped for and more,"This place was perfect for our family of four—- the children had their own room + bathroom, and so did the parents. In addition, the apartment had a kitchen and living room. I loved the outdoor seating area and the outdoor clothes rack for daily washing of clothes . Nikolas and his Mama warmly greeted us and kindly provided welcome baskets, water and wine. The Mama had baked a delicious pound cake and apple jam cake during our stay. The Korres toiletries were a nice touch, as well as the daily service of cleaning and making beds. We were spoiled. Nikolas gave me a strong athletic massage on our last day, and I needed it soooo much and my back will be forever grateful! It’s in an excellent location, a 5 minute walk to Pollonia and also the Konstantakis Cave Winery. I highly recommend Flag Suites!",Date of stay: July 2020,Flag Suites,5,"Milos, Greece"
Five star experience,"Excellent souvlaki and schnitzel but more than this, a warm family who helped us. We wish you continued success!",Date of visit: October 2019,Gonía Elia,5,"Vergina, Greece"
The details....!,"Excellent experience. The bed was comfy and there was hot water for the shower. But the details are what make this place a gem: Loved the lavender toiletries, filtered water and wine chilled waiting. Unlimited coffee access. WiFi. Interesting artwork. But it was the breakfasts prepared by Mindy that blew us away. Thank you for the creative and delicious start to our mornings. Thank you for the pleasant conversation and a memorable stay!",Date of stay: July 2019,The Texas White House Bed & Breakfast,5,"Fort Worth, Texas"
Good for families,"Ms. Anna was a wonderful host. She greeted us upon our arrival. She doesn’t much speak English, but her son does. The attention to detail is what I liked most about Yades. The sofa bed was prepared for our two children. The kitchen was stocked with teas, coffees, and the refrigerator had Creta Farm ham, cheese, bread, juice, and milk. There was a lovely homemade chocolate cake that was waiting upon our arrival. The two rooms were warm and cozy, and there was hot water for a shower, and the place was impeccably clean. For me, the place does not have to be fancy, only clean and with a good breakfast. She didn’t disappoint. There were freshly made, hot eggs (from her farm hens), bacon, blinis, salad, and cheese toast. We were completely spoiled. I mentioned the attention to detail: I loved the handmade lace tablecloth and pillowcases. They looked like family heirlooms. It was a lovely stay and a good rest from our daily busy lives. Thank you, Anna, for your kind hospitality!",Date of stay: January 2019,Yades Guest House,5,"Arachova, Greece"
Warm owners. Quiet location. Fantastic breakfast!,"The one memory I will never forget here is the staff, who were so friendly and made us feel at home. Our children loved the pool. The location is in a quieter neighborhood than the hustle and bustle of downtown Chania, and with a car, it was no problem. What a view from the balcony! The breakfast featured bacon and eggs, cooked however we wanted, along with the rest of the buffet of fresh bread, fruit and yogurt. Very clean rooms and hot water. Free Internet and parking. What more could we ask for? Nothing at all. Thank you for the lovely stay.",Date of stay: November 2018,Monte Vardia,5,"Crete, Greece"
Fantastic Gaston!!,A very sweet condensed version of the story. I have to compliment Gaston....he stole the show. He nailed the character perfectly!,Date of experience: July 2018,Beauty and the Beast Live on Stage,5,"Orlando, Florida"
Great for lunch with children,"Went to several highly rated places in Nafplio, looking for lunch for two hungry families, including children. It was just before noon, and all of the restaurants were not opening for another hour. What to do ? We kept walking, and stumbled upon this gem of a place. The rolled eggplant as well as the eggplant with tomato sauce were excellent. Also enjoyed buffalo pitas, the octopus, grilled chicken, and the Greek salad. We finished with coffees and all were happy. I have to emphasize how kind and accommodating the staff were. Our waitress was a joy and smiley. Would love to return here the next time we are in Nafplio.",Date of visit: December 2017,Menta,5,"Nafplio, Greece"
"Perfect: simple, clean, and friendly","Fotini was at the front desk when we arrived, and everything she recommended for us was just.....perfect. The restaurants, the winery tour, the catamarans sailing tour....it was like she could read our minds for what we wanted. Room was well cleaned, and we enjoyed the sunny balcony. Breakfast was good, with delicious breakfast pizza, eggs, bacon, fresh fruit, bread, and yogurt. Would love to stay there again. Thank you, Fotini, for everything.",Date of stay: May 2016,Anassa Deluxe Suites,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Great family spot,"We spent four happy days there. We drove but could not arrive until 11:30 pm, and---bless her heart----the Mom waited up for us, was cheerful, and made our children's bed from the sofa in a flash. Our children thoroughly enjoyed the clean pool every late afternoon. We spent every morning/afternoon at a different beach....Molunat, Mlini, and explored the not-to-be-missed agrotourism farm, Seoska Kuca, that is a five a minute walk away. The apartment was spotless, beds comfortable, and we used the kitchen to make simple breakfasts and dinners (we had wonderful seafood at various restaurants for lunch). I loved the laundry wires on the balcony.....our laundry dried very quickly every day. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a peaceful, relaxing getaway.",Date of stay: August 2015,Apartments Grand Pinea,5,"Cilipi, Croatia"
a special memory,"Hedona is the place you go with your closest friends to celebrate a special occasion---or maybe just to enjoy a meal different from anything else down in Sarajevo. Arman, the owner, is a gifted conversationalist and food expert. He is so interesting to talk to, that we keep going back to hear more and of course eat more.

As for the meal, Arman and his staff make the evening a lasting memory. The view is spectacular. The food is presented artfully and is delicious. I always lose count of the number of courses....maybe 8 or 9? And with each course Arman has selected a different bottle of wine. Their cauliflower soup was a hit with my husband that hates this vegetable---that should say it all. The salmon was delicious and prepared perfectly. The spices and ingredients are so interesting that you and your friends will enjoy guessing what the chef used, and Arman is happy to elaborate.

Halfway through the meal, we enjoyed a tour of Arman's wine cellar, where he shared with us his rose champagne that was bubbly and slightly sweet.

Arrange your reservation in time for sunset. Google map your way there just in case your taxi driver gets lost. At 150km, you may think this is expensive, but when you leave Hedona, you think, ""What value!""

Hedona is a unique experience and one we would recommend again and again.",Date of visit: July 2015,Hedona Wine Club,5,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"
"Friendly, clean, and great location","Thank you for a wonderful stay. Free parking and smiles to greet. Clean room and comfy beds. Loved the common kitchen area, where we made hot tea. Two minute walk to bridge and great lunch and dinner spot, Sevrdan. Breakfast omelette at nearby cafe recommended! Thank you again...",Date of stay: December 2014,Pansion Cardak,5,"Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina"
Fantastic for families,"Our children really enjoyed the soft floor playground and petting zoo, which included donkeys, sheep, chickens, peacocks and a turkey. The water bugs and tadpoles were a huge hit, too.

The staff was especially helpful when one of our children got a splinter. The lady at the front desk swiftly produced a sewing kit and a glass of rakia (she offered the entire bottle first). She explained that rakia is used like a medicine and she was right--it worked. We soon had the splinter out and skin disinfected.

After our trip, we noticed that we were missing a stuffed animal. If you are a parent, you may know how traumatic this can be. I emailed Herceg Etno Selo and a reply was soon received, saying that the animal had been found, and they soon mailed it to us. You can imagine the smiles when the tiny package arrived.

It is small touches like these that made our trip here memorable, and the restaurant was good, too. Great spaghetti bolonnaise--another favorite of our little ones.

Also, we recommend getting the suite--it was very modern and comfortable.",Date of stay: April 2013,Herceg Etno selo Medjugorje,5,"Medjugorje, Bosnia and Herzegovina"
