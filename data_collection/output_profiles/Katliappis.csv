"Liked it so much, did it twice!","This was my second time going on the trip with Dimitri (my family and I went two years prior) and it was even better than the last time! A beautiful excursion out at sea, fresh-caught sea urchins for lunch (and an amazing fruit plate for dessert!) and snorkeling with Dimitri while he lured in fish for us to see was a “twice” in a lifetime experience. Captain Dimitri is friendly and engaging, and he has constantly worked towards making his experience better every time (something I can personally attest to). If you’re in Skiathos, this is the perfect day-trip!",Date of experience: July 2019,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
