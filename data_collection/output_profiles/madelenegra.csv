Our best experience on Milos,"We wanted to go fishing on the island and came across this tour. It exceeded our expectations as we spent the whole day feeling like part of Tina's beautiful family as we caught fish, swam in crystal clear waters away from masses of tourists, and ate fresh grilled fish on the boat! It was such good value with the lunch included plus taking home any self caught fish.

We were lucky enough to have a private tour as not in peak season and they tailored it to our every wishes.

Those crystal clear waters of Kleftiko will be in my mind forever!

Thanks to the whole family for such warmth and hospitality !!",Date of experience: June 2019,Milos Fishing Trip,4,"Milos, Greece"
Peaceful woodfire pizza,"We had a beautiful dinner of a giant woodfire pizza in the square under the church. The amazing smells drew us in, and after eating lots of traditional greek meals a woodfire pizza was a tasty treat! Run by a lovely familt.",Date of visit: May 2019,Pizzeria Stasi,4,"Milos, Greece"
