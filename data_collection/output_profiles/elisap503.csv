Fantastic Day,"We had really fantastic time with this tour. We were ten people and it felt like having a private boat to ourselves to enjoy. The captain and the daughter are really nice people and the fishing part was good fun. The lunch , the fresh fished cooked on the boat, was amazing,plus there were many more thing to eat, from the cake in the morning to some snack before lunch and plenty of drinks. I appreciated a lot that the swimming stops were very long without any stricht time schedule and in spots that were a bit aside from where the other bigger boats. From what I have seen around, I believe this trip offers you something different from the other tours and it is really worth it particularly if you are more interested to enjoy a day on the sea more than making the tour of the entire island.",Date of experience: July 2019,Milos Fishing Trip,4,"Milos, Greece"
Highly Recommended,"The apartment was nice, modern, comfortable and very clean. It is located to a walking distance next to everything you might need , from restaurants to supermarkets and center of the town or beaches. In addition to that, what made a real difference, was the attention of the owner Nickolas and his staff on details and availability to help the Customers. Nickolas went to pick us up at the hangout when we arrived; we found water and fruits and juice in the fridge during our stay; we got recommendations about best places to visit and help with the rental car to such a way that the car was delivered at our door and it was picked up at the end with zero stress. Not very often, if ever, I got this type of service and attention and dedication, customer service at its highest level.",Date of stay: July 2019,Ageri-Milos,4,"Milos, Greece"
Very good experience,"We stayed in this hotel for 10 nights, paying a bit more for a room on the 16 the floor which was totally worth the money. The hotel was clean, with nice staff in the reception and in the bar. The room spacious enough. The breakfast was excellent and a good deal considering the average prices in Manhattan. The location is perfect, close to several subways stations to move around in the city and some walking minutes away to soho restaurant and night life. I would definitely go back.",Date of stay: June 2017,Soho 54,4,"New York City, New York"
For business travel,"The hotel is very close to the Luton airport, 10 mins walking,so very good if you need a one night stop for travelling or you have business in the area. My room was small but modern,comfortable,clean and silent ( important as the hotel is in front of the aircrafts runway). The staff has been very polite and helpfull. The restaurant and bar are good with a kind of familiar atmosphere. They provide food service in the room if you don't fancy eating in the restaurant. Breakfast is 8.50 pounds which I think is very good considering you have plenty of choices and the general breakfast prices you normally fimd in the hotels around Europe.",Date of stay: October 2016,Holiday Inn London - Luton Airport,4,"Luton, United Kingdom"
Super place,"My experience with Indian food are the Indian restaurants in Germany and I think is deeply true that the Indians in UK are a step higher. So it easy to make me happy, however I found this restaurant particularly good, very fresh ingredients, wide choice, lively location and extremely nice staff. Definitely recommended",Date of visit: October 2016,Jay Raj Indian Cuisine,4,"Luton, United Kingdom"
Absolutely recommended,"We stayed in this hotel for a weekend and I can only recommend it. The room was very nice with modern furniture,very clean and, rare in London, spacious. The reception is instead a pub style one,which makes you feel more in London than the anonymous hotel chains. I found the price really worthy considering breakfast was included..and what a breakfast!I would come back only for their eggs benedict with those poaches eggs cooked at perfection. Nice also to find some drinks offered in the room and complementary newspaper in the morning. Details that make a difference",Date of stay: October 2016,Chamberlain Hotel,4,"London, United Kingdom"

Good hotel,"I have been in this hotel over the New Years Eve. The hotel is very nice, new clean and the stuff very friendly and helpfull. The compulsory breakfast has lots of good food variety. Nevertheless the hotel is to my opinion more suitable for short time trip as the rooms are small and missing of some practical things like the drawers or wardrobe.Not so practical of you have to stay one week.",Date of stay: January 2016,Hampton by Hilton Warsaw City Centre,4,"Warsaw, Poland"
Classy restaurant,"Excellent polish restaurant I would recommend. The ambient is very elegant and beautiful, service is high level and food very good.

As being home,"I often go to this restaurant as I'm Italian and I live 500m far from it. I like the food which is sometimes adapted to German taste but nevertheless very good. However, If I ask something Italian out of the menu they always make it for me at moment. The stuff is very friendly and fun and this is the main reason why I keep going there as they make me feel home.",Date of visit: January 2016,La Marianna,4,"Berlin, Germany"
Excellent,"The hotel is well located in downtown and it looks like just renovated. The rooms are big clean and comfortable, the staff excellent and the breakfast fantastic.If you want, the gym is also very nice.

I would definitely come back here if I came back to Montreal.",Date of stay: October 2015,Novotel Montreal Centre,4,"Montreal, Canada"
Excellent Food and Wine,"Steakhouse with brilliant meat and wine. The service was at the same level. Be aware the prices are high, pretty easy to go over 100$ per person.you can find wine bottle for up to 1500$. If money is not a problem, definitely give it a try!",Date of visit: August 2015,Morton's The Steakhouse,4,"Chicago, Illinois"
Nice Italian restaurant,"We had a very nice dinner here, with good and well presented food. Despite other comments as Italian I found it pretty close to Italian food, particularly from Veneto's area. The prices are not cheap but not too high considering you are in NYC and some meters from Time Square. Definitely recommended.",Date of visit: August 2015,Osteria al Doge,4,"New York City, New York"
