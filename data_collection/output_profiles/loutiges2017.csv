Superb,Just went there for drinks but was a superb experience. The bar staff were lovely and friendly and the lady singing was an incredible performer.,Date of visit: November 2018,Casa Mayahuel,4,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico"
Munter,"the food was okay but the service was poor. Took us a long time to be served, the waiter hardly acknowledged us, and many idle staff. At the end we put in a smaller tip due to our lack of satisfaction but the waiter said we had no choice but to tip 15 per cent and took the machine to add the tip without our consent. Unhappy with this and wonâ€™t be returning",Date of visit: November 2018,EatItaly By Il Baretto,4,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico"
