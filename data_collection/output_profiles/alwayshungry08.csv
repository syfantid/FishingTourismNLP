Paradise in Leh,"We stayed here for 2 days with family. You can call it a resort or a hotel. The owner has thought through well before building this place. Whoever is visiting leh, they need 2 days to acclimatize. When you land in leh, they say 24 hours but i recommend 48 hours with minimal pgysical activity. Thr last resort is a high end tent so you feel close to nature and the place will accelerate acclimatisation. Food is really out of the world. It is home cooked food which is rare to get. For exampls, they have home made pickle, organic honey and they ask your preference before preparing the food. I suggest you go with their recommendations as they know what to prepare for the climate",Date of stay: August 2018,The Last Resort,1,"Leh, India"

Fastest way to commute in bangkok,I travel every week in and out of bangkok through suvarnabumi airport. It is the fastest and cheapest way to commute to and from airport.

Mini idly and Podi onion uthappam,I liked the concept of going to a restaurant just for idly and uthappam as idli is a comfort food for South Indians.

Piping Hot Idlis,Any south indian will say they have eaten better idli than murugan idli but what stands out at this place is you get 3 different chutneys and sambar along with idli.
