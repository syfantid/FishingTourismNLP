Absolute BEST Way to Spend a Day on the Sea!,"We spent a day on the sea with Captain Giannis Anagnostopoulos on board the Poseidon Poros! We pulled in some long lines that Giannis had baited and dropped the night before, and “caught” our lunch for the day. Not satisfied with the number of fish, Giannis put on his spearfishing gear and brought in a Golden Grouper. He laid out a beautiful table with cheese, salad, fruit, grilled bread, tzatziki, beer and wine, to accompany our delicious, fresh, grilled fish. Swimming, snorkeling and lounging in the sea made the afternoon perfect! #flyingoliveadventures #poseidontours #sunandsea",Date of experience: June 2019,Poseidon Fishing Trips,4,"Poros, Greece"
Accommodations and Staff are #1!,"The Odyssey, in my opinion, is the best and most authentic travel experience you can find on Poros, and perhaps all of Greece. Stunning, upgraded rooms with sea views, delicious bistro fare and welcoming, helpful staff, like Michelle and Stella, Katerina and Dora, make your stay top notch. I’ve been coming here for years now, and the Odyssey keeps getting better and better!",Date of stay: June 2019,Odyssey Suites,4,"Poros, Greece"
Excellent Lunch!,Our London cabbie suggested we have lunch here after our visit to the Tower of London. We started to walk from the Tower then realized we needed to take a cab. It was a GREAT place with the most fascinating history. We enjoyed a traditional fish and chips lunch. The young wait staff were super-friendly and very interesting. We enjoyed the river view and the nautical lore!,Date of visit: October 2016,Prospect Of Whitby,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Must Visit!,"My husband and I traveled here with his mother. We don;t generally like to do the ""touristy"" things when we travel but this was definitely a must-do if you want to get a feel for the history of London. The Crown Jewels were definitely worth waiting in line to see. We especially enjoyed the theatrical performances and interactivity of the presentations. Hilarious, informative and entertaining!",Date of experience: October 2016,Tower of London,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Right out of a Movie,"I brought a group of 20 here for lunch as we traveled from the airport to our villa in Tuscany. This was the perfect setting to get my group in the Tuscan frame of mind! Beautiful location and views, simple, exquisite food and lovely wines. We all left here satiated and ready to become Italian for a week! They handles our group with finesse and charm. It was such a perfect experience, I am taking another group there this year!",Date of visit: September 2016,Ristorante L'Antica Scuderia,4,"Tavarnelle Val di Pesa, Italy"
Very Good,"We stayed here the weekend that EdFringe was beginning. The accommodations were excellent, the location, SUPER, but the beer garden in the courtyard was packed and noisy with screaming revellers until the wee hours EVERY night. I'm sure if I was much younger, we would have been fine. Be sure to request a QUIET room and make sure that yours is not overlooking the beer garden. I would stay here again and again. Great value and lovely rooms...as long as you ask for a QUIET room! :)",Date of stay: August 2016,Stay Central Hotel,4,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Great Place For People Watching,"We visited as EdFringe was setting up. Amazing sights to see, lots of youthful energy. FUN! I only wish that our stay had extended into the actual music festival. We got a good taste of what was to come.",Date of experience: August 2016,Royal Mile,4,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Great Beers and Fish n Chips,"We had to have our last nice meal of traditional fish n chips here. We loved the atmosphere, the service and the food. My husband loved the t-shirts...and bought one. Would definitely recommend! Go! Have a pint and have fun!",Date of visit: August 2016,The Advocate,4,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
The Locals Love The Lorne Bar,"My friend, who is from Oban, loves this place. He brought my group of visiting friends here for traditional Scottish fare. We were not disappointed! Great beers and all of the food was excellent. Mussels, Chicken and Haggis, Smoked Salmon. We ate so much we chose to forego dessert. Lots of funa nd a great pub atmosphere. Can't wait to visit Oban again and The Lorne Bar.",Date of visit: July 2016,The Lorne Bar,4,"Oban, United Kingdom"
Podere Incrociati - My Tuscan Home Away from Home,"I hosted a group of 20 adults here for a yoga retreat. The entire party was so thrilled with this podere, its staff, owner, and overall ambiance. We truly felt we had a real taste of Tuscan hospitality. The accommodations were comfortable and immaculate. This is a property that I will return to again and again. Thank you Franco and staff.",Date of stay: September 2016,Podere Incrociati,4,"Sovicille, Italy"
A Highlight of our Tuscan Adventure!,"I hosted a group of 20 to come to Casamonti for a farm tour, wine tasting and luncheon. Every single guest went away smiling, satisfied, and educated on the wonderful work that Raymond and Anna Rita are doing in the wine, oil and Cinta Senese industries. This is a must-do when in Tuscany. Great food, wine, olive oil and the BEST hospitality!",Date of experience: September 2016,Azienda Agricola Casamonti,4,"Castellina In Chianti, Italy"
Giacomo will make your experience special!,"Giacomo and his staff (hi Fabio!) were amazing hosts and guides for my group of 20 yoga travelers. He assisted me in planning and executing a memorable holiday for my travelers and each and every one of these people fell in love with Giacomo, his warmth and care in meeting our travel needs. You will be in good hands with Giacomo!",Date of experience: September 2016,Ghibellina Tours,4,"Certaldo, Italy"
