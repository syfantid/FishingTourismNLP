The Poseideon Adventure,"If you want to feel the real greek ambience this is the right choice. The boat crew makes you feel the beauty of their sea and land. They make you feel part of the family as well, always being attentive with us, smiling always and make sure we feel good. The places they took us were just unbelievably precious and unforgettable. The captain is a really Poseidon! And the fished cooked there on the boat was the icing on the cake!
Thank you very much Andreas, Andreas and Marios! You are special people.
