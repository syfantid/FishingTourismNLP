Completely Untemarkable,"I’m bummed about this place, because the reviews were so positive. I came here with my 1.5 year old daughter and 3 other adults. We were quickly seated, but I think our server must have been new. That’s not a criticism of the restaurant, or the server, just might be related to our experience.
We waited a while for our food, which was 2 orders of unimpressive avocado toast, a pancake, and biscuits & gravy.
The pancake was perfectly good, it’s hard to screw that up. My mom got the weirdest chicken noodle soup, it tasted like pickle juice was in it or something.
Maybe we chose the wrong items from the menu & maybe we hit them on an off day, unfortunately, this experience just fell flat.

I’m not expecting perfection, it’s just a local diner, but still.",Date of visit: June 2020,Mary's Kitchen,1,"Geneva on the Lake, Ohio"
Not Bad,"We came into GOTL to eat at another restaurant, but many places are closed, presumably due to COVID-19. We saw this place was open so we stopped over. They have a walk-up menu with tables outside under a roof to eat at, if you want.
We ordered our food to go.
We got a LOT of cheese foods, because my sister is a vegetarian. A cheese calzone (HUGE, good to share with someone,) a caprese salad, 2 orders of fried provolone and a medium mushroom pizza.
Our total was about $50 and we have quite a bit of leftovers. The pizza had very little sauce, but LOTS of cheese. The fried cheese was good, but the ‘marinara’ was more like salsa in my opinion.
This place has a lot of options, nothing too healthy, but still, lots of choices. It was pretty quick.
Like the title says, not bad. Didn’t change my life.",Date of visit: June 2020,Zeppe's Pizza,1,"Geneva, Ohio"
"Spacious, clean rooms, great breakfast","I’ve really enjoyed staying here. We have an over-night layover. They have a free shuttle to & from the airport, large rooms, large bathrooms and a beautiful shower. Breakfast is nice as well, this morning we had 2 options for omelettes, pancakes, 2 sausage options, fruit, yogurt, muffins & plain bagels, cereal, oatmeal, and a few juices. Very nice staff. Highly recommend, I wish we were staying here longer!",Date of stay: January 2020,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Houston IAH - Beltway 8,1,"Houston, Texas"
A great spot,We came here while visiting family. They come to this spot every Monday and they employees know them. We ordered tacos and went next door to the brewery and ate over there. It was delicious!,Date of visit: August 2019,Osprey Tacos,1,"St. Augustine, Florida"
Amazing food at very affordable prices,"What a great spot! My husband, daughter & I were looking for lunch and came across Harry’s. After seeing the outdoor eating area we could resist eating out there. Lenny and Amy took care of us and did a great job. We had the crab cake appetizer (came with 2 cakes,) blackened tuna entree and the oyster po’boy with seasonal veggies (zucchini, squash & broccoli.) everything was huge and fabulous. The cost was surprisingly inexpensive for the quality, especially when you consider the size of the portions!
Very nice spot, I highly recommend it.",Date of visit: August 2019,Harry's Seafood Bar and Grille,1,"St. Augustine, Florida"
"Quality seafood, reasonable prices, lovely view","I’m so glad we came here! We are out-of-towners here visiting family and friends. Our local friend recommended this place and it was wonderful. Three adults ate and shared an appetizer and our bill was ~$95. There was a wait and they don’t accept reservations, but they will text you when your table is ready. Our wait was 30 minutes at 6pm on a Saturday in August, so not completely unexpected.
Our seats were outside with a view of the water & ships. Eric was our server and he was kind and friendly.
Now to the food, they had a featured appetizer, royal red shrimp cocktail. It wasn’t what we had expected, it was shelled and tossed in a light mayo sauce, no cocktail. It didn’t need it, it was refreshing and tender. It came with 6 shrimp. Three adults were in my party and my 8-month-old. One adult had their bleu cheese topped ribeye special and he enjoyed his meal. Another adult had the pick 2 fried fish, she ordered deviled crab and shrimp, she loved it and said she would order it again. I had a very hard time choosing, rock-paper-scissors was involved, and I ended up getting clam chowder and a half dozen oysters. My meal was lovely. I wish we would have had time for dessert, but babycakes was ready to go.

For parents, they do have high chairs and a changing table in the women’s bathroom, I don’t know about the men’s. There are kids options as well.

I definitely recommend this spot, wonderful seafood and great ambiance.",Date of visit: August 2019,Julington Creek Fish Camp,1,"Jacksonville, Florida"
Choose another spot,"We chose this restaurant based on the good reviews, but were disappointed. We started with a dozen raw oysters, which were almost flavorless. My husband ordered the trigger special with lobster sauce, this just missed the mark. $22, wasn’t worth $8 for the flavor. I had the steamed and raw clams. The steamed clams were fine- overcooked, but not bad. I wasn’t a fan of the raw clams, but that was my first time trying them, so I can’t pin that in the restaurant.

We didn’t finish our meals and I was so hungry once we got back to the hotel that I got a grilled cheese sandwich where we were staying! Save yourselves the trouble and eat someplace else",Date of visit: August 2019,Beachside Seafood,1,"Jacksonville Beach, Florida"
"Not bad, not sure if it was worth the price","We stayed here for our Niece’s wedding and paid $250 for a night here (it writing this before checking out.)

BREAKFAST
The breakfast room is HUGE and there are many options. Bacon, eggs, French toast, potatoes, sausage, fresh fruit, oatmeal, cereal, some bread options too.

ROOMS
We needed two double beds & we did get two double beds, a bathroom & a living room with a sitting table and a pull out couch. There are two TVs. This was a life saver because my husband snores, so our daughter & I got to sleep in the bedroom & we sent him to the couch bed. There is a door between them. We used the iron last night & it snagged the crap out of my skirt, it looked like it had fallen on the ground, so just be cautious with that.
Everything was clean enough, as far as hotel rooms go. It’s definitely nothing fancy, but it’s acceptable.

VIEW
Our room was labeled as a ‘noncore room’ but that was not the case. Our room overlooked the river, so you might get more than you bargained for!

PARKING
There is a garage attached to the hotel. Parking is $10/day if you self park & $26 for valet.

I have no major complaints about this hotel. I was a bit surprised, knowing what we paid. I would expect a place like this to be more in the $175 range, but we booked directly through the hotel, so maybe that was my mistake. It’s perfectly good. There is a pool, but we didn’t get the chance to explore it, and it is open during the construction.",Date of stay: June 2018,Embassy Suites Cincinnati Rivercenter,1,"Covington, Kentucky"
I LOVED IT!!,"We stopped in here after seeing the Empire State Building. If you like seafood, this is the place to go! We got raw oysters, oyster poboy, shrimp poboy, fried catfish & jambalaya. Our server was very well dressed, polite, efficient & quick. Everything was fantastic!!!",Date of visit: May 2018,CajunSea & Oyster Bar,1,"New York City, New York"
Went to the Huron restaurant- Strongly Recommend!!!,"We absolutely LOVED this place! We stopped in because we love Thai food. We arrived at 8pm and we were the only customers there.
We started off with hot & sour soup and cucumber salad that came with our meals. I’m not usually a fan of that soup, but I actually enjoyed it! It was the best I’ve had.
The cucumber salad had seaweed and a delicious vinegar dressing. We inhaled it.

For appetizers we enjoyed the fried tofu and ‘fresh’ rolls. The fried tofu was very good, and the fresh rolls were summer rolls. Shrimp, cucumber, cilantro, rice noodles, with a peanut sauce. I make these at home, they were awesome.

For our entrees we shared Thai green curry with chicken and beef, along with pad Thai. The best I’ve ever had!! Every single thing we ordered was delicious, and the server was patient and informed.
There were three of us and the bill was $39, definitely try it out.",Date of visit: February 2018,Jo Wok,1,"Sandusky, Ohio"
"Fabulous porch, food is fine.","We came to Cowgirl’s BBQ today because the patio was exactly what we were looking for. We sat outside, though there is a lot of indoor seating, and had the pleasure of listening to a jazz band while we ate. My dad got a flight of beer and my friend and I got margaritas. Both were good.
They are having an Oktoberfest special , so some of the items we got might not always be available.
The Asian hoisin short ribs had good flavor, but they were a bit dry.
My dad got a brat pairing of a guiness beer brat and a rattlesnake-rabbit brat. I tried the latter and it was fine.
Mom got. Buffalo burger that she really enjoyed, along with sweet potato fries and a sweet dipping sauce.
My friend and I both got pulled pork sandwiches. We should have bought one to split because neither of us finished. It was alright, could have used some more bbq sauce.
Finally. We had strawberry shortcake, which was also fine.

Our server, Nicole was very nice and did a great job. The band was great and the atmosphere in general was great. The good was good enough and it was worth it for the experience.",Date of visit: October 2017,Cowgirl BBQ,1,"Santa Fe, New Mexico"
"Spicy, but delicious!","I came here with my folks and best friend for supper while in town for the Balloon Fiesta. My dad LOVES trying different types of beers and enjoyed everything he tasted (IPAs.)
We tried the chips and salsa, which was very spicy, but good. The street tacos were good, the steak was my favorite choice, but my mom preferred the pork. My dad got their wings, which were very spicy as well. He described them as ‘just fine.’ My favorite was the Thai mussels. Great coconut milk flavor. They were a bit spicy too, but worth the heat!
The service was great. I was surprised it wasn’t too busy. Everything came quickly and hot.
Definitely worth checking out.",Date of visit: October 2017,Bosque Brewing Company,1,"Albuquerque, New Mexico"
So Accommodating- Very Glad We Stayed Here,"I have so many wonderful things to say about this place.

Location: Firostefani is a wonderful location, because it's for gorgeous views of the Caldera, and those beautiful buildings on the hills. It's a smaller town, so it's not so crammed as Fira and Oia, but it still has tons of restaurants and shops to choose from. And it's walking distance from Fira. It's centrally located and still quaint.

Reservations: I booked our room through a third party agency (I can't remember if it was trip advisor or Expedia) and soon after I received an email from the hotel. They were making sure that they received the correct information for our reservation. I guess sometimes the agency gives incorrect info? I thought that was so special, they wanted to ensure we were happy and that we got what we wanted.

Customer Care: Our trip was to celebrate my fiance's 50th birthday, and Mary helped me book a surprise couple's massage in our room after breakfast. She contacted different businesses and sorted out all the details for me. Another employee helped me book a fishing excursion, all of these things were done months before we arrived. When you check in, Mary goes over everything, from breakfast, to the neighborhood, things to do & restaurants to try. She was so sweet and helpful through our whole stay, she's an absolute doll. George was wonderful too! Very friendly and helpful, it just so happened that most of my interaction was with Mary, due to all the birthday plans.

Accommodation: We stayed in room 2. It had a balcony with a lovely view. I can't speak for any other hotels or rooms, but the rooms aren't large. My fiancé and I are thin people, we had no problems, but if you are larger, I'm not sure how comfortable you'd be. I could have sworn I took a photo of the room when we arrived, but the only one I can find is with the two massage tables and our bed..that's the only reference I can provide. A big room to ant really necessary, you don't spend too much time inside.
Breakfast was lovely and light. Cereal, juice, coffee, pasteurized, salad, and everyday there was a special treat. It's wonderful!

I highly recommend this hotel. I enjoyed my experience immensely!",Date of stay: June 2017,Villa Ilias Caldera Hotel,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Wow! You Have To Try This!,"I booked a private fishing experience for my fiancé's birthday & we had a blast. I emailed Anthi 6 months ahead (yes, I'm a planner, and that is NOT required for this) and she was so great at emailing me back, answering my questions & providing lots of info.
A shuttle comes to pick you up from wherever you are and drives you to the port. Anthi meets you and brings you to the boat. It's a lovely boat! Much bigger than I expected. She offers drinks and puts out cookies to snack on.
You sail out to the traps and nets first. The traps are home made and are filled with beautiful red shrimp. You can help empty them if you want, we did of course.
When the nets come up, the real excitement happens. You see so many different fish and creatures! We caught an octopus, a squid, cuttlefish, a lobster, eels and loads of different fish.
Anthi uses nets that are fragile, that way. I dolphins get trapped, which I thought was pretty awesome.
Finally you can fish with poles, swim, snorkel, you're free to hang out and do your own things while the crew cleans and cooks everything. If she offers you fish soup, take it! It's lemony goodness.
There is something for everyone on these trips, and Anthi is so cute, intelligent and hospitable. I would take another trip with her in a heartbeat.

Oh! I forgot to mention. As I said, I booked this trip for my fiance's birthday. Anthi had her boyfriend bring a cake! She even had a candle for him to blow out and we got to sing to him!!! Unbelievable, she is so wonderful!",Date of experience: June 2017,Giorgaros fishing tours Santorini,1,"Santorini, Greece"
It's a beach,"There's nothing exciting going on here. You climb up and down a steep hill and there's the beach. The sand isn't red, just the wall of earth behind it.",Date of experience: June 2017,Red Beach,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Trip Advisor has led me astray - 👎🏽,"I don't understand how this could possible be so highly rated after our experience there.
We are staying in the Old Town in Kotor, and so we left the city walls and went left around the water to find this place. It was very highly rated & we were looking for something easy for dinner.
We walked in the front door & the place was filled with kids from the hostel, yelling, playing their instruments & enjoying themselves. There were about 5 people working behind the counter, and 2 other customers standing at the counter.
No one wanted to take our Oder, they didn't seem to care if we were there or not. If we finally got someone's attention, they would say 'the blonde lady' who cared about us the least of all.
They were out of the house specialty, so we ordered the first thing on the menu, because the descriptions are non-existent.
They gave us a small card with '21' on it and we went outside to sit in the garden. People were smoking everywhere- which is just what you have to live with here. My complaint is that literally every table was dirty. Dirty dishes, smears of food, it was disgusting.
It did take a while for our food to come, but it wasn't ridiculous or anything. I kept thinking, I'm going to be pleasantly surprised, this will be worth it.
It was pretty much a plate of different unidentifiable meets with some sauces. It was just ok. We ate some of it, but we weren't exactly enjoying ourselves.
A new batch of hostel people showed up and overtook the garden area, smoking and spreading their stuff around on all the tables, that was our cue to leave.
You go back inside to pay & again, getting anyone's attention is impossible.

Maybe we caught them on a bad day, but I'm not going to find out. There are plenty of other places nearby to try.",Date of visit: July 2017,Tanjga,1,"Kotor, Montenegro"
Choose another restaurant,"We were seated immediately, and sat for the better part of 10 minutes before anyone came to talk to us. Drinks took equally as long. We ordered the chicken hummus dip, hericot verts, and a pastrami sandwich. The dip was fine, but the chips were greasy as can be. The hericot Berta were just fine. The pastrami sandwich was not 'New York Deli Style' at all. My fiancé said, 'If you like a sparse pastrami sandwich, this one is for you. Not much meat, not much sauerkraut, not much meat.'
He got a whiskey smash, which was a bit weak, and our total bill was $57. Not terribly expensive for airport food, but all things considered, I would suggest another restaurant.",Date of visit: June 2017,Uptown Brasserie,1,"Jamaica, New York"
Absolutely Beautiful! (But not for the faint of heart),"Wow. This hike is challenging, but absolutely doable for any regular person. You climb up and down rocky terrain for a total of about 3 hours. The Waterfall is very cool (the highest in Iceland,) but for me the highlight was the views away from the falls. They were absolutely breathtaking.
I recommend hiking the loop. The views going up are wonderful. Then, on top of the Waterfall, you can cross the river and head down the other side of the mountain. This route isn't a scenic, (going down the other side) but it's a lot quicker and easier. Trust me, you'll be ready to get down quickly!
Pack plenty of water & wear layers. Choose a clear sunny day for this hike. It would be such a waste to put all the effort in for no views.",Date of experience: May 2017,Glymur,1,"Akranes, Iceland"
Delicious Authentic Chinese,"My Mother and I came to Denver to visit friends who moved to the US from China one year ago. They chose our dishes for us, which resulted in no General Tso's Chicken, that's for sure! We had fragrant jasmine tea, and lots of different food options, all of which were wonderful! We enjoyed Peking Duck, Deep Fried Shrimp Balls, Crab Meat & Fish Maw Soup, Sautéed Scallops With Mixed Vegetables, Oysters With Ginger & Scallion, Water Spinach With Shrimp Sauce, and dessert, some rice pudding that changed my life!
I took photos of everything we ate. The service was good, I think. They all seemed to speak English, but our friends ordered in Chinese.
I have included photos of all of our dishes.

I would recommend this place, absolutely!",Date of visit: May 2017,Star Kitchen,1,"Denver, Colorado"
Perfectly god hotel,"The staff was very friendly and breakfast was perfectly good. They had all the usual continental fare, bagels, eggs, sausage, yogurt, cereal and bagels. Among other things. It was a bit loud, you could hear a lot of traffic. It had a good location with a nice view. I would recommend this hotel",Date of stay: May 2017,Holiday Inn Express Denver Downtown,1,"Denver, Colorado"
"Reasonable, but not the cleanest","This hotel has very friendly staff and is up-to-date. The breakfast is very nice, with waffles, pancakes, eggs, sausage, cereal, bagels, yogurt and fruit.
My complaint is that my room wasn't cleaned with care. We stayed one night. When we arrived, we were exhausted and went right to sleep. Once I woke up, I found pieces of bacon in my bed....which I definitely didn't put there. The floor had clearly not been vacuumed, and as I walked around I kept getting crumbs and bits stuck to my feet. If it's your only option, it's definitely doable. But I might suggest giving another place a try.",Date of stay: May 2017,Best Western Plus Denver International Airport Inn & Suites,1,"Denver, Colorado"
Good experience for a business tirp,"I stayed here while attending an event nearby. It was a very large event, and I think we overwhelmed the staff. Everyone that I interacted with was kind and helpful. The rooms and clean and surprisingly large. I had a full sized refrigerator and silverware drawer, sink. everything you could need. The only reason this doesn't get the full five stars is because they had a bit of trouble keeping up with us at breakfast time. There were so many guests that they were running out of food and silverware. The breakfast was one of the better continental breakfasts that I've had. Eggs, meats, breads, yogurt, juices, oats. I liked it.
My boss was on the other side of the hotel and complained of a loud train going all night, so thats something to consider.",Date of stay: April 2017,Staybridge Suites Harrisburg,1,"Harrisburg, Pennsylvania"
Everything was fantastic- finally a restaurant that has it all!,"I went to G. Michael's with my fiancé for Valentine's dinner. We have eaten at our fair share of fine dining establishments in Columbus. The ambiance is good everywhere, but the food can sometimes be lacking. Our experience at G. Michael's was spectacular. Our server, David, was attentive, but let us enjoy our romantic evening.
We ordered the special appetizer, fried oysters. They were excellent, and we have eaten countless oysters!
For supper, Tom ordered the bone-in filet topped with foie gras, served with potatoes and green beans. He loved it!
I ordered the beet salad, which I loved, and the pheasant appetizer. It was one pheasant, halved and roasted. Very delicious!
For dessert we shared the brown sugar creme brulee, which was great.

Great place to stop after snorkeling,"My fiancé and I rode our bikes from the Sands for some snorkeling.

Fine dining in Provo,"My fiancé and I came here for a formal dinner, which we got. The staff were very attentive. We shared a bottle of prosecco and ordered escargot, which was delicious. For supper, Tom got the duck confit, which had great flavor, but he said the skin wasn't very crispy as promised. I got the tuna carpaccio, which was alright, but if you order it, ask for light olive oil. That's pretty much all I tasted. For dessert we shared a dessert sampler. The raspberry macaroon was very good, and so was the chocolate mousse.

"Good food, but expensive for what it is.","My fiancé and I stopped here on our drive down to Chalk Sound. We sat right in the sand, which was fabulous. Tom got a beer and I got a fruit smoothie. His beer wasn't as cold as he would have liked it, but my smoothie was. Tom got the grilled fish burger, which he enjoyed. I got the coconut crack conch which was delicious, especially with the mango sauce they serve it with. Total, tom had two beers, my one smoothie, and the two meals and out bill was $70. We though that was a lot.",Date of visit: May 2016,Bugaloo's,1,Providenciales

My crack conch was good too.",Date of visit: May 2016,Fresh Catch,1,Providenciales
Convenience is key,"This restaurant is on the grounds of our hotel. The fist meal we had there was a steak, which was good, and the conch chowder. I expected it to be white, like clam chowder. I would call it more of a stew. It wasn't bad. Next time we came for lunch. We got the fish burger which was good, and I got fish tacos, which didn't really blow my mind. They were fine. There is outdoor seating toward the beac which is probably nice, but we just sat at the bar while we ate.",Date of visit: May 2016,Hemingway's Restaurant,1,Providenciales
Definitely recommend this place for sunset dinner,"A woman at our hotel recommended we go here for dinner. We had 6:30 reservations, but it wasn't too busy yet, this was on a Friday night. We shared a Caesar salad, which was fine. The entrees were the stars of the show though. My fiancé got the veal scaloppine and he loved it. I got the portobello ravioli with a creamy red sauce which was AMAZING! We shared a tiramisu for dessert, which was good. The ambiance really sets the mood.
We actually returned there for dinner the following night, Saturday. This time Tom got a steak with peppercorn sauce, which he enjoyed and I got a pizza.
Now, the pizza I got didn't have too much flavor, but my toppings might not lend to that (you get four, I shove mushroom, tomato, basil and pineapple.) I recommend that if you get a pizza here, get exciting toppings or you might not be too in love with your pizza. It was good, but not flavorful.
The owner is buzzing around the restaurant, asking how everyone is doing, and explaining the features. He also gave me some bug spray to use. I didn't see any mosquitos, but I was already covered in sand flea bites, so I wanted to play it safe. It's a lovely place with a lovely view and good food.",Date of visit: May 2016,Baci Ristorante,1,Providenciales

I ordered the beef chimis and Tom ordered a pulled pork sandwich, and it was very very sweet, so if you don't like sweet pulled pork, skip that meal. My beef chimis were pretty alright.

We loved it!,"We did the sunset trek. Ricardo, from Chile, picked us up from our hotel and it was a 15 or 20 minute drive out to the monolith. It's so much more interesting up close! Ricardo told us a lot about the significance to the local people and a lot about the Outback in general. We had a great time, and we were lucky to get caught in one of the few rain storms they have at the Rock. We decided to skip the sunset part, as we were soaked. But Ricardo really didn't want to end the trip. He was out-voted though! It was tons of fun- just bring a fly net!

10 beers on tap,"Didn't try too many items. My dad got a beer flight, my mom got the Pinot Gris and loved it. I got the calamari & octopus. It was in an Asian sauce with cilantro. Not super filling, but very good.",Date of visit: December 2015,Pub on Wharf,1,"Queenstown, New Zealand"
It's fine,"We went at 3pm, there was still a line, but not too long. I ordered the little lamb burger. It had a mint sauce, which is why I ordered it, but there was a bbq tasting sauce that overwhelmed everything. The fries were really good though. It's fine. We went because of the hype- checked it off the list.",Date of visit: December 2015,Fergburger,1,"Queenstown, New Zealand"
It's perfectly good,"There is a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel, but you have to call and ask them to come- they do not run a circuit.
We had a misunderstanding with them, and even after calling it took an hour for us to see the shuttle. Keep that in mind next.
The hotel is nice though- decent breakfast and nice rooms",Date of stay: December 2015,Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,1,"Los Angeles, California"
"First Time Jet-Skiing, had a wonderful time","I have ALWAYS wanted to ride a jet ski, but I never had, so when my boyfriend wanted to visit Lake Erie, I was so excited. I don't know how we landed on this company, but we talked to Todd several times on the phone, and he is so friendly and helpful. If you don't know cedar point very well, thou, it can be tricky to find their location. You have to pay $15 for. Edgar point parking to get to them. They are located on the beach right behind the super tall tower ride.
We parked really far away accidentally, but the walk to find them wasn't terrible, because it was along the beach.
When we did find them, they signed us up and got us ready to go. 30 minutes was $85, but we went for an hour at $140. (We shared one jet-ski.)
They give you boundaries that you can ride round in, it's not gigantic, but it's plenty of space.it wasn't a busy day, so we had tons a freedom to ride around everywhere.
I don't have much jet-ski experience, but I am completely happy with what we did, I loved it!",Date of experience: August 2015,North Coast Parasail,1,"Sandusky, Ohio"
A million flavors,"Your standard ice cream. Loads of flavor options. My customer service experience was good. No outdoor seating, but it was perfect for curing my ice cream craving",Date of visit: August 2015,Toft's Ice Cream Parlor,1,"Port Clinton, Ohio"
I felt very cared about,"This is an old building, which means the rooms are small, but very clean feeling to me. Also, the water in the shower takes between 15 and 25 minutes to get hot (I'm not exaggerating at all) so plan ahead if you're in a hurry.
The breakfast is free, and you get what you pay for. During the week, it's almost exclusively carbs. Cereal, bagels, toast, oatmeal, etc. there was some yogurt and fruit though. On Saturday and Sunday mornings they have eggs, sausage and bacon. It runs from 6 to 10:30.
I got very ill during my visit and ended in the emergency room. The staff asked me how I was feeling every time they saw me, and (we had to switch rooms during our stay which was my fault) they got me in our new room immediately so I could rest, which was so nice. My boyfriend usually likes the nicest hotels. This isn't super fancy, but it has a good location and I enjoyed myself.",Date of stay: August 2015,The Island House Hotel,1,"Port Clinton, Ohio"
A lovely lunch,"As the rest of the reviews state, the drawing point of this restaurant is the lovely setting. It's right by the water and the ships and it's a very nice environment.
Amelia was our server, and she was sweet as pie. She recommended the crab cake sliders, and they were definitely my favorite part of our meal. We also got the drunken mussels, which were just fine, my boyfriend preferred the perch bites, which were pretty good. He loved the tartar sauce.",Date of visit: August 2015,Crabby Joe's Dockside,1,"Marblehead, Ohio"
"Wonderful place, but very close to the highway","My boyfriend and I stayed last night in room 1009. The room was very clean and modern. It was spacious and had tall windows, floor to ceiling. Great service, however the noise from e road could definitely be heard in our room. The higher the floor, the better off you'll be.",Date of stay: August 2015,"Le Meridien Columbus, The Joseph",1,"Columbus, Ohio"
A cool place to stop from out of town.,"This place is cool to visit, especially if you're not from Columbus. The ice cream is made of quality ingredients and they have unique flavors.
But if you live in this city and you're craving ice cream ( & you're not too snooty) I think a tub of ice cream works just as well & is way cheaper
It's a novelty to me- great taste, but sometimes oversold.",Date of visit: April 2014,Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams,1,"Columbus, Ohio"

I miss this store!! I wish we had one in Ohio.,"I used to go there twice a week when I lived in Hampton Beach, NH. They have clothes, guns, cold weather gear, home decor, I even donated blood there one time. The prices are average for what they sell- but it's a sight to see and there are lots of cool things to buy",Date of experience: November 2014,Kittery Trading Post,1,"Kittery, Maine"
"The fish I good, but bring your own bread","We stopped here before before going to the bull riding at Wesbanco Arena on Friday, March 20th 2015. We came there because it was highly rated on tripadvisor.

The restaurant is a fish market on one side and food counter with 2 lines on the other. One line is for their fish sandwhich, that they make tons of (must be good) and shell out to people.
The other line is for anything else, they make that to order. We got a Canadian whitefish sandwich (not the deluxe, which comes with a whole wheat kaiser bun,) fried oyster basket, jojo fries, and seafood chowder.
They have fountain drinks and bottles beverages. Ketchup, mustard and vinegar are free, but they charge 10 cents or so for cocktail and tartar.

The seafood chowder was very good.
The fries were thick cut, almost wedges and seasoned. Pretty good with vinegar.
The oysters were pretty alright. I'm an oyster fanatic though, so I may be picky.
The fish on the sandwich was excellent and plentiful. My only complaint is the bread, I guess I should have gone for the deluxe. It was just a piece of wonderbread, which soaked up moisture from the fish and became translucent. It subsequently attached to my teeth and roof of my mouth.

If I returned here, I would order the sandwich again, I would just bring better bread, and some lettuce and onion.

It was definitely a great deal though. With everything it only cost us $16.",Date of visit: March 2015,Coleman's Fish Market,1,"Wheeling, West Virginia"

A must see in Costa Rica,"My boyfriend and I did the hikes and were so pleased. It was $11 per person to enter the park and a short drive leads you to the parking at the mouth of the trail. The trail is very easy to walk- nice and flat. You walk through jungle and into an opening to the lava flows with have a fabulous view of the volcano.
After you take your time there you continue the trail to the Ceiba Tree that is HUGE! We found a cute little bat on it too. It probably took us between 2 & 3 hours to do the hike. It was laid back and relaxing, but the view of the volcano was exhilarating.",Date of experience: March 2015,Arenal Volcano,1,"Arenal Volcano National Park, Costa Rica"
I conquered my fear!!,"Wow! This was a big step for me. I really wanted to go through this cave, but I'm claustrophobic. Let me tell you honestly. At first, I was a little freaked out. There are a couple small holes to fit through, but 85% of the cave is big rooms. You go through shallow water most of the time, but it helped relax me, it's nice and warm in the cave and the water is slightly cool. It's refreshing. The guide was so nice and patient. He let me go at my own pace and as far as I was willing to go. They province boots and helmets. My boyfriend had a hard time with his helmet fitting his head, it kept coming loose. The boots are t so bad, but water shoes might be better. There are a lot of stones though, I wouldn't recommend those strappy hiking sandals.

We saw some scorpion spiders (which aren't as big or scary as I thought) we saw tons of bats, and loads of cave crickets. It was beautiful, I'm so glad we did it.
It was $22 per person. We added the photographer for an extra $20 & I'm so glad we did. Everything is gonna get wet, so I didn't want to take my camera in the cave.
We were the only two people on our tour, which was really nice.
