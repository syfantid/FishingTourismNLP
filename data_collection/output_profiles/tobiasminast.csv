The trip of the dreams,"This amazing family gave us the possibility to experience a unforgettable day full of emotions, happiness and amazing traditional Greek food. This trip included everything starting from fishing your own food over seeing the most amazing places of santorini, taking a bath in clear water like a pool, getting freshly made very tasty food and ended with wonderful live music. I just can say thank you Kuriakos, Antonis and Vetta - I will never forget this trip.",Date of experience: August 2020,Flora Fishing Tours,5,"Santorini, Greece"
