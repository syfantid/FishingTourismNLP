Unique experience in Milos,"We had a very special day in Nikos and Froso's boat, traveling around the Polyegos island famous for the turquoise waters and caves.
Watching real fishing with nets and preparing the lunch with the fish catch was an experience you cannot imagine.
They were very friendly and created a warm atmosphere during the day trip sharing also secrets of fishing.
