Food was also very good and one of the nicest steaks I’ve had in a while.

"Booked a table, but forced to sit outside","Booked a table a week before but when we arrived we were informed we would need to sit outside scorching heat as they had forgot to assign us a table. This was despite booking in person at the pub the week before. When we were seated outside, one of the tables then broke causing food and drink to be spilled. Food was okay but not comfortable eating in the heat we experienced that day. To top it off, the bill was messed up at the end resulting in an overcharge. This was put right when challenged again at the bar. Poor customer service.",Date of visit: August 2020,Hunters Lodge Inn,4,"Axminster, United Kingdom"
