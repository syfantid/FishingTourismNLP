Brilliant trip,"Spend 4 hours on a Sunday morning on this fishing trip was a highlight of the holiday , from start to finish I had a great time , there was one couple and also a father and son on it with me mine decided to stay at the pool with his mum lol , the help from the skipper and his mate was brilliant (forgot their names) few hours fishing then they barbecued the catch it was served up with the freshest salad I’ve ever tasted An the fish was unreal , while it was cooking you could snorkel or just chill with a beer (which I did) then it was back to the harbour , without doubt this would be the first trip booked when I get back to Rhodes ,thanks guys",Date of experience: June 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"

"Family fun ,","Stayed 2 weeks from the 6th of June ,this was our 3rd visit here as a family 2 adults and a 5 year old boy ,on arrival we were given a room upgrade,all the staff at reception were very pleasant and a pleasure to deal with ,rooms are spotless ,towels changed every day and cleaned , our room overlooked the adults pool and got the sun in the evening 6210,The outside grounds are kept spotless ,
Food was great and we ate at all the restaurants even going up to Cala verde which was nice but had to be booked in reception,Pier the manager of the restaurants in Cala blanca is a credit to the hotel always a smile and a hello for everybody even remembered us from our previous visits , the bars are well stocked with branded drinks but a bit of a wait sometimes to get a drink ,all the bar staff were friendly and cheerful and special thanks to Jenny who looked after us and our wee boy so well ,
Outside of the hotel just up the road there is a small Italian restaurant which we ate in a few times food was brilliant and a nice treat away from the hotel at the beach there is also a hostel which serves food and drinks at a reasonable cheap price and of good quality ,and below the hotel is las dalias also nice for a cocktail or food at reasonable prices , there is also a couple of shops selling everything you'd need for your holidays ,
The beach we used a couple of times and was nice would be better if the hotel had their own sun loungers but hey you can't have everything ! There's mini club & maxi club for the kids our boy only went twice but had a fab time with Ester & Julia and the other girls who do a brilliant job at mini club !!
There's several pools at this hotel ,pirate splash pool ,adults only pool ,quieter pool at reception and at the bottom pool is where all the activity happens during the door and this is the part where I come to about the animation team ! These guys & girls work there socks off to help and make everybody's holiday that little bit better I've never met a bunch of nicer people in my life ,from Martin who is the leader and all the rest of the team it's the reason we come back every year to this place !!There's archery,table tennis ,aqua aerobics,yoga,water polo ,darts ,beach volleyball plus numerous other games and fun stuff like mr Cala blanca ,champagne games to do during the day (if that's your thing).in the evening from half 8 it's mini disco ( the bar at the reception pool have live music some nights)then after they have the diploma awards for who ever has won the various games during the day ,after that it's show time the best ones being the animation teams own shows which are brilliant ! I even took part in one my self as it was my birthday ! A big big thanks to Martin ,Ester,Julia,Dominik,Albert,George,Daniele,Dirk,Adrian,Josephine and anybody else I've missed for making our holiday one we won't forget ,
Will we go back next year ? ...without doubt can't wait, see you all then",Date of stay: June 2016,Invisa Hotel Club Cala Blanca,4,"Ibiza, Spain"
"fun in the sun ,but not for some!","stayed from 11-14th September with a large group of friends to celebrate a special occasion rooms were clean and basic but with no aircon,food was good with plenty of variety,all branded drinks were served in the hotel bar the pool area was clean at all times with lovely views.The hotel staff were all friendly.On arrival we all paid 50 euro each which was returned to us all on departure after our rooms had been inspected for damages of which there was none .As with all large groups of people on holidays they can become loud and have a bit of fun be it a sing song or throwing someone in the pool but to be described as intimidating and then good humoured at the same time doesn't make sense, which is it??? We met lots of people at this hotel from Belfast,scotland,dublin,england so maybe our company wasn't so bad after all.If its a basic hotel with good food an drink then this is a good place ,if its bingo,ballroom dancing and a cup of tea or a glass of sherry I would suggest brighton or blackpool.Would I go back ? certainly !",Date of stay: September 2015,Club Santa Ponsa,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Family fun holiday !!!,"What a place ! From start to finish it was superb ,stayed for 2 weeks from 18th June ,this was our second time here 2 adults and a 4 an half year old boy ,and it didn't disappoint.Our room was overlooking the pool at reception ,it was cleaned and tidied every morning .
Food was excellent in all restaurants,the marina had to be booked day before and also the BBQ at Cala Verde (the top sister hotel) but all worth it especially the views from both ,
All branded drinks were available in the bars.
There's a mini club( an a maxi) which is brilliant if mum & dad want a bit of time together ,very well organised and 100% safe ,face painting ,games, swimming pool , usual stuff ,beside that was also a large pirate ship pool with slides and waterfalls,
There was lots of adult activities to do from rifle shoot,darts,water polo,paella demo,sangria demo all good fun,
In the evening was the mini disco,movies by the pool,night time show ,usually put on by the animation team ,and late disco some nights ,
The beach was only a few steps away with plenty of sun loungers and parasols which you had to pay for but didn't cost much .
Biggest thanks has to go to the animation team these guys & girls worked so hard to put on shows ,games,look after the kids and adults they really made the holiday ,Amber,Daf,yoann,Esther ,lupo and lastly Rafa who made my boys holiday so special and anybody else I've forgot thanks again and see you all next year .",Date of stay: May 2015,Invisa Hotel Club Cala Blanca,4,"Ibiza, Spain"
Brilliant first family holiday!!,"This was our first family holiday with our child nearly 4 ,couldn't have picked a better place , stayed for 10 nights from 19th June,food was great and lots of variety , same with the drinks ,the kids entertainment and adults was great fun for all during the day and later at night ,out of the 3 pools (ship,walk in ,bottom) the bottom pool suited us the most because there was more going on ie water polo,darts,all the usual stuff ,only complaint is that any white on your shorts/bikini turned yellow after a while in the water ! Must have something to do with the water treatment but don't worry it washes out at home .
Couple of shops nearby selling everything you'd need ,nice beach with plenty of sun loungers (15euro) .
All in all a great place for a family holiday with children ,and big thanks to the animation team who make the place even better !!
That good we will be back next year for 2 weeks ,,",Date of stay: June 2014,Invisa Hotel Club Cala Blanca,4,"Ibiza, Spain"
