No big expectations,I am visiting this restaurant for many years. This time the quality was not as before. I am very sorry to say that I will not recommend it any more as Top french restaurant. It is good for a quick lunch or dinner but have no big expectations.,Date of visit: October 2019,Mon Plaisir,4,"London, United Kingdom"

Divine view and taste,"When visit this cafe for breakfast you have to be prepared for the extraordinary! The fantastic plates, the quality, the service and the view invites you to stay there the whole day. Mrs Labrini, orchistrates a serene atmosphere in pale blue and romantic flowers, very Greek and Santorinian. The horizon is filled with the Volcano and athe right you can see Oia behind the square shadow of the theatening rock of Skaros. All in one. The smell of ground coffee togetther with fresh local marmelades, vegan recipies....Well.No more.Go and see.",Date of visit: June 2019,Galini Cafe,4,"Santorini, Greece"

Unforgetable experience,Celebrating my sons birthday we have chosen the fishing tour. As Greeks we found this genuine and unique. It reminds me my fathers fishing nights. Anthi and her team are immaculate. Anthi is not only born as a Mermaid but she holds a Masters degree in Political philosophy and a long family history in Restaurants. Her physical nobility and warmth makes your day THE SUMMER DAY IN SANTRINI’ S PARADISE,,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
"Nice environment, Dissapponting diiner","The oysters were very nice The rest of the dinner was not great. The platter with the dips overpriced Stale focacia. The main dish Bavette with mushrooms and onions was served cold with only one mushroom! When we’ve asked for the dessert, we were informed that the kitchen was closed. Many apologies , discount and a glass of wine did not made us happier.",Date of visit: June 2018,Boundary Rooftop,4,"London, United Kingdom"
