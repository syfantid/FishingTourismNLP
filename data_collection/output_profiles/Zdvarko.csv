A wonderful expeience,"While our visit was not purely for pleasure, and was oriented more towards familiarising ourselves with the fishing tourism practices in Kefalonia, it still managed to provide a wonderful field trip, where we got to experience everything Michalis, Antonia and Hassan normally offer to tourists.
Tourists normally visiting fishing villages and similar places generally don't have the opportunity to see fishing gear in actual operation, so the chance to first-hand experience lifting and setting of gillnets onboard the vessel, and see the daily catch lifted directly from the sea really provides a great experience. This is only improved with the delicious lunch offered on board, prepared straight from the net.
All in all, I can only readily recommend this experience to anyone interested in artisanal fishery experience combined with a quality meal.",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
