Excellent value for money,"This place is rather new, but has a great location, lovely owners and a free bicycle to go into town. Staff was very helpful in recommending us transfers, tours and best spots in Hoi an. We definitely enjoyed our stay and recommend others to give it a try.",Date of stay: September 2015,Riverside Oasis Villa,5,"Hoi An, Vietnam"
