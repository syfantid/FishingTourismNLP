Summertime visit,"The Headingly Lodge is a lovely hotel, rooms are nicely furnished and spacious. The staff are really friendly and helpful.
The only downside of our visitthis time was the heat. There is no airconditioning so you have to rely on open windows which can be noisey with the planes. Also worth noting that the cafe isn't open at the weekend, so you need to go into Headingly for breakfast. Apart from that, a good place to stay.",Date of stay: July 2019,Headingley Lodge,4,"Headingley, United Kingdom"
A great change from usual boat trips!,"The best bit about the trip is that there are only 10 people at a time, which makes it far more friendly and fun than some of the other boat trips on offer (100+ people). Antonio was a great captain, very patient with those who hadn't fished before. The trip we were on was 4 hours and we fished, swam and had a lovely lunch of fish, salad and bread, Oh not to forget the beers! All in all a great way to spend a morning!",Date of experience: July 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
a great place to stay,"The Ascot Grange is a really friendly hotel, just on the outskirts of Leeds City. Loads of parking, clean and comfortable rooms and super staff.The Indian restaurant on site is lovely too. The common areas could do with a bit of attention but overall, very good value for money",Date of stay: May 2019,Ascot Grange Hotel,4,"Headingley, United Kingdom"
Ascot Grange,"a well placed hotel in Headingly. Staff really friendly, rooms good size and very clean. Communal areas need a bit of TLC but understand this is due to happen soon. Although on a main road, have never been bothered by traffic noise. A couple of eateries a short walk away.",Date of stay: January 2018,Ascot Grange Hotel,4,"Headingley, United Kingdom"
Good value,"Hotel is well situated, clean and the staff very friendly. The rooms are spacious and beds comfortable. Breakfast is very good value too. Only negative is that the communal areas could do with a bit of updating, but otherwise it's all good",Date of stay: March 2017,Ascot Grange Hotel,4,"Headingley, United Kingdom"
Great weekend break,"Bruges is a beautiful city, easy to walk round and is a great place for a weekend break. The buildings, canals, shops and parks are lovely. Lots to see and do. The short canal boat ride is good value and the view from the top of the clock tower magnificent. Best to eat off the square as it's more expensive there but there are plenty of good restaurants a few minutes walk away.",Date of stay: September 2016,Hotel Boterhuis,4,"Bruges, Belgium"
