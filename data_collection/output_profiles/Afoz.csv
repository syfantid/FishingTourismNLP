"Quiet, relaxing family holiday","We stayed at the Astra Village Suites for 7 nights with our two boys aged 11 and13. Before arriving I had arranged excursions with the staff on Reception, who couldn’t have been more helpful. On arrival in Svoronata we were pleased that the transfer was literally 5/10 minutes as the hotel was fairly close to the run way. This was certainly not a problem as you might expect it was great fun watching the planes come in and out. They didn’t run late or through the night either. The room was large and spacious and spotlessly clean as was the rest of the hotel. We ate in at Elia in the hotel most evenings but walked 5 minutes towards the beach to O Miles and Ammes Beach Club to eat on a couple of evenings. The area is quiet with a couple of mini markets, car rental, several restaurants and the beach. It’s great if you want to unwind and relax. There is a bus stop 5 minutes away where you can catch regular buses to Argostoli and Lassi. The breakfast was varied and plentiful served 7.30-10 each day. The thing that we noticed most about Astra was how friendly and accommodating the staff were. It definitely made us was to return next year!",Date of stay: August 2018,Astra Village Hotel & Suites,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely Seafood,"We visited O Milos win our two boys who both enjoy seafood. We weren’t disappointed. Upon arrival it was very busy and so rather than sitting outside we had to sit inside, which was fine. The manager came over to tell us about the swordfish specials and wanted to show us the fish that he’d caught that day. We ordered two swordfish specials, tuna steak and a sea bream. My son is 11 and loves fish but they are often served whole in Kefalonia so we requested the sea bream to be filleted which they explained may take a bit longer. The waiting time for food and drinks was quite long but the food was tasty and the restaurant was very busy so understandable. When we asked for the bill the manager promptly came over with raki for my husband and I and ice cream for the children. I would definitely recommend a visit if you’re in Svoronata.",Date of visit: August 2018,O Milos,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Beautiful Food Great Staff!,"We visited Elia Restaurant, which was attached to ‘The Astra Village Suites’ in Svoronata, 5/7 of our nights in Kefalonia. They serve a lovely mix of traditional Greek vegetable, fish and meat dishes. We always found something different and delicious for our children (11 and 13) and ourselves to eat. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, it’s a family business and it shows. Alcohol is a little bit expensive, 6 Euros for a martini and lemonade or 8 Euros for an Aperol Spritz. We would recommend the pork tenderIoin! Definitely worth a whilst you’re in Svoronata!",Date of visit: August 2018,ELIA RESTAURANT,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic Day out !,"We took the fishing tour with our two children (11 and 13) it was an early start. Antonio very kindly picked us up at 7.40 as we were in Svoronata. The day started with drinks and sailing out to put out the nets and to bring in the nets for the days catch. We couldn’t believe our eyes - huge crabs, lobster, star fish and a scorpion fish. We stopped at Pessada Beach to swim, which was just beautiful whilst Antonio and Michaelis made lunch with the fresh catch. We ate salad, potato salad, lobsters, crab and lobster spaghetti. It was the best food I’d tasted. It was a brilliant day - I’d definitely recommend it to anyone coming to visit Kefalonia!",Date of experience: July 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Amazing Tapas,"We booked our table by email the night before after checking out the reviews on here. There was a bit of a mix up and the booking wasn’t in the diary but the waiter found us a table within a few minutes. It was busy and there were people waiting at the bar so I’d definitely recommend booking. We weren’t sure about the menu as only certain things had tapas at the side, the waiter explained that everything was tapas. We had the bravas, meatballs, pork loin (which was cured meat on bread), cod and Spanish omelette. Everything was delicious we couldn’t finish. Sangria is the best I’ve tasted! We will definitely return...",Date of visit: April 2018,Bodega Vasconia,4,"Barcelona, Spain"
So relaxing!,"My husband and I visited Aire de Barcelona at 3.00pm in the afternoon after a long morning touring Barcelona. Like some of the reviews said, the changing room staff don’t speak any English but they are pleasant and you can get by. They supply footwear, robes and towels. Everywhere is very quiet and they remind you to be quiet within the spa. Once changed you are led downstairs to the spa area, which had very dim ambient lighting with relaxing music, which was just delightful.There was a hot stone area to relax with water or mint tea. There was a large jacuzzi, steam, cold, tepid and hot baths, salt bath for floating, which was so relaxing. After about an hour we were met by a lovely masseuse who escorted us upstairs for our massage. It was a room with two massage tables as it was a couples visit. It was completely silent apart from the music and was the best massage I’ve had. After the massage, we were able to go back to use the baths again. After the most relaxing afternoon we went to shower, which had loccitane shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. The changing rooms were great too: loccitane body lotion, hairdryers and straightners. We were so completely rejuvenated afterwards and will definitely return!",Date of experience: April 2018,AIRE Ancient Baths,4,"Barcelona, Spain"
"Great location, thin walls!","We stayed for two nights on the fifth floor. The staff were helpful and spoke good English. Breakfast was 9 euros and was basic but tasty. The location was fantastic, just off Las Ramblas with bars, restaurants, the harbour etc all within walking distance. The room was clean and the twin beds were very comfortable. The first night we slept well and didn’t know what most reviews meant when they said about the noise. On the second night we found out!! Our neighbours were so loud it was like being in the same room as their conversation and we could hear the television like we were next to it. This was
a big downside for us and the reason I would probably not rebook.",Date of stay: April 2018,Hotel Barcelona House,4,"Barcelona, Spain"
Beautiful hotel!,"We stayed with our two teenage boys and had two interconnecting rooms. We couldn’t believe how much space we had. Considering it was February the rooms were lovely and warm. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, always happy to provide directions, advice and book taxis. One evening we didn’t know where to eat, Massimo in Reception swiftly booked us a table at the home of fettuccini and the taxi was there in minutes. The breakfast was delicious and varied. We couldn’t work the coffee machine so some instructions might have helped. The addition of free coffee and tea in the lobby was a welcome addition after a long day walking. A great stay- we would definitely recommend K. boutique!",Date of stay: February 2018,The K Boutique Hotel,4,"Rome, Italy"
Fantastic - great food/great service!,"We have bread and more many times, both this year and last year! My children love to visit Soner, the owner who ensures that they have great fun from fireworks and lollipops to Chinese lanterns. The food is lovely I would recommend the sizzling lamb !",Date of visit: July 2013,East Meets West,4,"Kalkan, Turkey"
Fantastic food and very friendly !,"We ate at Bread or More countless times, in fact the children were begging to go! Soner (the owner) was so welcoming and was always finding something fun for the kids to do from making cocktails, to fireworks and card tricks! I would recommend the sizzling lamb, it was absolutely delicious and the presentation was fab- still on fire was how my son put it! My husband was also happy here as he got to watch the English football and I was happy with the fab cocktails- apple martini was my favourite ! Can't wait to visit again next year - thank you Soner!!!",,East Meets West,4,"Kalkan, Turkey"
