Beautiful new hotel - Excellent staff,"The hotel is new, the rooms are super clean, the swimming pool on top floor really nice (if the water on the pool was warmer, it would be perfect). Breakfast is optional and rich, you have to wait more local foods than international products. Above all, the staff is very very polite, ready to help you anytime and for anything you need. Special thanks to Aim (the lady on front desk)... she did her very best to assist us during our stay with useful tips and a big smile :)",Date of stay: January 2019,The Quarter Ari by UHG,1,"Bangkok, Thailand"

Top traditional experience,"If you like to spend some hours with the pure local people (fisherman + his wife) doing an unusual super experience.. this is for you!

Perfection!,"One of the best sushi in the world we have ever tasted! It was the second time we visited Cartagena and Tabetai and we were wondering if the quality was the same as two years later. We realized that quality is getting better and better in this small restaurant. If you visit this town, come here directly!!!",Date of visit: February 2016,Tabetai Sushi Bar,1,"Cartagena, Colombia"
Average,"We visited this restaurant because some people said they have nice sushi. Unfortunately, once we arrive there was no salmon, no tuna.. almost nothing! We tried some other dishes but the value was under average. We asked to pay by card, but they don't accept. In our opinion, there some better restaurants nearby.",Date of visit: January 2015,Puggo's,1,"Montezuma, Costa Rica"
Excellent Italian food,"We stayed 10 days in puerto Viejo and, as fan of Italian cuisine, we tried food in a lot Italian restaurants there. We truly recommend ""Todos es Possible"", the pasta was more than super, red wine really good and pizza was delicious! We appreciate the correct and fare prices, the value for money is pretty good (most of the rest Italian restaurants in Puerto Viejo charge one plate of pasta 20-25 USD and the quality is average). Danillo (the owner of the ""Todos.."" restaurant) and his family do a great job! We wish to be back soon.",Date of visit: January 2015,Todo es Posible,1,"Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, Costa Rica"
A small paradise!,"We changed 2 hotels in Puerto Viejo before we stay in Blue Conga. We were lucky that we find this family-operated hotel, just 3 minutes away from the center. It's located in a very quiet place, full of nature!! The French owners are really polite and ready to give any help you might need. The overall value for money is really great!

Stefanie & Eric, thank you for everything and hope to see you in Greece soon.",Date of stay: January 2015,Hotel Blue Conga,1,"Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, Costa Rica"

Just perfect!,"This small property is located in a magic place with a breathless panoramic sea view. This is the best place to relax, listen the sea and read a book! Our room was very nice and clean as well, very comfortable for two people.

The whole experience was fabulous, it's something that I definitely recommend for couples!!",Date of stay: June 2013,Vigla Studios,1,"Milos, Greece"
