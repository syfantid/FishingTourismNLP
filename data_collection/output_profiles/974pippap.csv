This is our go to restaurant in Ely now..,"Always a wonderfully warm welcome and always very accommodating. The food is great and plenty of it - I enjoy trying new dishes and the staff are always on hand to suggest what to choose. Yes its always busy so suggest booking at peak times, but they will always fit you in if they can. Atmosphere is great and always end up chatting to other diners in there - a happy contented, full bellied bunch can always be found here ! Well done guys and keep up the good work .",Date of visit: December 2019,Ely Turkish Restaurant & Meze Bar,4,"Ely, United Kingdom"
Excellent food service ambiance,"We visited twice this weekend , once for a drink and snack and couldn’t resist going back for dinner the following night . We were looked after superbly by Dragos both times ! Friendly , professional and very attentive he is a great asset to the restaurant . The food and drink were superb and well presented , I believe the chefs are award winners and it shows . Well done and keep up the good work . Perfectly placed by the harbour and building and decor beautiful . A must visit whilst in beautiful Whitby .",Date of visit: November 2019,The Star Inn The Harbour,4,"Whitby, United Kingdom"
Shambolic service good food,We visited last night as a table of 17 and were very excited to experience something a bit different . Restaurant was busy and staff very friendly - but the 2 waiters ( 1 new)and 1 overworked bar member were completely run off their feet and it showed . unfortunately service was shockingly slow and disorganised - it felt like they were short staffed - until we were told it was a normal night for them . They did their best and hats off to Nino who was friendly and knowledgable and did his best but we all came away wondering why the management think that amount of staff is acceptable ! Because of this our drinks order and service were really slow and mistakes were made . Salad bar was amazing though and the food great - although most people were full before the different varieties were served so didn’t get to experience anything other than steaks - felt they should be mixed up a bit more from the start .. A disappointing night at what should be a gem of a restaurant . All down to lack of staffing numbers and not the staff themselves ..,Date of visit: November 2019,Estabulo Rodizio Bar & Grill - Harrogate,4,"Harrogate, United Kingdom"
Amazing Fishing Trip with Wonderful Hosts,"We cannot praise these people and their trip highly enough ! This is a wonderful authentic experience which provides fun, fishing , sunsets and oh so much more .. This is a must do experience and is totally different to any others you will see - trust us .. Antoni and his father were the best hosts and gave a truly interesting insight to fishing on the Island . Their genuine warmth and hospitality will want you coming back for more. We will remember this trip always - thank you and well done from The Pearson’s .",Date of experience: August 2019,Flora Fishing Tours,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Simply Wonderful,"We visited here for 10 nights in Feb 2018 and found the whole experience wonderfully perfect. We stayed in a Delux Sunset Water Villa by the Vui Bar and loved it. We spent every day on our new favourite hobby snorkelling and saw some amazing fish, Rays,sharks and turtles just by swimming out to the reef's edge ! We highly recommend investing in your own full face masks - these made such a difference to our experience as we'd never got on with normal masks before. Beware the current can be pretty strong though so wear life jackets. Big thanks to Rock who looked after us on the turtle quest trip- we managed to swim with 5 turtles and what an amazing experience.. Onto our other favourite pastime - eating and drinking .... We found every restaurant lovely but our favourite was the Italian .Have to mention Sheena at this point as she looked after us so well on every visit - often going above and beyond in her customer service..The waiters and bar staff were very attentive - especially the lovely Lovely, Don and Arif. We paid extra for the AI gold plus option and found it well worth it for us as we like to drink .also not having to pay extra in the restaurants for anything there's- 22.5% tax on anything outside of your AI package but we didn't have to worry about that. Also entitled us to free massages in the spa ,which we would use anyway,made it a great option for us . All in all a great resort, run very well and we had a lovely restful time on a beautiful island..we'd definitely return.",Date of stay: February 2018,Centara Ras Fushi Resort & Spa Maldives,4,Male
Christmas Break,"We have just come home from a 5 night stay with our dog - yes they are wonderfully dog friendly (although who couldn't love a pug?!).... Room was perfect for us, a great size considering the limits they had when converting this beautiful old Infirmary into a hotel. What made our stay all the more lovely was the staff , everyone was so helpful and friendly - from those on the front desk, to the Bistro staff and last but not least the bar staff... I must mention Dominic at this point because he was so professional, friendly and actually a very interesting guy to chat to! Nothing was too much trouble - he is a great asset to your business . Also we cant leave out Rose who again was very attentive and friendly - well done both. As with other reviews, the parking was a bit of an issue but looking at the site there really doesn't seem to be anywhere they could build more parking. The nearest carpark is only over the road but - as with other hotels we have stayed in with similar issues - the hotel could make some sort of concession to help with the charges. Would definitely recommend this hotel though, great Xmas had by all.",Date of stay: December 2017,Hotel du Vin Exeter,4,"Exeter, United Kingdom"
BEST HOTEL IN PATONG,"Can I give this a 10 out of 5 star rating ?? We were staying in the ocean wing with clubhouse included.. yes we are up the hill a bit and yes we use the buggy service but it is no issue and so very quick to arrive . They have this and every service down to a fine art - probably due to a great management team and lovely friendly happy staff here.. we have stayed in top hotels and this is on par - pound for pound with them (and much cheaper).. huge thanks have to go to Pierre the resort manager who has made my husbands birthday celebration one to remember - feeling very spoiled by everyone thank you ! special mention goes to all the wonderful staff at The Clubhouse - especially Sornchai who is just lovely - attentive, friendly and a credit to the hotel - well done and thank you again.. must also mention the beds - most comfortable bed we've ever slept in .. and the pillows !!the hotel is just out of the main hustle bustle of Patong - just up the hill - quick to walk in or a tuk tuck is always on hand - pay no more that 200 Baht tho ! Beautiful views, beautiful hotel and not too dear .. highly recommend this place .",Date of stay: February 2017,Amari Phuket,4,"Phuket, Thailand"
Great Location,"Nice hotel, great location - 5 mins walk to skytrain (BTS) and Terminal 21 shopping precinct. Nice room, bit tired, great view of pool and hotels. Pool is nice - a much needed asset after trawling around the city in stifling heat! Same goes for the SPA - had a lovely swedish massage and facial in their special offer package - and not too pricey either.. Saying that there is a great massage parlour just down the street which does fantastic massages ( we called in for a 250 BAHT foot massage at 10pm after a long tiring day and got basically a whole body massage chucked in as standard!). I agree with other reviews that the drinks were pricey - but this is a hotel so expected really. Staff ok, no real service given - almost impersonal to be honest but this is a busy city hotel so no real surprise .Breakfast was very good but busy and the staff seemed overworked and again no real service given.I'd recommended it there but wasn't blown away .",Date of stay: February 2017,Rembrandt Hotel & Suites Bangkok,4,"Bangkok, Thailand"
Perfect introduction to Mexico.. Best all round All Inclusive Resort Ive been to.,"We stayed as a couple from 13th - 23rd April in block 4 overlooking the pool area and had a wonderful time. Room was perfect - great size and the bed was so comfy. There is a huge main pool which is very lively and a great place to hang around in and chat and drink , but there are several quieter pools around the main pool which we preferred.. All are serviced but a great bunch of waiters - always there ready for your next round of cocktails.. Must mention Felipe - our honorary cockney geezer ! Always great fun and very attentive. Cheers mate ;-) The entertainment staff are great fun and not in your face.. Try the bingo at 4pm - soo funny... The Spa was beautiful and we had 2 lovely massages - the swedish massage was the best I've had. We used the therapy circuit on a number of days and loved it each time.. I was quite poorly for most of my time there and had to see the in house doctor... I have to mention Hose at this stage because we felt he helped us out the most and always went to extra mile.. A lovely man too - thank you Hose! There seem to be a few mixed reviews about the restaurants... I have been to many all inclusives and have usually had the buffet as the main evening meal - unless you book in early to their restaurants. Here there is no evening buffet and a choice of 6 or 7 restaurants instead where there is no pre booking. If you have to wait its never more than 10 minutes and you can grab a pre dinner drink at the lobby bar so no problem. The food was lovely in the main but we felt the best one was Ratatouille .. The staff are great fun, very attentive and the mediterrainian food was to die for! Weirdly it was never busy and we felt people were missing out on this little gem.. It is used as the World Cafe during the day and is the farthest away in the corridor so maybe people don't realise it is there - but it is a must try.. All in all the resort is gorgeous,very clean , the staff are great and the food plentiful -Coco cafe is open 24 hours! Would highly recommend ..",Date of stay: April 2016,Secrets Silversands Riviera Cancun,4,"Puerto Morelos, Mexico"
WONDERFUL HOTEL IN A BEAUTIFUL LOCATION,"We spent 5 days here as the 3rd and final island hotel stay in Thailand. All 3 were very different but we felt all in all this was our favourite - and was actually the cheapest. The resort is lovely and built well to blend into the National park - well done. The beach was lovely and clean - contrary to a few other previous reports. Resutarants were fine but we preferred to get out and about in Ao Nang, eat a bit cheaper and see some of the Thai life. Again, contrary to some previous reports it is fairly easy to get over the monkey trail ( after the initial journey to be fair!). It is steep and rickety but - for us it only added to its quaintness.. but I do appreciate this is not suitable for everyone but im not very fit and I got used to it and decided not to bother with the boats and tuk tuk (we missed every boat home due to having too much fun in Ao Nang!).Staff were very helpful and pleasant and nothing too much trouble. One downside however was the housekeeping. We were greeted with crackers and dips in the room on arrival - very nice , but instead of the dish etc being taken away the next morning it was left on our doorstep for 2 days until we complained the beach bar manager who was very good and got it removed immediately. Lots of toiletries in the room but we had to chase to get most of them replenished on most days. All that said, we had a very lovely stay - and the monkeys were an added bonus for us - how often do you get to feed fruit to monkeys on your balcony ? ( sorry - bit naughty!). Great stay - thank you David and staff we can highly recommend your hotle - and have!",Date of stay: February 2016,Centara Grand Beach Resort & Villas Krabi,4,"Ao Nang, Thailand"
50th birthday trip,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we were waved goodbye by our GEM Bo we had a fantastic experience. We spent 5 nights here and wren bowled over by the friendliness of the staff and Thai people in general. Room and plunge pool (swimming pool really it was so big! ) were gorgeous and well thought out. The hotel pool was lovely with great views - in fact the whole resort was beautiful. The managers were visible and friendly, ensuring we had everything we needed and more. Breakfast was plentiful and very tasty . Special thanks to our GEM Bo who we wanted to take home with us ! Professional, courteous, cheerful and smiley - oh so smiley! One tip, whilst Choweng beach is a must to visit - go to Fishermans Village for a more upmarket scene.. Bars, beachfront restaurants, market,shops etc and no=icer than Cowing in our opinion.",Date of stay: February 2016,Six Senses Samui,4,"Bophut, Thailand"
Wonderful Wedding in a wonderful setting,"Us and our family of 7 spent a week in August (21st-29th) for our wedding. We could not have chosen a better place to get married - its a beautiful resort. We had 3 beachfront rooms and they were perfect. All the staff were very attentive and the service from the Wedding Planners was wonderful, they saw to our every need not only for our big day but throughout the week - nothing was too much trouble. We held our ceremony in the gardens rather than on the beach as it was much more private - we felt the beach area was too public - and it didn't disappoint! We had the most fantastic week ,the food was lovely ,restaurants good and the entertainment great ( different groups singing every night and all really good). A special mention goes out to Jean Marie who goes that extra mile to look after you and cater to your every whim. He is a credit to Awali and made our holiday even more special - every resort needs a Jean Marie! big thanks again from Mr and Mrs Pearson !!!",Date of stay: August 2014,Heritage Awali Golf & Spa Resort,4,Mauritius
Disappointing menu,"Beautiful building inside and out . restaurant offered for 1 night of your stay and food part of your all inclusive but not drinks. However,the menu was only free in part - the best food needed paying for - and what was offered free was on the whole awful and we went away very disappointed as we had made this our special treat night . We'd wished we had eaten in Balafon to be honest.",Date of visit: August 2014,Heritage Le Chateau,4,Mauritius
"Stunning Resort - stunning service, beautiful people","We spent our Honeymoon week 29th Aug - 5th Sept at this wonderful resort and we could not have chosen a more perfect place to relax and celebrate. The resort is beautiful, well maintained and every detail thought of. The food is gorgeous - especially the Al A Carte breakfasts and the staff are attentive,thoughtful and remember not only your name but what you like to eat - and bring it to you ( how much champagne can one drink at breakfast??). We stayed on the island in an Ocean villa and it was stunning - we didn't want to leave it and spent most days sunbathing in the privacy of our garden. Free bikes are provided which is a lovely touch and a great way of working off those breakfasts!! Special mention for all the staff at Bamboo who catered to our every whim - exceptional service from everyone especiallyJanital,Prakash,Samel the Camel and the pregnant chef! Also thank you to Didier for making it extra special -top marks for a perfect resort ! Mr and Mrs Pearson",Date of stay: August 2014,Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita,4,Mauritius
