Great food & service/ tip of 12.5% included in the bill,"The food and the drinks here are very good! I am impressed with their quality and the service is good as well. Prices are good as well (beef stake for £12.00 is more than acceptable)
The only reason why I am giving them 3 stars is because of the 12.5% tip included in the bill.
It should be my decision to leave you something and how much if I am happy with the meal. For this reason only I may not go back.",Date of visit: October 2019,Le Restaurant de Paul,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Best food on the island,"We were 6 people and ate in this place three times. This was by far the best food on the island! Very good prices, huge sides and very tasty food.",Date of visit: August 2019,Gonia,1,"Poros, Greece"
Amazing day,"Me and my family spent a great I have visited Acropolis with 3 other people yesterday. While we were impressed with the long lansting ruins and their majestic posture, we were highly disappointed in the organisation and personnel's attitude.
My boyfriend had a mug from his workplace with him, in an attempt to make a joke with his co-workers, he put the mug on a rock (no signs indicating that you we were not allowed to take a picture with the mobile phone or that we should not touch the object) and took a picture of it. We were whistled and shout at and one of the ""guards"" came to us afterwards demeaning that he erases the photo. Later on, the same person told us that we were not supposed to bring water from outside.
We were reported via walkie talkie and followed around the site by other ""guards"".
Other information which may come in handy: the water on site is €4.5 a 500ml bottle and the ticket for the Acropolis and Dyonisios experience we had on the island.",Date of experience: August 2019,Poseidon Fishing Trips,1,"Poros, Greece"
Nice place,Nice place souransed by nature. You can go about 10m into water without the need to swim. There are small fish in the water that were biting us but nothing harmful. The food and drinks on the beach were great (very friendly staff as well) and good prices. Two sunbeds and an umbrella cost €8.00 as a reference. About 4-5km from the city.,Date of experience: August 2019,Love Bay (Limanaki Agapis),1,"Poros, Greece"
"Good food, friendly staff","I went to eat three times at Poseidon during our stay in Poros. They have the best tzatziki I have ever had, great fish, souvlaki and wine, the staff is super friendly. A lemon drink is given on the house at the end. Good prices. The only incident we had was in the last night when a side of fries side was almost cold but the owner came at the table, understood the situation and took it off the check (5 stars for the attitude!).",Date of visit: August 2019,Poseidon taverna,1,"Poros, Greece"

Great experience where elephants are happy,"We went at the sanctuary on 19/11/2017. This was the most beautiful experience we had in Thailand. We feed the elephants, went into the mud pit with them and then into the water to play. I wished though that the shower and the lunch part was not included in the 3.5 hours program (it takes more than an hour of the time that could be spent with the elephants). It appeared that the elephants are taken good care of and I am happy to have contributed to some food or good treatment for them. The price for this experience was 2600 baht (around $80.00 or £60.00 per person). For Thais the minimum wage a day is 300 baht and I would assume that this park relies entirely on turism. However, this type of sanctuary raises awareness among the locals and hopefully more and more elephants can be saved from exploitation and violence. At the park employees seem to love the elephants and were very helpful (the majority of them speak English). I would definitely recommend this park if you go to Phuket.",Date of experience: November 2017,Elephant Retirement Park Phuket,1,"Phuket, Thailand"
Lots of rules/ slow staff,"We were requested to pay 1000 baht deposit or leave a passport when checking in. The hotel looks decent. Cleanliness wise is not a five star - we had to call someone to clean the ""head"" of the bed as it was covered in something that appeared to be mud - but it is ok. There is no safe box in the room. There are quite a few rules for the guests - images attached. One of them is ""not to make loud noise"". This bothered me a as I was there with friends and it was holiday and I do not want to whisper so that I am not told to leave the hotel. Also I did not like the ""Thank you"" ( in quotation marks!) from the bottom of another set of rules available on the door.
We booked two nights on two separate occasions and we were requested to do an additional check out and check in though we stayed in the same room.
Stuff were taking their shoes of at the reception and in the rooms. While I do agree that Thai people have a different culture that require guests to take shoes off when visiting someone, this is a hotel (I remained bare foot initially but then I gave up)
Breakfast takes place at a close caffe bar/ restaurant and I would recommend this place (excellent service and good quality food). Better to pay at the reception for breakfast (200 baht/ person) than pay in store ( this will not restrict your options but you will end up paying much more).
The airport helped us book a van for the airport ride. Me and my boyfriend ended up sustaining the luggage of all people in the car as there was no dedicated space for bags (in case on an emergency we would have had no room for escape as we were blocked). On top of this the driver missed two passengers and he had to drive back about 7-8 minutes to pick them up.",Date of stay: November 2017,iRest Ao Nang Seafront,1,"Ao Nang, Thailand"
Lovely place,"The hotel was clean and staff was lovely. Good value for the money, quiet with very nice people. The owner was a Dutch man with his Thai wife (I did not meet her but I assume she was as lovely and helpful as he was). Apart from this, the reception staff was great and smiley at al times Good food at breakfast and came just in time. The hotel helped us get a boat tour as well - Seahi Tours if I am not wrong (good price compared to the market and lovely crew ) - for James Bond island and some other touristy attractions.

I would definitely recommend this hotel in Patong.",Date of stay: November 2017,Memory Patong,1,"Phuket, Thailand"
Not impressive,"There are many things to visit in the surrounding of the castle. The only one that seemed interesting to me was the St. Vitus Cathedral and the Powder Tower. The Old Royal Palace was mostly empty and apart from the nice ceiling there was pretty much nothing to see. Also, it is prohibited to take pictures withing the Palace or the Story of Prague castle building. There are three circuits available and depending on what one requires there are different buildings available to visit. A and C are 300 CZK and to me A seemed to be the most interesting at that time. If I would go back in time, I would not visit the castle again, there are many better things to do and to see in Prague.",Date of experience: August 2016,Prague Castle,1,"Prague, Czech Republic"
Great experience,"The National Technical Museum is a great place to visit in Prague. It is not expensive, it's clean, the objects are well preserved and very diverse. I was really impressed with this place, even if I don't usually like museums.",Date of experience: August 2016,National Technical Museum,1,"Prague, Czech Republic"
"Amazing food, great customer service and good prices","This is the place to go if you want good customer service and amazing quality at a very good price. I was in Prague for 5 days and during this time I eat 3 times here. Everybody was nice, the food was delicious and the restaurant was always clean and tidy. With two occasions I had pizza and the third time I ordered a salad (lettuce, rocket, pear, cheese, etc), they were all really good. I would say that this restaurant will be my first choice if I ever visit Prague again. It is not very close to the City center but I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed in this place, so it is worth the long walk - Andel tube station. The service was good, everybody speaks English, the waiters are nice, the place is cozy, wireless available. All in all extraordinary experience.",Date of visit: August 2016,Corleone Restorante Pizzeria Andel,1,"Prague, Czech Republic"
"Great food, affordable prices","I was here with three fiends - I ordered pasta, they ordered pizza -the food came really fast, the service was good, the food was delicious and the prices were affordable. I will strongly recommend this place for a meal.",Date of visit: August 2016,Giovanni Pizzeria Ristorante,1,"Prague, Czech Republic"
"Amazing food, good prices, great customer service","This place was an inspired choice to take the lunch. It is not in the middle of the city center but it's totally worth to go over there, The customer service is amazing and so is the food. I ordered a hamburger and I was really pleased with eat - I can still feel the flavor of it whenever I am thinking of it. I strongly recommend this place for a meal. Even if it looks really posh, the prices are not that high - it's not a cheap restaurant but I think that the price is a fair one. One cannot walk away disappointed from here.",Date of visit: August 2016,BeefHouse Grill&Bar,1,"Prague, Czech Republic"
