Prague June 2019,"I spend a lot of time in Courtyards for work. This was one of my favorite because their staff was super helpful showing my family how to get around. Across the street is a mall, grocery store (open late), and subway Green line (Flora) stop. Prime location allows you access and see Prague via subway. Hotel sells 24 hour train tickets and 30 minute tickets. When trying to find its location it is near the radio tower with the babies on it. Would stay here again.",Date of stay: June 2019,Courtyard by Marriott Prague City,4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
Near Venice June 2019,"We are a family of 4. Sometimes you are surprised by a hotel. We traveled from Vienna by train Venice to go on cruise. Got on another train, believe 3 stops away, caught a cab and we couldn’t have been happier with this hotel. Staff was fantastic, rooms were great. Wished we had time to see this city.",Date of stay: June 2019,AC Hotel Padova By Marriott,4,"Padua, Italy"
Below average,"Look the best thing about this hotel is it is by the airport and their is a grocery store 200 yards away. Family of 4, had a handicap room. Two TVs 1 remote. Sink linked. No phone in room to call down to front desk. Worst, smallest trash can in the world and only had 1. Shower filled the whole bathroom with water. AC never changed off the program and it was Hot. We were only here to catch an early morning flight to London but this was not worth the money. I’m a Marriott Gold member and would highly recommend any other hotel near the airport.",Date of stay: June 2019,Moxy Vienna Airport,4,"Schwechat, Austria"
Norwegian Star to Fishing Boat,"Unfortunately our time here was limited because of the cruise itinerary. Regardless this was a great adventure. We are a family of 4, Antonia was a great host. She was waiting for us as our ship docked and did a great job communicating back and forth with us. This trip is a hidden gem. When we arrived, we were treated with Greek coffee, cake, and sweet bread. 45 minutes later we were jumping off the boat, taking videos, and then swimming to XI beach. Next we enjoyed a delicious FEAST. Homemade white wine, bruschetta, lobster, spaghetti, Greek salad, and the best potato salad ever. Antonia my wife wants that potato salad recipe. Look if you want to get off the beaten path, I would highly recommend this. Great husband and wife host and their friend is a great chief. We really enjoyed this and my college kids loved this too.",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
