Great experience!,"We spent one full day with Andreas and Marios discovering the islands around Pollonia and loved it! The fishing experience at the beginning of the trip, the incredible food, the amazing spots for swimming and the very attentionate service all made this the highlight of our stay in Milos, for adults as well as for children.",,Explore Milos with PoseidonÂ®,5,"Milos, Greece"
