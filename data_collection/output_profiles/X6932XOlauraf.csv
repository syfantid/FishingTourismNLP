Lovely meal,Visited for an evening meal. Had the most authentic meal of our holiday here. Good service at a standard price.,Date of visit: September 2018,Persas Taverna,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Amazing meal!,"Chose the ""special"" main course advertised on the board. Had the most delicious Sea Bream, simply grilled and served with salad and chips. Tastiest bread we ate all week but more importantly, the best Baklava served all week. Great service and food at a fair price.",Date of visit: September 2018,Captain Jerry's,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best day of our holiday!,"A fabulous day on Efi and Dimitrios' working fishing boat. You couldn't meet a more welcoming and friendly couple. I emailed Efi from the UK and booked our places in advance. We were greeted onto a spotlessly clean boat with a coffee and biscuits. We then helped bring the fishing nets in and taking the day's catch out of the nets, Efi helped us to identify each species. We had 3 swim spots during the day, one being to a small pebbled cove with crystal clear warm water, perfect for snorkelling and totally idyllic. Being summoned back to the boat, we were greeted with the catch of the day for lunch, having been grilled and accompanied with the most delicious greek and potato salad, and local wine/beer, all prepared by Efi. The day went far too quickly and it is a trip we will definitely repeat next year when we return to Kefalonia. I can't recommend this trip highly enough.",Date of experience: September 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Birthday celebration,"Stayed 2 weeks ago for a surprise 50th birthday celebration. 4 poster room with fantastic sea views and a gorgeous bathroom, THE most amazing dinner and the tastiest English Breakfast I've eaten in a long time. Had 2 beach walks from the front door. Location was a peaceful retreat and we came away relaxed and our batteries recharged. Will definitely return and bring our bikes as 1 night not enough. Hotel owners were the perfect hosts, friendly and accommodating. Thank you for helping to make this a very special birthday.",Date of stay: March 2016,Romney Bay House Hotel,4,"Littlestone-on-Sea, United Kingdom"
