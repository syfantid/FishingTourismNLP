BEST GELATO IN SAMOS!!,"A perfect end to a perfect day in Pythagorion! After a beautiful day at sea fishing with Samos Fishing Trips was a visit to Storia Dolce! After a recommendation from a friend we visited Storia Dolce and it is a beautiful little place! Clean, bright and very friendly staff! Took us awhile to decide (SO many amazing choices!) But my wife had the Pralines and cream, myself the Oreo and my son had in my mind the best out of all! The Vaflaki special! Fresh made to order mini waffles and your choice of toppings! so good! Highly recommended! Stop, relax, people watch and enjoy!",Date of visit: August 2019,Storia Dolce,4,"Samos, Greece"
GREEK HOSPITALITY AT ITS FINEST!,"This is a MUST do when visiting Samos! Giannis and Nancy along with their daughter Areti provide an experience found nowhere else in Samos! Their expertise in my mind is not the fishing but the hosting and cooking. The fishing was phenomenal but had we caught no fish at all would not have mattered. This beautiful family is what made our day. They are genuinely good people and Nancy is a PHENOMENAL cook! The greek feast she prepared for us at sea was amazing! The seafood pasta was to die for! The day was split up between fishing,swimming, drinking greek beer and feasting on greek food and wine....lots of it! We stopped at a beautiful beach that is frequented by locals and only reachable by boat or 850m hike down a mountainside. One word breathtaking. My family is from Samos and this felt like a family get together rather than an excursion. I can't thank them enough for making our family feel like part of theirs!

"Great food, cold beer and good times!","Needed a place to escape the Belize heat so stepped into the Wet Lizard for a cold Belikin beer and a bite to eat. We shared some meat pies and I had the curry chicken, both were excellent! The Wet Lizard is a must try while in Belize!",Date of visit: April 2018,Wet Lizard,4,"Belize City, Belize"
One word....WOW,"Whether it is out for lunch with colleagues, out for a quick beer with some buddies or a date night The Brig NEVER disappoints! The Brig will cater to every palate with a great selection of local craft beer, quality spirits and a menu as diverse as its surroundings. Ample portions of delictable gourmet eats you would likely find in a stuffy french bistro but twice the portions, half the price and with great service and the cozy feel of a pub. The Brig is a must try if you are a first time visitor to Ottawa or a local looking for your new favourite spot. Bon appetit and cheers!",Date of visit: June 2017,The Brig Pub,4,"Ottawa, Canada"
