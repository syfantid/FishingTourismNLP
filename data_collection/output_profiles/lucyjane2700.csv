Best trip ever!!,"This fishing trip was definitely one of the best excursions I have ever been on and gave me a real insight into the hard work of a fisherman.
As soon as you arrive are you greeted kindly by the crew and made to feel extremely welcome. You are provided with freshly made cake and drinks as you make your way to the nets. Once at the nets you are free to walk around the boat and watch the nets come out from the water and get a first look at the daily catch.
All food provided on the day is super fresh and organic and definitely some of the most delicious food I have ever tasted.
I would 1000% recommend this trip to anybody, one of the best experiences of my life!!!",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
