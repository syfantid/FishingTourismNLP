Second visit,"Fantastic day spent with Efi Bacha Takidou and Dimitrios on 13th August. When we booked our return to Kefalonia this year we knew this day trip was a must again. Loved the whole day, from the swimming in the beautiful clear Ionian, the clay spa, seeing the many varieties of fish and then lunch. Efi you are an amazing cook and the homemade wine was excellent. Have never had the opportunity to try Barracuda before. Such a wonderful day with such lovely people.",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
