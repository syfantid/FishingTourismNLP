Fishing fantastico!,"Best day of the two weeks holiday. Traditional fishing with a local family. Made to feel part of the whole experience. A MUST for any keen fishermen. Pulled up on a lovely beach, ate what we caught and swam from the boat. Maximum of 12 people so totally authentic. Lovely people on board and the hosts were amazing. Almost forgot to mention the wine and dancing. Thanks to you from Rob and Lisa xxx",Date of experience: October 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
