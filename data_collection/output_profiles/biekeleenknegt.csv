Amazing learnfull experience !!!,"We went with our family and had a great time !!!
We got to see how to fish and were able to try it ourselves which was a once of a life experience also we stopped at a few beaches where we could swim and later that day we ate the fish we caught ! I really recommend this to families and friend and I can promise you that you'll have a great time.
Dimitrios and Efthimia are a lovely couple to hang around with and they'll give you a excellent time :)",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
