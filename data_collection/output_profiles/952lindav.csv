A must visit,"In our opinion, this must be the best place in Sidmouth for breakfast. Very tasty food, beautifully presented. Lots of choice for those that have gluten and dairy intolerance like me. They also have a good selection of cakes but we didn’t get to try them - too full up!",Date of visit: August 2020,Milsons Point Café,1,"Sidmouth, United Kingdom"
We ate here three times in one week,"We ate here three times during our week’s holiday. The food is lovely and we had most things on the menu. Yes, it’s served in cartons with wooden cutlery, but we found this made it more fun. The serving staff are friendly and really helpful. We would recommend it highly to anyone visiting Sidmouth.",Date of visit: August 2020,The Pea Green Boat Restaurant,1,"Sidmouth, United Kingdom"
Came here as had read that,"Came here as had read that they offered a good gluten free selection. Although GF scones were not on the winter menu, a couple of delicious warm ones magically appeared along with some lovely jam. The chap serving even went down the road to buy some clotted cream to go with them. My husband had the cheese platter which he thoroughly enjoyed. The coffee was delicious too. So friendly and helpful here. Wonderful!",Date of visit: February 2020,The Cornish Deli,1,"St Ives, United Kingdom"
Excellent,"My husband and I visited for the Heroes of Voyager wine tasting and four course meal. The young man who introduced us to the wines, we believe his name is Adam, was helpful and informative. The restaurant staff were again friendly and informative. The chef, Sandi, did and amazing job adapting the menu to suit my wheat and dairy intolerance. The food, wine and service was amazing. The venue is so pretty and much nicer than the very large, more commercial, wineries we have visited.",Date of visit: October 2019,Voyager Estate,1,"Margaret River, Australia"
Excellent,"We’d had a busy few weeks prior to arriving in Perth so a gentle cruise along the Swan River was perfect. Tea/coffee and muffins on arrival. My husband said the chocolate one was delicious. Four samples of wine with a cheese board. Informative commentary as we sailed along the river. Even saw dolphins. Tour of the Sandalford Winery with knowledgeable guide. Wine flight tasting before an excellent two course lunch with a glass of your favourite wine. Cakes and coffee on return to boat.
All staff very friendly and accommodating. Great background music all day complemented by Lauren singing beautifully on the return journey. All this and it was 32 degrees. Perfect day for my husband’s 60th birthday.",Date of experience: October 2019,Captain Cook Cruises,1,"Perth, Australia"
Lovely little restaurant,"Read the reviews of this place and, as it was very near to the hotel, thought we’d give it a try. Don’t be put off by the access up a metal staircase. A little shabby inside but the welcome is great. Two large tables to seat all guests so you get to know the other diners which is great. Choose what drink you want and the size, and that determines the price. Simple. All diners eat the same food which is freshly cooked and delicious. As a couple we had a large salad, 12 gyoza, chicken stir fry, vegetables cooked with pork, and my husband had the pancake with ice cream and maple syrup. We didn’t need seconds although they were offered. We did have the largest G&T in the world!",Date of visit: October 2019,Spiral Staircase,1,"Narita, Japan"
Expensive but convenient,"Had a double room on the 25th floor looking out toward Umeda Building, so great view. Stayed for three nights with two large suitcases as we were staying away from home for some time but there was nowhere to put them out of the way. Very little wardrobe space - about 60cms wide at the most. Room clean and comfortable. Bathroom well equipped. Staff helpful. Lots of choice at breakfast for ‘normal’ eaters but struggled as a person with wheat and dairy intolerance.
No GF bread - and none at any of the other three hotels we have stayed at. No milk alternatives. The staff did prepare me a GF and dairy free breakfast but I was given the same thing three days running - see pic. I don’t like eggs so that added to the problem. On the positive side, very convenient for the station as actually above it. Hundreds of shops and eating places around.",Date of stay: September 2019,Hotel Granvia Osaka,1,"Osaka, Japan"
Fantastic,"Visiting Japan for the first time during the Rugby World Cup, we went to the studios primarily to see the Harry Potter section. I was absolutely thrilled and felt as excited as a six year despite being 60! Screamed on the little roller coaster ride but went on the Forbidden Journey ride twice as we thought it was absolutely brilliant. The whole recreation of the Harry Potter world was phenomenal. Bit out of touch with some of the more modern movies represented at the park. Did not like the big rides so didn’t go on them. We didn’t enjoy the Area 51 experience at all and felt it to be a little daft. Overall though, well worth the money.",Date of experience: September 2019,Universal Studios Japan 1 Day Pass,1,"Osaka, Japan"
Great food,"We stayed at the hotel twice as part of our golden triangle trip. The restaurant staff are really helpful. As a person who cannot tolerate wheat and dairy, I had found the whole trip quite difficult with regards to food choices. However, this restaurant provided a good choice at breakfast and, in the evening, the chefs created dishes that I could eat and enjoy. Thank you in particular to Ajay who cooked the lamb chop dish for me. It was delicious.",Date of visit: September 2019,Ssence,1,"New Delhi, India"
"Good, plentiful food",Visited for the first time with a group of friends. They had the set menu which they really enjoyed and the portions were huge. I chose separate items as I have a wheat and dairy intolerance. The waiter was extremely helpful when I was making my choices. Everything was delicious. Will definitely visit again.,Date of visit: September 2019,Istanbul Grill,1,"Bromley, United Kingdom"
Disappointing,"We had been to this restaurant many times in the past but won’t be visiting again. The starters were good but the main courses were poor. A bland looking almost tasteless plate of food. The roasts looked uninviting, swimming in gravy, and the veg were all green, over cooked and over buttered. The duck dish was tasteless. It’s such a shame as this is a lovely building surrounded by open countryside and it used to be a real treat to visit. Unfortunately, each one of the pubs we have visited in this chain have disappointed. On the plus side, the staff are lovely and it was sad to have to complain. They did give us some money off but we shouldn’t be in this position. Come on Chaser, you can do much better.",Date of visit: September 2019,The Chaser Inn,1,"Tonbridge, United Kingdom"
Good but...,"My husband and I were gifted the Champagne Afternoon Tea which we really looked forward to. The venue and service could not be faulted. The waiting staff were very attentive. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his tea; lovely sandwiches and selection of cakes and scones. However, I am wheat intolerant and the gluten free offering was disappointing. The sandwiches were ok if a little dry. The little cakes were not good at all. I only took a bite of each. The scones were very stodgy once they cooled. When the waiter came round with the slices of cake (carrot and lemon drizzle) he informed me that there was no gluten free cake. ☹️ I had informed the restaurant of my intolerance when I booked and i am sure I wasn’t the only one in the restaurant with this dietary problem. I expected a lot more from such a prestigious venue. Such a shame.",Date of visit: April 2019,The Drawing Room at Brown's Hotel,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Lovely food but ...,"I’ll start by saying that the food was delicious. However, be aware that they put plates of appetisers on your table without telling you that you will be charged. They put two small plates of ham, two of bread and two of cheese on our table of six but failed to mention that 32 Euros would be added to our bill. We were outraged and refused to pay this charge. These items do not even appear on their menu. Such a shame as the food was genuinely good hence I have only awarded three stars.",Date of visit: March 2019,O Surf & Turf,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
What a lovely hotel,"Stayed here with family celebrating my 60th birthday. The reception staff are wonderful; very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. The rooms are beautifully appointed, comfortable and very clean. Nespresso coffee and a free mini bar in the rooms. The restaurant staff made me a lovely gluten free cake for my birthday. Hot breakfast cooked to order. 15 minute walk to centre. Lovely roof top bar.",Date of stay: March 2019,The Vintage Hotel & Spa Lisbon,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Superb,Ten of us went for a birthday celebration and the food and service were excellent. The staff were very helpful and accommodated my wheat and dairy free diet without fuss. It’s the first time I have been to a restaurant where it was no problem. And I was able to have a dessert! Every course was delicious. Can’t recommend it enough.,Date of visit: March 2019,Chapter One,1,"Orpington, United Kingdom"
Superb!,"What a wonderful experience. We eat out a lot and we were very impressed with the restaurant. They accommodated us at the bar as we were a group of five and the place is tiny. They had prepared the menu for me, as I am wheat and dairy intolerant, by ticking those that would be suitable or they could adapt. The staff could not have been more helpful. We had all items on the menu and found them to be delicious and came away feeling very satisfied. Can’t recommend it enough. My favourites? The venison and the Jerusalem artichokes.",Date of visit: December 2018,64 Degrees,1,"Brighton, United Kingdom"
Superb,My husband and I really loved the day. We had only kayaked once before but the fantastic instructors/guides made it so much easier. We did the Argostoli Lighthouse trip. Certainly one of the highlights of our holiday. Would thoroughly recommend it.,Date of experience: August 2018,Sea Kayaking Kefalonia - Greece,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic,"Cannot praise Antonia, Michalis and Hassan enough. Fantastic trip. Really enjoyed the day. So informative. The meal provided from our catch was absolutely delicious. Great company added enjoyment to the trip. Would highly recommend this fun day out.",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Service slow,"Visited with three friends. Was quite busy with lots of families when we visited. Food to usual standard. Glad to see vegan and GF options available. Service was slow after the initial drink and menu choice. When we asked at 10.15pm for some coffees, the waitress (not the one who served us previously), it seemed to be bit too much trouble. She took the order then asked if she could bring the bill so that they could ‘get on with our job’. I may be mistaken but I thought serving customers WAS the job. Fortunately, we laughed but maybe customer service should be their priority.",Date of visit: July 2018,Pizza Express,1,"Bromley, United Kingdom"
Always superb,"We love visiting Lyme Regis but haven’t been able to for a few years. So glad that last weekend we were able to return and stay here once again. Lavinia is always lovely and accommodating. It’s a beautiful guesthouse, superbly run. The breakfast is delicious with good and varied choices. We will return.",Date of stay: July 2018,Westwood Guest House,1,"Lyme Regis, United Kingdom"
Quality food and always friendly,"We use Maxims a lot as it has a good mix of food styles. So many flavours too.
They always do their best to help and advise us or suggest options.
Happy to recommend.",Date of visit: May 2018,Maxims,1,"Orpington, United Kingdom"
Delicious!,"My husband and I visited for lunch yesterday. We were drawn in by the lovely daily menu on display and the open kitchen. We shared the Crispy Pig’s Head appetiser, followed by starters of sole fillet with samphire and the medley of oysters. For mains, the brill and halibut. Desserts of a trio of ice creams and the ginger cake. All courses were beautifully cooked and presented with delicious accompaniments. The waiter and chefs were really helpful with my dairy intolerance and adapted my choices to suit me. They cater for all needs with good vegetarian and vegan menus also. My husband was also thrilled to see that they stock Chapel Down beers and ciders. Portion sizes were very generous even for the children’s meals. There were quite a few families in which was lovely to see especially as some children were trying something new and unusual. We came away very full and very satisfied. The food, staff and venue were all wonderful. We’ll definitely visit again.",Date of visit: February 2018,Wyatt & Jones,1,"Broadstairs, United Kingdom"
Insufficient answer,"I complained about the fact that, having had a Hair in our food, which you say is from a butter brush, you didn't answer the fact that you add a gratuity to the bill whatever our experience! In our case, we feel the waiting service was ok, but the management just ignored our complaint. So why should the waiting staff be punished for something that has nothing to do with them. I always add a gratuity, as both my daughter and I both work in the service industry. We always hope the waiting staff get the gratuity too? I just don't like the Management forcing it on us! If you get bad service from the waiting staff, how do you let them know? It can be embarrassing to be questioned at the end of a meal. In truth, none of this would be an issue if the experience at your Restaurant was as good as it should be! I should only be writing rave reviews on Trip Advisor",Date of visit: February 2018,Indian Essence by Atul Kochhar,1,"Orpington, United Kingdom"
Beautiful wedding venue,"Our daughter married at Tredudwell Manor on New Year’s Eve and it was magical. The Manor House has been beautifully restored and has lovely, well appointed, very comfortable rooms. The staff were lovely, really helpful and professional. The pavilion, where the ceremony and celebrations were held, was ideal and has panoramic views over the valley. The venue provided the bar staff who worked tirelessly throughout the whole event and were lovely. Valerie and Justin have created a wonderful venue and I can’t recommend it enough.",Date of stay: December 2017,Tredudwell Manor,1,"Fowey, United Kingdom"
Lovely restaurant,"Hidden away in a side street near the cathedral, this restaurant is a real gem. The waiting staff are helpful and friendly. We shared an octopus starter, followed by the lamb with a pistachio coating and the guinea fowl. Both delicious. For dessert we had the gluten free hot chocolate dessert and the cheese. The only thing my husband felt was missing, was some fruit or chutney with the cheese but that’s personal taste. Thoroughly recommended.",Date of visit: October 2017,CITRUS,1,"Nice, France"
Not good!,"Clubhouse seems stark and bare. Barkeep great and enthusiastic.
Course poor but acceptable for time of year. (certainly not ""The Best Greens in Kent"") The round started slowly and then got slower and slower. Two four balls on buggies took forever, and were never challenged. Strangely a two ball were squeezed in at the tenth hole!!! That made it worse! We called the clubhouse. That didn't help. It's NOT GOOD!",Date of experience: November 2017,Darenth Valley Golf Course,1,"Sevenoaks, United Kingdom"
Greedy Owner,"We were 24 Golfers celebrating a 50th Birthday and were seated in an area that could have been segregated from other diners. Yet the owner seated two other families in the same area.
There was confusion as to who had ordered what and a few had the wrong meals, we didn't complain. Nor did we complain when a waiter dropped condiments and mustard over one of our golfers.
Part of our celebrations included a rather noisy singing of 'Happy Birthday to You'
This apparently upset other diners, and the owner decided to complain to us that we were causing a nuisance to other patrons of his restaurant.
We felt that, not only had he accepted our long standing booking, he had also squeezed an extra couple of tables in the area we were in.
The ages of our party span from 35 to 80 years old, so although we can be boisterous, we are very respectful of others. In fact we bought drinks for the families adjacent to us as there was quite a lot of noise in a relatively small space.
We felt the owner had, instead of separating us from the other diners as a large group, decided to make use of an area, to make money out of extra customers.
The evening was spoilt for us and possibly for others in the restaurant. Very unnecessary!
So although the food and the service from the waiting staff was good, the Owner was rude.",Date of visit: July 2017,Dolphin Inn Restaurant,1,"Thorpeness, United Kingdom"
Super!,"We were recommended this place by a Spanish speaking Brit who had lived in the area for some years. Took a while to find it but well worth the effort. Loved the fact that it was mainly Spanish families around us. Used what little Spanish we have and it seemed to be appreciated. Staff very accommodating considering they were very busy and we hadn't booked. Super food, reasonably priced. Best Cafe Bonbon I'd had. Will definitely revisit when we go back in August.",Date of visit: May 2017,Chiringito Torre Velerin,1,"Estepona, Spain"
Substantial meals!,"This restaurant enjoys a great reputation which is well deserved. The big eaters in our group were delighted by the huge portions. Each course was enough for two. If I were to criticise I'd say don't put Chipsticks on the plate with the homemade croquetas or use tinned potatoes with the veg. Lovely Sole, expertly de-boned at the table; lovely (seven) lamb cutlets; John Dory; huge lamb shoulder, all with mixed veg, rice, Dauphinoise potatoes - and chips. Far too much bread was offered for my (gluten intolerant) taste: French toast with pate; garlic bread and large freshly baked crispy rolls, were all included in the table charge. If you don't have a big appetite, share. You have been warned lol!",Date of visit: May 2017,Los Abanicos,1,"Benahavis, Spain"
Always superb,"I just love coming here when I visit. Always wonderful, innovative, tasty food. Delicious homemade pies and fresh fish. So many great choices, it's hard to choose. On this occasion I had whole fresh plaice with pesto which was delicious followed by a wonderful mulled wine apple and pear crumble with peach sorbet. Very reasonably priced too. Can't wait to visit again.",Date of visit: December 2016,Jolly Jacks,1,"Plymouth, United Kingdom"
Brilliant!,"We attended an early show with the paella meal as part of our daughter's 30th birthday celebration. The food was great. The musicians, singers and dancers were superb. We were blown away by the fabulous show. Well worth the visit. Highly recommended.",Date of experience: October 2016,La Bodega Flamenca (Flamenco Barcelona),1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Lovely hotel in great location,"Stayed for four nights (should have been six but flight delay and ferry crossing cancellations shortened it). Would love to have stayed longer. In a super position at the bottom end of St George's Beach. Nice quiet spot. Super triple room, beautifully decorated. Great pool area. Two minute walk to beach. Ten/fifteen minutes to the town. Enjoyed a tasty Greek meal on our first evening - great food for a very reasonable 15 Euros. Can't thank Katerina enough for all the help she gave us before and after our arrival. All staff friendly and helpful.",Date of stay: August 2016,Alkyoni Beach Hotel,1,"Naxos, Greece"
Ideal beach cade,"Super cafe right on the beach. Contemporary, tasty, modern cuisine. Enjoyed fantastic fish, and surf and turf nights. Reasonably priced. Clean toilets. Loved the decoration! Bean bags on the sand. Great cocktails. What more could you want?",Date of visit: August 2016,Flisvos Beach Cafe,1,"Naxos, Greece"
A little disappointing,"We really like The Chaser at Shipbourne so really welcomed the new addition to the chain in Green Street Green. Our first visit when it was newly opened was a disappointment as the service was really poor although the food was okay. Second visit with friends was again a little disappointing. The service had improved but the food was just average. I think generally this chain overprices it's food. Also there appears to be very little choice for those on a gluten or dairy free diet. As a dessert lover, I always look at the dessert menu first and often end up with one choice which is the sorbet. It seems a shame when so many people have food intolerances or allergies that there is so little choice.",Date of visit: May 2016,The Rose and Crown,1,"Orpington, United Kingdom"
At last South East Asian food in Orpington!,"So pleased to have a new restaurant in Orpington serving this type of food. Only recently opened. The Salt and Chilli Pepper Prawns and Malaysian Chicken Curry I had were excellent and very well priced. My fellow diners thoroughly enjoyed their meals too. Lovely, helpful waiting staff. We will return soon.",Date of visit: April 2016,Joy Kitchen,1,"Orpington, United Kingdom"
Average,Haven't been here for some considerable time but thought I'd revisit with some friends. Waiting staff constantly hovered to take our orders so we felt rushed into each decision. Food arrived very quickly which always worries me as I wonder whether it's been zapped in a microwave. Food was not exceptional and quite expensive. I remembered then why I hadn't been for a while and won't be rushing back.,Date of visit: April 2016,Xian,1,"Orpington, United Kingdom"
Fabulous,"My sister and I came one Saturday lunchtime as a birthday treat. The service and welcome from the minute we arrived was superb. We had the set three course lunch and every course was excellent. We weren't expecting an appetiser, bread or petit fours but they were a delicious addition to the meal. Very good value for money. Will definitely return.",Date of visit: March 2016,The Restaurant at The Capital,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Authentic Thai food,"Great Thai restaurant. Authentic tasting, good value food. Lovely, comfortable surroundings. Highly recommended.",Date of visit: February 2016,Supha's Street Food Emporium,1,"Plymouth, United Kingdom"
Always excellent,Always visit this restaurant when in Plymouth. Wish there was something as good nearer to our home. Fantastic food every time.
