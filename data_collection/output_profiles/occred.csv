Wonderful 2 days in St. Petersburg with Alex's Tours,Our driver and tour guide were excellent. The tour hit all of the high points in St. Petersburg and more. Having a private guide in the Hermitage was a time saver. One of our favorite things to do in a foreign country is to interact with the people of that country. We asked our guide to joins us for lunch and also to select places that she normally went to. It was very relaxing and gave us an opportunity to just chat with the guide and sample the local food. Although the private tours tend to be more expensive than the ones offered by the cruise ship it is well worth the extra expense to experience the country in a more intimate way. I would highly recommend Alex's Tours if you are in St. Petersburg.,Date of experience: September 2017,Alex's Tours and Travel,1,"St. Petersburg, Russia"
Beautiful coast,Giuseppe picked us up at the cruise port and we headed to Sorrento with several stops on the way to see the beautiful coastline. Giuseppe was very informative. When we arrived in Positano he had arranged for us to eat at da Costanfino. We had a wonderful lunch with a breathtaking view. We stopped at Pompeii on the way back. It was amazing but we were a little confused as they were out of English maps. The private tours are really nice in that you can spend more or less time at sights as you wish. We wanted to enjoy the Amalfi coast and this tour delivered. Highly recommend them.,Date of experience: May 2018,Pompeii - Sorrento - Positano small group,1,"Naples, Italy"
Amazing day! Best part of our trip!,"Efi and Dimitrios are the best hosts you will ever meet. They treat you like family and do everything thing they can to make your fishing experience great. Efi is a great cook.She created a feast which we could not even finish. They obviously love what they do and are happy to share their love of fishing with you. We even caught eel and octopus!
This will be the most remembered day of our trip! It is the first thing we mention when asked about our trip. After seeing many ruins in Greece this was a wonderful opportunity to spend time with the people of Greece. DO THIS! You will not regret it.",Date of experience: May 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Beware. You may be cancelled.,"I made a reservation on May 5, 2016 for June 25, 2016. I received a confirmation number. They charged my credit card. On June 18 I received a call from a reservation company informing me that the Dunes was overbooked & would not honor my confirmed reservation. One would think that the Dunes would be aware of the supposed ""overbooking"" earlier than 7 weeks before the reservation date. Out of curiosity I checked online on June 24. Booking.com was offering rooms at $45 more than I paid. Coincidence? Note: there was not a no star option.",Date of stay: June 2016,Dunes Motel,1,"Bend, Oregon"
Wonderful tour with Liz of Real English Tours,"We were in port on a cruise and had previously booked a 3 hour walking tour with Liz.
A few days before we were in port I realized that due to a knee injury I would not be able to walk for 3 hours. I contacted Richard by email and he was very quickly able to switch us to a car tour. It turned out that we were able to cover even more of Montevideo. Before Liz left us she took us to a restaurant and ordered some local specialities for us to enjoy. Both Richard & Liz are most accommodating and are an excellent source of information of Montevideo.I highly recommend Real English Tours.",Date of experience: January 2016,Real English Tours,1,"Montevideo, Uruguay"
