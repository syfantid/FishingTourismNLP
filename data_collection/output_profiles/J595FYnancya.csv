"Local beach, snacks, drinks, lounge chairs","Nice local inlet where you can lounge on a beach chair and have drinks brought to you! Umbrellas, snack bar and calm waters make it great for the whole family.",Date of experience: June 2019,Love Bay (Limanaki Agapis),4,"Poros, Greece"
Captain Giannis is the best!,"Snorkel in turquoise waters, bring in multiple catches, and chat with Giannis who has been fishing half his life! Not only charismatic and friendly, this young man is tireless and skillful. His innovative luring method ensures everyone will enjoy the sensation of a fish on the line. Line caught on the boat? Giannis will dive underneath and free it. Interested in spearfishing? Watch Giannis dive amazing depths and bring up a grouper. Afterwards he'll prepare your catch on the boat along with tasty sides, wine, beer and homemade lemonade. Don't miss a day on the water in the most comfortable boat around for the most reasonable price available with the most competent, knowledgeable captain we've met. Just fabulous!",Date of experience: June 2019,Poseidon Fishing Trips,4,"Poros, Greece"
