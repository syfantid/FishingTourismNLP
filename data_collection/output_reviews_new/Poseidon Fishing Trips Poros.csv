Nice boat, lots of shade, great scenery  - and then the excitement of watching Giannis spear fish - then every one helped with the whitebait nets and others fished from the boatA lot of fish caught , cooked and eaten for lunch - just perfect  !We swam and snorkelled , but for our teenagers the highlight was the fishing Giannis and George were charming hosts and Giannis took the youngestcin his very high speed boat for the last bit - very exciting Highly recommneded - a great trip"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gyoergy1,October 2019,5,Perfect day on the sea,"We spent a very nice day on the sea. We caught lots of tuna, Giannis knows well the good places. He was also very helpful and made a fantastic lunch for us."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilyhR3760BX,September 2019,5,Excellent day out!,Giannis is an excellent host aboard his fishing boat. We booked a private trip for 4 people which was very reasonably priced. 3 fishing lines to share was plenty to catch enough for lunch. A nice refreshing dip in a quiet untouched cove followed by beautifully barbequed fish that we caught just hours earlier. The table was laid out beautifully with a fresh salad and complimentary dips to accompany the catch of the day. Giannis's days spent in the kitchen at Poseidon restaurant was most welcome at lunch!A much recommended trip for those who are passionate about fishing or simply rather enjoy the 5 star views from the front of the boat with a few glasses of local wine 
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdaHK123,August 2019,5,Amazing Fishing / Lunch trip - perfect for friends or family,"We came to Poros from New York with basically no plans. We went to Poseidon Taverna (lovely restaurant) and asked the owner where we could rent a boat. He said there were no boat rental places on the island but his son (also works at the restaurant) takes groups on fishing trips. You can hire the boat privately for the day, as my fiancé and I did.  We chose to go spear fishing. The captain, Giannis, is an expert spear fisherman and it’s amazing to watch him free dive. And his English is great. He caught several fish as we watched with snorkels from the surface. He then grilled the fish on board and served the most delicious lunch, fresh Greek salad, bread and tzatziki (the best meal we have had in Greece!). The boat was beautiful - an upgraded version of an authentic fishing boat with lounge chairs, a picnic table for meals, large canopy for shade, comfortable turf deck and bathroom on board. It was an amazing experience and if you like being on the water, this is a must-do in Poros.  Check out the Facebook page for pictures. "

We all caught fish under Giannis guidance to much delight of young and old! Secluded bays for swimming and snorkelling... diving off the boat  followed by a lovely lunch of our catch of the day. We highly recommend Giannis hospitality, humour, expertise and culinary skills.... what a top day thank you."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntoineC903,August 2019,5,Awesome experience,I ve been on Giannis boat with my wife and my two young kids (2 and 4). We had an incredible experience. Went fishing and caught 8 fish that Giannis prepared for lunch on the bbq. Visited Poros from the sea and stopped on a small island where we were alone. Giannis is a very experienced skipper and very nice as well.We will do it again next time we come!! 
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D1801CAchrise,August 2019,5,Legendary trip ,We went last year and came back for 2 more trips this year! Giannis is a brilliant skipper as was Christa hosting. Always fun and interesting. The fishing was superb as was the swimming and snorkelling. You must go if you’re staying in Poros or nearby.
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anamariav142,August 2019,5,Amazing day ,"Me and my family spent a great I have visited Acropolis with 3 other people yesterday. While we were impressed with the long lansting ruins and their majestic posture, we were highly disappointed in the organisation and personnel's attitude.My boyfriend had a mug from his workplace with him, in an attempt to make a joke with his co-workers, he put the mug on a rock (no signs indicating that you we were not allowed to take a picture with the mobile phone or that we should not touch the object) and took a picture of it. We were whistled and shout at and one of the ""guards"" came to us afterwards demeaning that he erases the photo. Later on, the same person told us that we were not supposed to bring water from outside.We were reported via walkie talkie and followed around the site by other ""guards"". Other information which may come in handy: the water on site is €4.5 a 500ml bottle and the ticket for the Acropolis and Dyonisios  experience we had on the island."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/392SimonS,July 2019,5,Great day out on the sea,"My partner, mother and two nieces and I had a fabulous day out on the sea with Giannis - the food was amazing, the trip itself was fantastic and Giannis could not have been kinder or more attentive. We’d go again in a heartbeat."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amandacrichardson,July 2019,5,Snorkeling and fishing bliss,Had an unbelievable day out in the crystal clear waters surrounding Poros with our captain Giannis. We watched as he spear fished two Parrot fish for our lunch as we snorkeled at beautiful protected spots along the coast. As 6 friends in their late 20s this was the perfect day exploring the island for us. Giannis is a wonderful cook and has incredible expert local knowledge. Would highly recommend and will be coming back on our next trip!

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J595FYnancya,June 2019,5,Captain Giannis is the best!,"Snorkel in turquoise waters, bring in multiple catches, and chat with Giannis who has been fishing half his life!  Not only charismatic and friendly, this young man is tireless and skillful.  His innovative luring method ensures everyone will enjoy the sensation of a fish on the line.  Line caught on the boat?  Giannis will dive underneath and free it. Interested in spearfishing?  Watch Giannis dive amazing depths and bring up a grouper.  Afterwards he'll prepare your catch on the boat along with tasty sides, wine, beer and homemade lemonade.  Don't miss a day on the water in the most comfortable boat around for the most reasonable price available with the most competent, knowledgeable captain we've met.  Just fabulous!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbj5947,June 2019,5,Fishing!,"Wonderful experience!  We caught more than we could eat and swam in the most amazing waters!   Our skipper was fun, professional and a great cook!  This is a must do in Poros!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/943vinnief,June 2019,5,Poros Greece Fishing & Meal,Fantastic experience. Lines were already baited. We just pulled in the fish and our Captain Giannis then cooked the fish we caught and served lots of other food. And we got to swim in the sea. Very pleasant 1/2 day on the water.
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/838peggyk,June 2019,5,Mrs,The highlight of our trip.  Our captain met our every desire.  Caught enough fish to feed an army.  The lunch was wonderful.  I would recommend this trip to everyone for the most delightful day on the sea you will ever experience.

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lbjolicoeur,June 2019,5,Absolute BEST Way to Spend a Day on the Sea!,"We spent a day on the sea with Captain Giannis Anagnostopoulos on board the  Poseidon Poros! We pulled in some long lines that Giannis had baited and dropped the night before, and “caught” our lunch for the day. Not satisfied with the number of fish, Giannis put on his spearfishing gear and brought in a Golden Grouper. He laid out a beautiful table with cheese, salad, fruit, grilled bread, tzatziki, beer and wine, to accompany our delicious, fresh, grilled fish. Swimming, snorkeling and lounging in the sea made the afternoon perfect! #flyingoliveadventures #poseidontours #sunandsea"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D1801CAchrise,August 2018,5,Brilliant fishing trip and snorkelling,"An amazing day out and what Poros has been missing. Giannis is a brilliant skipper, host, fishing genius! 6 of us went, 3 adults and 3 children and everyone loved it!!! Highly recommend this for all! See you again next year"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/826hilarym,July 2018,5,Fabulous Fishing Trip,"Amazing trip.  Giannis  met us with a beaming smile, his boat looking all lovely and clean, tea and coffee, pastries and beautiful fresh fruit and homemade lemonade was set out for our breakfast.  Off to an exceptional start as far as a non fisherwoman is concerned!The trip can be tailored to your requirements - we wanted to catch a big fish so went deep sea fishing, which proved to work very well as we caught a red snapper.Whilst we went for a swim in the beautiful sea and a walk on a deserted beach, the fresh fish we caught were being prepared by Giannis for our lunch.  Absolutely stunning.  I honestly cannot recommend this enough, a truly fabulous experience and not only for people who enjoy fishing."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paveln637,July 2018,5,Best adventure and superb service!,"We went to Poros with our 9 years old boy, who is crazy about fishing. Honestly, didn’t know what to expect, just saw a shared FB post and decided to try. All of this were because of a kid, but it turned out the best adventure for all of us! Sailing, fishing, snorkeling, learning and delicious launch - all over the top expectations!First we went to fish in a quite distant deep spot, tried several types of fishing, then sailed closer to the shore, fish again, then jumped into the clearest water next to wild beach, snorkled near small reef, then Yannis (capt.) served tasty launch for us with a food from his amazing taverna. Such a unique way to experience the sea, Greek cusine, culture and fishing! Simply, great day for our family! "
