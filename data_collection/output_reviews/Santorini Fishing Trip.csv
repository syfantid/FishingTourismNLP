The boat was lovely and comfortable.  We went to the hot springs and swam while a fresh fish lunch was prepared serving homemade tzaziki sauce, eggplant and other traditional Greek dishes. Afterwards we were serenaded by Kyriakos and Antonis playing violin and guitar singing traditional Greek songs!   We cruised into the caldera and down the coast and passed the red and white beach. Kyriakos and Antonis were the ultimate hosts ensuring our day was the best and succeeded 100%. Book this trip, you will not be disappointed!!â€¦"
