Pure Greek homemade cuisine!,"Before I was thinking that greek food it’s just souvlaki and feta :) but when my GF brought us to Apagio I realized what exactly Ellada’s is all about! Tasty grilled fish, a lot of different types and styles, fresh crunchy salads, great dips, plus wine and such a cosy friendly atmosphere! Our fav were grilled fish, tuna dip, sweet salad Apagio, anchovy marinated with chilli and backed feta cheese in a dough covered in sesame and honey. Most of it were homemade recipes from the owners but perfectly executed.. i was feeling like in greek food heaven..
My GF said Liz and her family runs that business for last 14 years, started with small taverna where they cooked all by themselves, invented unique recipes, and now their son improving it into complete delight.
Highly recommended, this is the way how local island restaurant should be - highest quality, cosy vibe and great staff.",Date of visit: July 2018,Apagio Taverna,5,"Poros, Greece"
Best adventure and superb service!,"We went to Poros with our 9 years old boy, who is crazy about fishing. Honestly, didn’t know what to expect, just saw a shared FB post and decided to try.
All of this were because of a kid, but it turned out the best adventure for all of us! Sailing, fishing, snorkeling, learning and delicious launch - all over the top expectations!
First we went to fish in a quite distant deep spot, tried several types of fishing, then sailed closer to the shore, fish again, then jumped into the clearest water next to wild beach, snorkled near small reef, then Yannis (capt.) served tasty launch for us with a food from his amazing taverna. Such a unique way to experience the sea, Greek cusine, culture and fishing! Simply, great day for our family!",Date of experience: July 2018,Poseidon Fishing Trips,5,"Poros, Greece"
