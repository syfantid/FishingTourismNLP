Pit stop lunch,Stopped here during our walk to Tintagel for a much needed lunch. Really nice staff and a lovely little setting outside. Food was excellent; had the fish finger sandwich with the biggest fish fingers I’ve ever seen and the cream teas are second to none!

Saturday Lunch,"Absolutely amazing lunch here. Had the fig and Gorgonzola salad and shared the shellfish platter with my wife, washed down with a lovely bottle of Vermentino, fantastic! Great service and made to feel very welcome. Although slightly expensive I feel you are getting what u pay for. Would come again!",Date of visit: June 2019,Rick Stein Barnes,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Michalis fishing boat trip!,"What an amazing day! So much more interesting than the usual boat trips, I would highly recommend. We were served with coffee and delicious home made cake whilst we made our way out to the nets. Everyone had such fun watching the nets come in with all sorts of creatures including some massive lobster! A real fascinating insight into the daily life of a real fishing boat.
After bringing in the catch we swam in the sea whilst an amazing meal was cooked for us. Delicious lobster, bruschetta, spaghetti and he best potato salad I’ve ever tasted.
Our hosts were fantastic, friendly, informative and great cooks!
Thank you so much and hope to see you in the future! Good luck with swordfish season!

Great Burgers,Stopped in midweek around 9ish for something to eat. Friendly and efficient service even though my French is apalling. Had the cheeseburger which was of the best I've had so far in Paris.,Date of visit: January 2018,Le Bistrot du Coin,1,"Paris, France"
Fantastic birthday meal with my wife!,"Popped in on a Wednesday eve without booking after craving tapas for a while. Wasn’t disappointed!
Delicious generous portions, great friendly service and all very reasonable. Particular highlight were the homemade churros at the end! We’ll be back!",Date of visit: November 2017,Galicia,1,"Croydon, United Kingdom"
3 Night Stay in August!,"This hotels location is perfect in my opinion, 15 minutes max from the airport, 5 minute walk from 3 different metro stations which all get you to the centre of the city in less than 10 minutes, close to the magic fountains and Plaza Espanya and also it has loads of excellent restaurants and bars nearby (2 of our 3 nights we stayed nearby and had amazing food).
The hotel is very clean and the staff are very helpful and polite. The free bottles of water were also a nice touch.
My only gripe would be the odd positioning of the toilet in the bathroom which meant it was near impossible to get in and out of the shower/bath, still, we managed.
Would stay again.",Date of stay: August 2016,Hotel Vilamari,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Amazing Tapas and loads of Beers!,"We were staying round the corner and read good reviews so paid a visit. The food is incredible, everything was delicious and the service was brilliant. All very good value as well in my opinion.",Date of visit: August 2016,MonDoré,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
After dinner cocktails,"Visited the Tandem cocktail bar after dinner in the area and reading good reviews. Its a fairly unassuming place form the outside but like stepping back in time inside. Great atmosphere and a classy style, but also very welcoming. Bartenders are brilliant and will customize your drink specifically to your tastes. Recommend to anyone who is passing through the area.",Date of experience: August 2016,Tandem Cocktail Bar,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Long weekend in St Ives!,"Just returned from a lovely 3 night stay at Channings.
Comfortable, immaculately clean, delicious breakfast, warm welcome from lovely hosts, great location to get to beach and shops/restaurants and the parking is a real bonus. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if we return to St Ives!!
Thank you.",Date of stay: July 2016,Channings,1,"St Ives, United Kingdom"
Lovely Eveing meal,"Managed to get a table on the day for 8 which isn't easy in St Ives...and was sat in the main restaurant overlooking Porthminster Beach.
The food, service and staff were all fantastic and very reasonable I thought. Would visit again.",Date of stay: July 2016,Pedn Olva Hotel,1,"St Ives, United Kingdom"
3RD best stay yet!,"Just returned from our 3rd year in a row staying at The Connaught for our lodge's ladies weekend. A really enjoyable and relaxing stay at a real gem perfectly located in Bournemouth, 5 mins to shops and beach and 2-3 minutes to bus tops for Poole.
The rooms, service and food are all top notch. The food was the best I've had in the years we've been visiting in my opinion. Staff; hard working, polite and attentive. The rooms were very comfortable, spotlessly clean and well furnished.
The spa facilities are very nice, in particular the fitness massage I booked during my stay. The mens changing rooms were a little dirty when we used them but that's a very small gripe in an overall great experience. Children are now no longer permitted in the pool between 12pm-6pm which was a little disappointing but I understand the reasons.
Looking forward to our next stay at the Connaught already!",Date of experience: February 2016,Bluewater Spa,1,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom"
Great Pub and Restaurant,"Ate here twice during our stay in Dunster. The food is brilliant and very reasonable. The service is welcoming, friendly and very efficient. Would recommend booking on weekends.",Date of visit: October 2015,The Stags Head,1,"Dunster, United Kingdom"
Unforgettable Experience,"Booked the Hawk Walk fo myself, my wife and our 10 year old son. Simply a must-do experience whilst visiting Exmoor. You get a real personal experience with the magnificent birds of prey and we learnt so much from Nigel. All this is made all the more amazing by the beautiful back drop of the Exmoor counrtyside.",Date of experience: October 2015,North Devon Hawk Walks,1,"South Molton, United Kingdom"
Delicious Sea Food Lunch,"Stopped off here for some lunch whilst visiting Lynmouth. We had the mussels, crab slate and oysters, washed down with a couple of ciders. All very delicious and the service was friendly and efficient. A little pricier than average but the quality justified it in my opinion. Definitely reccomend!",Date of visit: October 2015,Rising Sun Resturant,1,"Lynmouth, United Kingdom"
Breathtaking Scenery,"Possibly overlooked when visiting Lynmouth but well worth the short walk from Linton village to witness the spectacular rocky coastal views. Lots of different paths, some more challenging than others, and accessable by car park with toilets nearby. Warning, not for those with a fear of heights!",Date of experience: October 2015,Valley of the Rocks,1,"Lynmouth, United Kingdom"
Why dont i come here more....?,"Im ashamed to say that despite Al Verde being practically on my doorstep my recent visit was only my second.
The food is outstanding and the service is warm and friendly. The owner is a true gent who clearly cares a great deal about the restaurant, the food and especially the customers.
We will be back soon!",Date of visit: September 2015,The Ginger Italian,1,"Carshalton, United Kingdom"
Best Curry Around,"I've been going to th Blue Bengal for nearly 10 years and in my opinion its still the best curry around. Service is always great and everyone is really friendly, plus the food is always exceptional which is what its all about a the end of the day.
Hope to be visiting for another 10 years!!",Date of visit: September 2015,Blue Bengal,1,"Carshalton, United Kingdom"
Aston Martin & Radical thrill ride!,"I had 3 laps in the DBS and then a paasenger thrill ride in the Radical SR3.
Absolutely amazing experience, still buzzing from it 2 days later.
Registration is very quick and efficient as was the process of getting everyone in their respective cars and demo's. All the staff were really friendly and helpful and the instructors really helped me enjoy the experience.
Already thinking about my next trip....",Date of experience: September 2015,6th Gear Experience,1,"Chertsey, United Kingdom"
Brilliant holiday but a few gripes!!,"Arrived home from a 10 night stay with my wife and 10yr old son about a week ago.
A few negatives but overall this is a great resort.
We were staying in the 5000 block which is right by reception and between the main and kids pool. The rooms are a bit pokey and the beds were too hard for me. We found there was barely any space for clothes, just a wardrobe and a few very small drawers. The rooms were kept very clean though and we wasnt in there much.
The food overall was ok, some nights i enjoyed what was there, others i settled for soup. The whole trouser rule is a bit of a joke. There is only one place you can wear shorts at dinner (poolside rest) and you have to book. They claim its a 5* hotel so trousers must be worn but they need a reality check. The Italian restaurant is a must, kids can go on selected nights.
Evening entertainment was pretty good, the animation team are friendly and work very hard.
The drinks are what you would expect from an all inclusive.
The pools are the best feature in my opinion, main pool is huge and even when cowded there was space. The aqua park is great, about 5 min walk from receptio, no sunbeds or proper swimming area but the slides and kids splash stuff was brilliant, the snack bar was our prefferred option for lunch as well.
I would reccomend hiring bikes from the place next to the resort to see Kos town, 5 euros for the whole day. Also hired a car from reception for 50 euro, well worth it.
In summary, this is a huge resort with a lot of guests which made it feel a little impersonal and it'll take a few days to get your head round the restaurant situation, but all my moaning aside you'll be hard pushed to not have a great holiday staying here.",Date of stay: July 2015,Blue Lagoon Resort,1,"Kós, Greece"
Weekend break!,"Stayed for two nights late August. This is a fantastic Inn which was perfect for my wife and I as a base for exploring the area. We stayed in one of the annex rooms which was spotlessly clean, very comfortable and very spacious. Also, despite being close to the car park was very quiet! The pub itself is a nice traditional country inn with a good bar and lots of seating. We never had to wait long to be served and the food was great. Very family/dog friendly and a great central location for all the local sites.",Date of stay: August 2014,King Arthur's Arms Inn,1,"Tintagel, United Kingdom"
Stunning!,Incorporated this in to our coastal walk and its well worth the detour. Simply one of the most beautiful places I've visited!,Date of experience: August 2014,Rocky Valley,1,"Tintagel, United Kingdom"
Worth a quick visit!,"If you visit Tintagel for the castle, its well worth deviating towards the church which is only a short distance from the castle via the coastal path. Not only is it a quaint and interesting church and grounds, the views of the coast and castle are second to none!",Date of experience: August 2014,St. Materiana's Church,1,"Tintagel, United Kingdom"
Loved it!,"A must see while in the area. Only gave 4 stars as I felt there should have been more info at the various points scattered on the island. I bought the guide book which I had to keep referencing. Despite that, fantastic walk and views, as well as the dramatic ruins.",Date of experience: August 2014,Tintagel Castle,1,"Tintagel, United Kingdom"
Perfect.,"Stopped in for lunch after our hike from Tintagel. The timing was perfect as the sun just came out as we arrived so we sat outside. Nice spot by the harbour to see the village and people watch. Staff were efficient, friendly and the food/drink was lovely. Recommend!",Date of visit: August 2014,Harbour Light Tea Garden,1,"Boscastle, United Kingdom"
Quick Pint!,Stopped in for a quick pint while we waited for the bus. Service was very quick and the ale was good. Interesting interior as well.,Date of visit: August 2014,Cobweb Inn,1,"Boscastle, United Kingdom"
Great Fun!,"First thing worth mentioning is the ticketing system. You buy your tickets for an allocated show/tour time so best to get them in advance or maybe an hour before you want to visit then come back. I didnt find that very clear as we kind of walked in off the street. Even if you have merlin passes you still need to get tickets for the set time. Not a problem but its worth knowing in advance.
The experience itself was great fun. Really atmospheric and hats off to all the staff and actors who really add to the atmosphere. I wouldnt reccomend bringing children under 8, some of it is quite scary, although i did see a few younger who seemed to be enjoying it!
All in all, well worth a visit.",Date of experience: April 2014,The London Dungeon,1,"London, United Kingdom"
So disappointed!,"Couldn't wait to eat here as id heard lots of good things from friends (that was the kings road branch though). Booked in advance for 4.30, arrived at 4.00 and we waited at the bar for our table. Took 25 minutes to get two drinks! By 4:50 we've seen people arrive and be seated before us so i enquired with the hostess and amazingly we were finally seated.....we were then told there was no BBQ left (crushed) waited over 10 minutes and no one had even as much as looked at us let alone take any drink orders. It didnt bode well and we had a show to go to so decided to cut our losses and leave. Went across the road to Sticks n Sushi where the service was brilliant.
We spoke to the manager on the way out and were given an explanation, but by then i was so gutted by the whole experience that its really put me off trying again.
In the interest of fairness, i will say that on the few occasions we were attended to, the staff were very polite.
Would reccomend you go at lunch for any chance of getting the BBQ.",Date of visit: May 2014,Big Easy Bar.B.Q & Lobstershack,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Fantastic,"Visited with my wife before a show. Been to the Wimbledon branch before and enjoyed it and this was just as good if not better. Helpful friendly staff, seated straight away and food was great.",Date of visit: May 2014,Sticks'N'Sushi Covent Garden,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Great Weekend in Pembrokeshire!,"Had a long weekend staying at the Parsonage Farm Inn at the end of October. Great family friendly pub in a quiet picturesque village which is close to many of the local attractions and the coast. The staff were very friendly and helpful, giving us tips on things to do always happy to chat. The food was amazing with a wide selection including kids menu and i found it to be very reasonable and generous with portion sizes. I would reccomend Emma's sticky toffee pudding, it was worth the 4 hour drive itself!!
Stayed in a family room with my wife and 8yr old son and it was very comfortable and clean.
The village itself has another pub which and a small shop which sells all the basics.
Will definitely be booking again.",Date of stay: October 2013,Parsonage Farm Inn,1,"St. Florence, United Kingdom"
Great Holiday!,"Just back from a weeks holiday here. Had a fantastic all inclusive holiday. Very well run hotel with a huge choice of good food. Rooms are very nice and spacious and kept very clean. The hotel is literally on the beach so it was nice to mix it up and go in the sea as well as sit round the pool.
The majority of the guests are German but i never saw it as an issue and it certainly didnt make my holiday any less enjoyable so dont let that put you off. We did meet some British in the hotel and made some great friends.
The entertainment is very good during the day and in the evening and all the team are a good laugh and very friendly.
Went on the jeep safari with an outside company, Vigotours, highly reccomend, great day and great value. Would also reccomend a Turkish bath. Booked through Thomas Cook for my wife and 8yr old son who both really enjoyed it.
Side is is worth the trip as thr ruins are amazing, some great restaurants and shops too.",Date of stay: July 2013,Trendy Palm Beach,1,"Side, Turkey"
NICE!!,Nice restaurant overlooking the harbour. Food is delicious and the service is great. Cocktails aren't too bad either!,Date of visit: August 2013,Aphrodite Restaurant,1,"Side, Turkey"
