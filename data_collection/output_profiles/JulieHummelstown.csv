An Amazing section of Athens!,"The Plaka is fun anytime of day but at night against the lights of the Acropolis it is truly amazing. Lots of fun shops, great and affordable food and is great for people watching. They even have an open air cinema on the roof of one of the buildings in the Plaka that show Hollywood movies in English with Greek subtitles. Spent 3 nights in Athens and strolled the Plaka every one of them. Great gelato places here too.",Date of experience: September 2018,Plaka,4,"Athens, Greece"

Fun Day of Fishing the Greek Way!,"My daughter and I joined Captain Anthi and her crew for an amazing day on the water!
Not only did we see the beautiful coastine of southwest Santorini on an authentic wooden greek fishing boat but we were treated to a wonderful day of swimming , snorkeling, learning how to fish, catching fish and best of all eating fish! Captain Anthi made us feel so welcome and treated us like family. Anthi comes from a prominent fishing family in Santorini and shares her family's passion for it. We learned about the kind of fish we caught, some we could not touch (scorpion fish) but could eat and Captain Anthi made us aware of this. The feast on the boat was amazing and fish does not get any fresher than freshly caught. This excursion was a top highlight on our trip to Santorini. The nice thing about this excursion is that it is family run, not touristy but a wonderful cultural greek experience. This excursion is for people who like to fish and for people who just like to watch. Captain Anthi does have fishing excursions for more experience fisherman. Thank you Anthi for a great experience and wonderful memories!",Date of experience: September 2018,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Private Tour Of Santorini with the Experts!,"My daughter and I booked a custom private tour with Santorini Experts and had a wonderful time. We visited the the famous blue dome church in Firostefani, toured the capital Fira and Imerovigli and went on to Pyrgos the old capital of Santorini. we visited the Monastery there and saw amazing views. We also visited the Argyros Winery and Donkey Brewery. Santorini Experts were very helpful in planning our day.

Would definitely use again, very professional company.",Date of experience: September 2018,Santorini First Impressions Private Tour,4,"Santorini, Greece"

Amazing!!,See the acropolis first then go to the museum. Start on the third floor then work your way down. The museum design is brillant and is constructed to be a small Parthenon. The museum is designed to reinforce all you have learned while visiting the actual archaeological site.,Date of experience: September 2018,Acropolis Museum,4,"Athens, Greece"
"If You Are Touring Athens, You Need Angelos!","My daughter and I booked 2 private tours with Athens Walking Guide. One was a 4 hour walking tour of the city and the second was a 4.5 hour tour of the Acropolis and Ancient Angora. Angelos was simply amazing!! Very,very knowledgeable. We learned so much about Athens History. Our tours enriched our experience in Athens. Angelos was also very personable and really fun. He was always on time for our tours, always tailored our tours to what we wanted to see and took good care of us. He always made sure we had restroom breaks and even had bottled water for us.If you want an in depth history lesson along with great side facts and a tour guide who is passionate about his Greek history, Angelos is your guide!!",Date of experience: September 2018,Athens Walking Guide,4,"Athens, Greece"
A Wonderful Combination of a Spectacular Food and an Amazing Caldera View.,"My daughter and I dined at Lauda on September 11, 2018. It was Outstanding. The view was breathtaking and the food and service was 5 Star. The menu was so imaginative and different I could have eaten everything off the menu. Fresh fish, fresh ingredients, delicious innovative cocktails and exemplary service. We still talk about our meal, it was one of the best highlights culinary wise on our trip. All I can say is WOW!! The meals are pricey but worth every penny for the experience. I also have to mention we were given 3 chef welcome appetizers and chef welcome dessert-all amazing!!!",Date of visit: September 2018,Lauda Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Beautiful Resort with Amazing Staff and Sunsets!,"My daughter and I stayed at the Santo Maris September 11-13, 2018. What a beautiful Hotel. Modern Hotel with 2 pools, one infinity pool with pool bar at which you can see the famous Santorini sunset. We had a sea view suite which was very spacious, beautifully decorated and we had our own veranda complete with chaise lounge and outside jacuzzi. The On-site restaurant was excellent and the morning breakfast was to say the least a variety of any food you can imagine. The hotel staff was knowledgeable, approachable and willing to do anything to make your stay perfection. Three staff members come to mind: Katerina and Dora who worked at the pool/pool bar were amazing. Sylvis (I may have misspelled his name) was the greeter when we arrived-so very kind and helpful to us--thank you!! The Hotel has a Spa which was lovely and our stay included a free massage, do not miss the opportunity to do this. The property is gated with a door code. the property is in Oia but not on the caldera side. You follow a stone path from the hotel for a 10 min walk to the Main pedestrian street in Oia. This was wonderful because we had peace and quiet at the hotel and we had a short walk to the main town. Oia gets very crowded from the hours of 3pm-8pm for all cruise ship and santorini tourists want to see the sunset in Oia. Truth is, you do not have to go to Oia to see a great sunset. the main street in Oia was so crowded at times that you could not get through. After sunset, everyone leaves and the street is easier to navigate. The Santo Maris main restaurant overlooks the infinity pool where you can see a great sunset and miss the crowds. Overall and outstanding experience!! I would definitely stay at the Santo Maris again.",Date of stay: September 2018,Santo Maris Oia Luxury Suites & Spa,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Amazing Hotel in a Great Location.,"My daughter and I stayed at the Electra Palace September 8-11, 2018. The Hotel was incredible. Beautiful property with outstanding views of the Acropolis. Amenities included Concierge services, room service, 2 on sight great restaurants, one of which was on the roof with an incredible view of the Acropolis and an outdoor pool which is a plus if you are traveling to Athens during the summer. There was also a Spa on site with an indoor pool and work out room. Our room was air conditioned ( a plus) and beautifully designed. The Location was prime. We were in the Plaka district of Athens which was close to all major archaeological sites. We walked everywhere. The Staff at the Electra Palace was top notch in all respects. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely return.",Date of stay: September 2018,Electra Palace Athens,4,"Athens, Greece"
Always a great experience- jeff and staff first-rate!,We hiked as a family of 9. We have been using exclusive excursions for the last 4 years and have never been disappointed!! Hiking has been challenging and the views breathtaking. But this outfit is so much more than hiking. They have a variety of options and excursions and they build individual itineraries. We have had a great guide for 4 years but we donâ€™t want to tell their name! Keeping it our well kept secret! FYI you can include lunch and it is really good. Ask for the pumpkin cookies!! Thanks jeff !!,Date of experience: August 2018,Exclusive Excursions,4,"Park City, Utah"

Sweet Place to Visit,A fun spot to take people of ages. The Story of Hershey chocolate comes to life on the moving ride. You can make you own chocolate bar- fun for kids. Good eating area and great hershey milkshakes. Their is also a 3D short movie that is fun to watch. You buy all Hershey sourveniers here complete with clothing. There is a bakery consisting of everything chocolate plus a retail store with everything edible that the Hershey company produces. A great place to take out of town visitors.,Date of experience: July 2017,Hershey's Chocolate World,4,"Hershey, Pennsylvania"
Fun place to taste good beer,Troegs is a great spot for locals and visitors alike. You get to see how their beer is made. The small plate items are really good and they have a variety of beer samples you can try. There is an outdoor patio that is lit up at night. Inside can get a bIt noisy when crowded. They are working on expanding outside parking. A fun place to visit or meet up with friends.,Date of visit: August 2016,Troegs Brewing Company,4,"Hershey, Pennsylvania"
A fun place to visit if you like cars!,A fun place to see all kinds of classic cars and busses. You can learn about the different types of cars and the history and progression since the very first auto. A great place to take out of town guests. Not really a place for eating. I have been to a wedding there and it was very well done. One can also use this as a fun venue for parties or weddings.,Date of experience: September 2016,"AACA Museum, Inc.",4,"Hershey, Pennsylvania"
Fun Menu Spectacular Service,"Went to Cowfish twice for dinner with my family while staying in Orlando. The food is unique and fabulous. The sushi(try the lobster roll) was delicious and the burgers to die for. The Black and Brie burger was outstanding-blackberries and brie with sake soaked pears and arugula just melted in you mouth. The burger sushi combos were imaginative and the fusion of tastes were amazing. They serve the best milkshakes in all of Orlando. They are thick, creamy and sooooo good. The Key lime pie milkshake tasted just like key lime pie with a ring of graham cracker crumbs along the rim of the glass. Cannot say enough about the quality and quantity of the servings. Definitely worth the money. Their service is really outstanding for a restaurant at City Walk in Orlando. Mimi was our server and he did a fantastic job, could not have been improved upon. Spoke with the Manager and told him what a great time we had the first time that we came back for dinner a second time. Same great food and service. Our favorite restaurant in Orlando!! You rock Cowfish!!",Date of visit: June 2017,The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar,4,"Orlando, Florida"
WOW WOW WOW!!!!,"Dined at Blue Cilantro on June 23, 2017 with my family of 7 to celebrate my daughter's Birthday. We have been coming to the Cayman Islands since 1999 and have eaten at many of the island restaurants. Blue Cilantro is hands down the best restaurant in Grand Cayman!! We were seated in a room with beautiful glass windows so we could people watch along west bay road. The interior is very warm and inviting. Signature cocktails are wonderful and a very nice wine list The food is simply amazing!!! Had the grilled fresh catch on a mushroom risotto with truffle corn for dinner, scallops with a mango slaw for an appetizer and their amazing flat breads. some of these flat breads are served stuffed with delicious ingredients. They had a cake dessert in honor of my daughter to top off the evening. The wait staff is very knowledgeable and service is impeccable. Spoke with the Manager to tell him how fantastic his venue was. What a wonderful experience at Blue Cilantro! It will be my first stop for dinner on my next trip to the Cayman Islands. Blue Cilantro knocks it out of the park with their great food, service and ambience.",Date of visit: June 2017,Blue Cilantro,4,Grand Cayman
Great Food and Great Service,"First time At Sea, second trip to Bonaire. My family had a fabulous meal. From appetizers to dessert the food was fresh, innovative and absolutely delicious!!

An Amazing Adventure,"My family traveled to Bonaire in August 2016. We booked the cave tours with Leo from Flow Adventures. It was outstanding! Leo and his crew are very knowledgeable. They made the tour interesting, informative and fun but also kept in mind the safety factor in touring the dry and wet caves. The caves were amazing and a little challenging but well worth it. You have to be respectful of the environment that you are in Leo lets you know that up front. He really loves what he does and makes every effort to give you a great experience. When you go to the wet cave make sure you look out for the small shrimp and fish that inhabit the water. Awesome!!",Date of experience: August 2016,Flow,4,Bonaire
Second time around even better!,"My family of 8 returned to Bonaire in August 2016 and again stayed at the Harbour Village Beach Club (HVBC). It is an amazing place! The staff is friendly and helpful. Service is impeccable. We stayed in a home on the property and it was beautiful. close to everything and had every amenity our family needed. The restaurant on site is wonderful for breakfast, lunch or dinner. For my huband's birthday they had dinner on the beach for us and made him a delicious strawberry shortcake (his favorite). There is a lovely private beach with free paddle boards and kayaks. The Hotel is in a gated community so it is very private and relaxing. Again the rooms are decorated beautifully and the grounds are manicured. The concierge was happy to arrange all our tours and dinners in advance and they even provided groceries for us prior to our arrival. They also made sure we had transportation when we needed it. There is a pool on the grounds and a state of the art exercise room (the best i have ever seen) complete with a Spa with its own private pool waterfall. The spa offers an array of treatments to choose from. The HBVC is within walking distance to downtown restaurants and shopping. It is also close to the water taxis to Klein Bonaire where you can swim, snorkel and picnic. HBVC could not be in a better location. Christine Bell is the dive manager and she is outstanding. She booked all our diving and even planned a private snorkel/dive trip for our family on one of their dive boats. We went to the National Park to dive and snorkel then had wonderful lunch by a beach on the northern part of the island where our dive master introduced us to cliff jumping. We had so much fun. The island has plenty of things to do besides diving and HVBC can help you plan it all. HVBC has won awards for best small boutique hotels of the world and we can certainly understand why. We will certainly be returning to Bonaire and HVBC again.",Date of stay: August 2016,Harbour Village Beach Club,4,Bonaire
Another great restaurant,"Fresh innovative ingredients. On the ocean, beautiful views. Attentive staff. Menu is extensive. Modern romantic, nice ambiance and children are welcome. Had the Prosecco with cactus liquor made on the island-so refreshing!!",Date of visit: August 2016,Ingridients,4,Bonaire
Mrs,Always consistent great food and service! Their gyro wrap specials are the best. Could eat there every day! Soups are fabulous! Jess's chicken salad and the salmon and spinach are the bomb.,Date of visit: August 2016,The Chocolate Avenue Grill,4,"Hershey, Pennsylvania"
Amazing Vacation!,"My family spent a week at the Harbour Village Beach Club in June 2015. It was our first trip to Bonaire. This place is magnificent! The grounds are well manicured and beautiful.Some areas had walking paths under trellises covered with flowersl. Our accommodations were top notch, very nicely decorated and spotless. They have WiFi. The staff both inside the office and outside were very personable and made every effort to make your stay memorable. Jean Marc the general manage maintains high standards. Upon our arrival we had drinks, cool towels and fresh fruit. Melanie and Natasha at the front desk booked our tours, restaurants and taxis-they made everything so effortless for us. Christine, the Dive Manager was superb. She helped us with our dives and made sure we were in good hands. The on sight restaurant is excellent. It is an open air place with a roof- for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They also serve you drinks and lunch on the beach which was fun.They also have an outside lounge area to have drinks in the afternoon or evening. Their menu was varied and innovative. The HVBC beach is clean and dotted with chairs, hammocks, table for eating and the water is crystal clear and you can see parrot, trumpet fish within a stones throw from your beach chair. There is a nice out door pool that we never went to because the beach was so beautiful. HVBC also has a wonderful SPA facility with its own zen style private lounge pool. Their work out facility is state of the art--brand new up to date fitness equipment, weights, fans TV. There is also a game room and private tennis courts the guests can use.This facility is gated which means other tourists not staying there are charged a fee to use the facilities (I think it is $50/day). we didn't see any outside guests and you did not have to share your kayaks, body boards or snorkel equipment with the public. Other hotels on the island have their facilities for public use-and even if you are staying there, there is a chance you won't be able to get the kayak or snorkel gear for you own use. We didn't rent a car but HVBC has a few cab drivers that help them out with transporting guests. Ask for Dick-he is wonderful! Always on time, most courteous and fun to chat with. Also, HVBC is really in a nice location-you can get water taxis to Klein Bonaire and you have a short walk to downtown Kralendijk where the shops, restaurants and farmers market (fresh fruit and vegetables from Venezuela daily)are located. The Marina is right next to the HVBC so sunset cruises, fishing expeditions and sailing are right at your door step! Going back to HVBC this summer, can't wait!!!!",Date of stay: June 2015,Harbour Village Beach Club,4,Bonaire
Great Tour,This Kayak excursion is a must. Not only do you kayak among mangroves over 150 years old but you get to snorkel in them. The fish are amazing.

Mostly Glitz But Good Food,"This was a pretty new restaurant when we went. Glitzy and a little pricey for what you got. We waited for almost a half an hour to get drinks and bread. Food was very good, portions were small. Wait staff was slow and sometimes indifferent. No bang for your buck here. Sonia Home better food if you want Italian.",Date of visit: June 2015,Capriccio,4,Bonaire
Best Tour of the Island!!,Hands down Bonaire Vista Tours gives the best tour of the island. We had a 4 hr tour and saw everything but the National Park. Brian was an amazing tour guide and person!. He is an engineer who loves Bonaire and does tours as a hobby. He really knows all the history of the island plus geological and botanical highlights. He leaves nothing out.He also came prepared with waters and sodas for us on our tour. We really learned amazing facts about the island and its precious reefs and wildlife (flamingos). He was so good my two teenage boys even loved the tour! Thank you Brian for a wonderful day!!,Date of experience: June 2015,Discover Bonaire Sightseeing Tour,4,Bonaire
Disappointed,We had reservations and arrived on time. It was 45 minutes before we even were asked for a drink. No bread nothing. They had a big group in the center dining area that they were taking care of before anyone else. Over an hour later when we finally got up to leave did they respond. After all that the food was just okay. They gave us dessert on the house to smooth things over but we were done. Returning to Bonaire this summer and not going back there. Worst service I have ever seen.,Date of visit: June 2015,Bistro De Paris,4,Bonaire
Very Nice Ambiance Very Good Food,If you go make reservations for the table on the dock under a thatched roof. The view was magnificent and you are the only guests out there-very peaceful. The food was really good with something for everyone. Wait staff was a little slow but I think it is just the island way. Would definitely go back again.,Date of visit: June 2015,Sebastian's Restaurant,4,Bonaire
Italian food doesn't get any better than this!!,"We were visiting our daughter who was spending a month in SLC and planned on having dinner with her host family to thank them for letting her stay at their home. I was looking for a nice Italian restaurant and chose Valter's Osteria for our party of 10. It was unbelievably good!! Amazing!!! The restaurant looks exactly like the osterias I ate in in Italy-warm and inviting. The service was outstanding. There was so much to choose from the menu that our waiter suggested we do a sample appetizer and then a sampler pasta dish. The staff choose 6 items from each category so we could all have a taste. The food was plated for us and served. We had beef carpaccio with arugula, prosciutto with figs and pears, bruschetta, caprese salad, tuna tartare and for pasta we had ravioli in a cream sauce with shaved black truffle, gnocchi that were out of this world, angel hair in a limoncello cream sauce( amazing), butternut squash ravioli and then each of us had our second course of varying entrees such as veal piccata, salmon, beef etc. Valter the owner came to our table to make sure everything was perfect- and it was!! The dessert menu was wonderful- tiramisu , gelato, creme brÃ»lÃ©e and a few others. We were so stuffed we passed on dessert. Valter also came up to us as we were leaving and hugged us and said thank you for patronizing his restaurant. My daughter thanked him in Italian and he was so overjoyed by her response that he spoke back in Italian and said next time we come we will only speak Italian at dinner! Valter 's heart and soul is definitely in this restaurant and he makes you feel like family , in fact some of the menu items are his mother's recipes growing up. We will definitely return when in the area- DELICIOSO!!!! One more thing to add- the restaurant is upscale casual and the attire is casual. As for price to dine here- you can go $$ to $$$$ depending on taste, appetite and wine.",Date of visit: July 2013,Valter's Osteria,4,"Salt Lake City, Utah"
Still Perfect 10 years Later!,"My husband and I stayed at the SCC 10 years ago and had an absolutely wonderful time. We recently returned to Little Cayman with our 5 children to enjoy a low key, relaxing, diving vacation in paradise. We didn't stay at the SCC this time because of availability but enjoyed the activities SCC has to offer. The SCC is exceptional in food, service and friendliness! We were treated like family without even staying there! We did off shore fishing with Chris-caught 8 black-fins and a skip jack tuna. Chris is an outstanding fishing guide and the best on the island. He really does his homework to make sure you don't come off that boat empty handed! He is very knowledgeable, helpful and very personable. We also took a sunset cruise around Owen Island and had a excellent dinner at the SCC--everyone goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. Jen the GM was a big help in organizing our activities. Her emails were prompt and full of helpful information. She makes herself available all the time, is very approachable and really goes out of her way to make sure your stay is a memorable one. My family had a wonderful time and want to return to Little Cayman!! Who says you can never go home again was mistaken--Little Cayman and SCC always feel like home!",Date of stay: June 2013,Southern Cross Club,4,Little Cayman
Beautiful Beach!!,"At the tip of the island, great view of Cayman Brac. Big sandy beach, the water was clear and so refreshing because of the current feeding into the area. It is a hike to get to-have to use a scooter or car but well worth it. Excellent snorkeling. Has a little hut with picnic tables and there are lounge chairs available. Best beach on island!",Date of experience: June 2013,Point of Sand,4,Little Cayman
