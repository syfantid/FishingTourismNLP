The most beautiful day of my life from beginning to end <3,"I will never forget the day 23rd of May 2019 that I spent on a fishing tour with a traditional Greek fishing boat along the turquoise waters of the Ionian Sea around Zola. This was the most beautiful day in my life <3

I watched with delight the beaches available only from the sea: Amidi Beach, Fteri Beach, Kamari Beach, Kamari Caves and Blue Lagoon where we stayed for a lunch of the caught fishes and swimming. Xristina Karousou, Dionushs Gasparatos, Thaleia Stelatou and Christos Stelatous from Kefalonia Diving Center are so wonderful people, very friendly hosts, talented fishermen and even better cooks!

It was a real feast, lobsters, squid, several species of fried fish, wonderful Greek salad, even better cooked potatoes with vegetables, home-made cake and wine, fruits with cinnamon and honey... Everything tasted delicious in such a breathtaking surroundings that I have always dreamed of.

From the bottom of my heart I am thankful for paricipation <3

Highly recommend this trip! Very safe! Excellent!",Date of experience: May 2019,Kefalonia Fishing Tours,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
