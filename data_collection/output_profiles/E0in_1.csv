"Fun, friendly, relaxed","Did the morning/afternoon trip and we really enjoyed it. Anthi and her crew were so friendly and kind. As my girlfriend said, it felt like we were guests on a friends boat, such a friendly and relaxed atmosphere. Enjoyed the fishing and the snorkeling. And the lunch was great, the BBQ'ed octopus and the red snapper we caught were my favourite.",Date of experience: September 2017,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
