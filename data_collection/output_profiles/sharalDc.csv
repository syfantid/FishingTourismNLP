More noise came from the street outside at late night, early morning hours. The lobby area and bistro were clean and well attended. The Bistro staff were top notch and were very conscientious. The rooms were fairly clean, however the hallways and elevators were not.

I hadn't been here since being diagnosed with a dairy allergy. I learned that there were not many options for brunch for me. But, I made up for it by ordering a flight of mimosas - which were wonderful. Ultimately, I had scrambled eggs, bacon, and fruit.

I ordered the spring rolls - which were served fresh and crisp. The filling was great and the dipping sauce just enough to add some kick. The roast pork fried rice is a more than ample serving and could be shared by two for a true lunch portion. Coupled with the spring rolls it might even serve 3.",Date of visit: August 2015,Great Wall of China,4,"New Haven, Connecticut"

I was recognized by name and provided a new key and an apology for the extra step. While on the elevator returning to my room, a bellman followed up and offered to come up if I encountered additional issues with the room door.
The hotel is inside a national park and is surrounded by restaurants and activities. There were bike rental locations nearby and a Starbucks around the corner.

I booked a regular guest room during my business stay and ended up with a second floor room overlooking Matthias Church. Beautiful one of a kind view, but a bit noisy if you are awaking early for business every morning.
The room is well appointed with standards (iron, board, hair dryer, mini bar, coffee/tea service, television, phones and clock. The lighting is well done with extra emphasis on functional areas such as the closet and desk, with lower level lighting for bed. The AC is quiet and works well. The black out curtains function, but you need to strategically place them or you will have incoming light.
The complimentary breakfast is excellent with a wide variety of fare and very attentive and well trained staff. I have gotten excellent food and service each morning.

As others have stated, yes, the rooms are small - but remember it is a historic hotel. The baths are modern with newer fixtures and marble tiles. The rooms vary in size - My recommendation is to take advantage of the Hilton app and choose your room. That way you can select a larger room. The rooms do come with king beds. My room is appointed with desk, chair, flat panel TV, mini frig, and small closet. I chose a room that had a window on the inner courtyard - which is very quiet.

Excellent experience!,"Look no further for your home away from home in Kyiv. I stayed at Senator for about 3 months. This is an excellent apartment-hotel with a lovely staff. I was welcomed by name and was able to pay the bill for 30 days at a time. The hotel is in located in a great area with several restaurants, metro, several grocery stores, and drug stores nearby. It is very close to several of the key city sites and unique Ukraine experiences like Lviv Chocolate. Some of the great restaurants nearby include Fresh Factory and True Burger. The hotel lobby and rooms are well decorated and stylish. I ended up staying in three different rooms during my extended stay. My first night was in a regular hotel room which was quite nice. Both of the apartment rooms I had were very spacious! The service was excellent, the beds were extremely comfortable, the towels fat and fluffy. You are provided a robe, slippers, amenities, vanity kit, and even laundry soap. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable and professional. The hotel is very secure and the staff helpful with calling for cabs upon request.
The apartments have various floor plans and furnished with modern amenities. In my apartment, there was a kitchen with microwave, oven, electric kettle, and other basic utensils. There are hardwood floors in the large living room with comfortable sleeper sofa, chair, desk. The bedroom has a king/queen bed, large closet, a walk-in closet with small valuables safe. The bathroom is large with a tub/shower, well-lit vanity and sink, and washer/dryer. With only 20 apartments and a few regular rooms, the staff knows everyone by name.
For those who don't want to shop in one of the nearby grocery markets, Senator offers a stocking service for a small fee. They will shop for you and pick up the items you request. I will likely return to Senator upon re-visiting Kyiv.

Unique experience in Ukraine - Enjoy!,"Perfect for meat lovers (no so much for the vegan). A little hard to find - go through the church courtyard to the back or ask a local for directions. Lively entertainment accompanies the excellent grilled food. This was one of the highlights of our trip to Lviv. We had a large group of 5 and enjoyed great service. During our visit we saw a couple of ""sinners"" punished as well as the guillotine used to slice the giant 45 cm sausage with accompanying light show, Metallica, and fire breathing bartender.

Nice event center,"We visited the casino for one purpose - to see Frank Calliendo perform. The event center was clean and the staff friendly and helpful. The seats were pretty close for those of average or large stature. One thing to note - when purchasing tickets the seating is flat until you get to sections 3 or 4 (all the way in the back). So if you are short - get an aisle seat. There was smoking in the casino, but not in the event center. There was ample parking and a shuttle to all the neighboring hotels that ran every 15 minutes. There are ample food choices ranging from casual food court options to formal sit-down dining.

I do need to give special praise to Sam, at the front desk/reception. I had booked the wrong night. Instead of punishing me for an honest mistake, Sam promptly rebooked us into a similar room and got us into the hotel. I could have hugged her! I was so embarrassed already to have messed up the reservation, but to have to drive back home in a snowstorm around midnight would have been stressful to say the least. The free breakfast has loads of choices and there is a great selection of teas and coffee (and fresh cookies) 24/7. The beds were nice and linens comfortable.

Interesting History,"We enjoyed the lovely café while waiting for our English speaking tour guide (she was a delight!). The pastries and breads are made onsite and are relatively cheap. The tour began with our guide describing all the features and pointing out landmarks on the skyline so we could orient ourselves. We then walked over to the Lavra entrance and into a small chapel with marvelous paintings and frescos. I had worn a skirt that covered my knees and tall boots, but a friend had worn pants so she donned an apron like skirt over her pants before we could enter the caves. My husband had to remove his hat. Our tour guide narrated while we walked through the caves. She described each of the saints and how the monks stayed in solitude. Overall, this was a neat experience - extremely unique and a must see while in Kyiv.",Date of experience: December 2014,Kyivo-Pechers'ka Lavra,4,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine"
Amazing Chocolate,"Incredible chocolate - wonderful cozy café where you can order a cup of warm melted dark chocolate with cayenne pepper on it. Perfect for a cold day! I frequented the café throughout my 3 months in Kyiv. I brought friends and family to enjoy the coffee, ice cream, chocolate and treats. I also bought pounds of chocolate to bring home as gifts - much better than a cheesy souvenir for family and friends!! You can find this in Lviv and in Kyiv. The service is excellent and the staff helpful.",Date of visit: January 2015,Lviv Chocolate Factory,4,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine"

"New hotel, Great accessible rooms, Excellent staff","My recent stay at this hotel was for business. I found it was excellent for business travel. Due to late check in I ended up in an accessible room/ADA compliant across from the gym. The room was huge and well appointed with amenities that were height adjusted.

The hotel is very clean and has a lovely lobby. As a new property, some of the landscaping is still filling in - but that is expected right after construction.

The front desk staff, housekeeping, and breakfast staff were attentive and asked open ended questions. The general manager interacted with guests. The pool area was small but enclosed so it was very safe and you didn't feel like you were on display.

I would recommend rental car or Uber for getting around as cabs were hard to come by and unreliable. The gym included a treadmill, elliptical, cycle and free weights. I plan to stay here when returning for business in Houston and have already recommended it to a friend.

RFID room keys so no de-magnitizing by your phone. Very safe.",Date of stay: September 2014,Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites Houston Northwest-Brookhollow,4,"Houston, Texas"
Great staff and service,The Residence Inn at Aventura Mall is about 15 miles from MIA and offers free parking for those with rental cars. It is within walking distance to the mall where one can find numerous places to eat if you choose not to use the in room kitchens. The rooms are nicely appointed and offered the typical room with small kitchen. As an elite member I was provided a coupon for a free non-alcoholic beverage or item from the market store. The staff was very friendly and offered smiles and service. I will return during my visits to this area of Miami. It also seemed to offer pet-friendly service and was attractive to many families traveling as it was close to the beaches.,Date of stay: June 2014,Residence Inn by Marriott Miami Aventura Mall,4,"Aventura, Florida"

Great social & meeting facility,I needed to host a baby shower for my sister and Lauren was a great help! She responded to my emails quickly and we were able to arrange everything by phone and email. When we arrived the room was set up and a sign posted for the shower. We were able to decorate and have the guests without the drama of clean up. It was perfect for everyone involved. A few out of town guests stayed at the hotel and were very complementary of the rooms and amenities. The desk staff and Lauren (sales) were top notch and served the Hampton brand well. My only disappointment was the lack of table linens - but that was very minor. The tables and room were very clean. It is an excellent value!,Date of stay: January 2014,Hampton Inn Huntington University Area,4,"Huntington, West Virginia"
Wonderful choice for MoA,"The Blu at Mall of America is wonderful - a nice modern respite from the cold. The lobby is fresh and has a very popular lounge area fondly referred to as ""The Nest"" by the staff. Large chairs fit for two or more sit near a large open fireplace perfect for those cold winter nights. Registration and bell staff are attentive and charming. You venture up an escalator to the restaurant, concierge, and elevators to the rooms. I reviewed the restaurant, Fire Lake Grill House, as well. Rooms are very nice and cozy. Ample furnishings and novel placements of traditional fixtures such as the luggage rack were a nice surprise. The concierge services were very good though I had only a few interactions. The mall is easily accessible from the hotel with no need to venture outside. Overall this was an excellent stay that I would recommend to friends and family.",Date of stay: January 2014,Radisson Blu Mall of America,4,"Bloomington, Minnesota"
Fit for a foodie!,"I was delighted with the service and food at Fire Lake. As someone who can't have any dairy due to an allergy, I let the server, Steven, know once we were settled in. Steven explained the various dishes on the menu and substitutions that could be made to accommodate my needs. It was a large group of business associates and we started our culinary journey with some of the fresh squeezed lemonade and the wonderful house cheese boards which included local delights. Steven, knowing my allergy added several non-dairy options in small dishes to accompany the cheese boards. I ordered a delicious filet with grilled asparagus sprinkled with sea salt. It was delightful. At our request, Steven brought out an assortment of desserts to share (and was attentive enough to leave the whipped cream off the fresh berries, instead garnishing them with mint). We finished the meal with coffee and again I was pleasantly surprised to find the restaurant stocked almond milk. Without hesitation I ordered a cappuccino and it did not disappoint.

Hidden neighborhood gem!,"Wow! Excellent breakfast and terrific coffee. I found this through reviews on TripAdvisor and am thrilled I did. A business colleague and I skipped breakfast at the hotel and drove over to Sweetsalt. What a treat it was. We were there at 8 when they opened up and locals came in gradually as we enjoyed our meal. I had a terrific wild mushroom omelet topped with microgreens, cafe americano with almond milk, and orange juice. The tables are fun and homey. Staff is very friendly and food deliciously prepared.

"Excellent steaks, desserts, and service","As a foodie, I like to review the restaurants that perform above expectations and I do a lot of research when traveling so that I hit the best as well as the undiscovered. We were impressed immediately with the service. Though expensive, the food was well prepared and delicious. I ordered a salad and was able to shared with the other two in my party. My next course was the filet (butterflied and prepared medium well) with a side of spinach Abe & Louie's style. The steak was fantastic - perfectly seared and tender. Dessert was the topper - wonderfully served warm from the oven. I included a photo which does not do justice to the delightful dessert. Great place for a celebration or special event.",Date of visit: September 2013,Abe & Louie's,4,"Boston, Massachusetts"
"Great lobby restaurant, comfy beds","I was pleasantly surprised with this property. The lobby is newly renovated and very comfortable with lots of gathering spots.

Storage was ample and the room well appointed with several lighting options, ironing board/iron, hair dryer, flat screen, etc. The couch was comfortable and a nice option for lounging.
The bed was very comfortable and bedding clean and fresh.

Breakfast was great and prices reasonable.",Date of stay: September 2013,Courtyard Richmond North/Glen Allen,4,"Glen Allen, Virginia"
Conference and Meeting Destination,"I stayed while attending a conference. First, the conference facilities and meeting rooms were excellent. The catering service and a/v folks were attentive and very helpful. The rooms were cleaned often and set up perfectly for what we needed. The food available in the onsite restaurants was good - but pricy. The buffets were the best deal - my favorite was the soup salad and dessert buffets - $19, instead of the ""everything buffet"" which was over $30. The desserts were excellent and there was plenty of protein on the soup and salad bar. The bar had a great happy hour and some good ""bar food"" that ended up being the best place to eat and chat post-meeting. The rooms were a walk - and at altitude some may find it difficult. My room was fairly clean, but I did find two small bugs on one of the two beds in the room. I figure they hitched a ride in as they were not bed bugs. The balconies were nice and mine overlooked the golf course offering nice views of the mountains. A colleague was in a different ""lodge"" and his stay wasn't as pleasant. The A/C went out during the stay and at one point his room reached well over 85 degrees making sleep difficult. There were neat amenities for conference goers such as smores in the evenings and plenty of free water.",Date of stay: June 2013,"Cheyenne Mountain Resort Colorado Springs, A Dolce Resort",4,"Colorado Springs, Colorado"

There is a small pool and exercise room - but really, who needed it when you could easily walk to fun Seattle attractions. There are great rooms with a view of the Space Needle.

"Clean, close to metro","Our reservation was handled well. However, while checking in one of the clerks made a negative comment about the neighborhood where our home is located. As a regular customer of Marriott hotels, I was surprised by it. We chose this hotel because they listed themselves as pet friendly. I notified our clerk of our pet and he promptly had us sign the pet policy and agree to the $150 pet fee. Though technically pet friendly, the hotel charged us more than the nightly rate for our cat to be in the room with us - I found this less than ""pet friendly.""
The room was very clean and most of the fixtures were in working order. One light over the suite's kitchen sink was out and a few dishes were missing, but overall the suite was fully functional and a nice respite. The high speed internet was quick and free. Breakfast was great and included eggs, sausage, biscuits and other hot foods as well as fruit, cereal and pastries.

Food and fun for all,"We were looking for a place for brunch on a Sunday morning - and ended up at Top Golf. We ate a great brunch with good service from Jayme. I had the french toast with coconut rum batter (yum!), the others in my party enjoyed the Spanish omelet and the steak and eggs. The home fried potatoes were excellent with just a hint of rosemary for a savory seasoning. Who would have thought you could get such great food at a golf venue?
We then played 18 in miniature golf starting with the ""River"" course. It was warm so we hit the clubhouse for sodas and then went out for a second 18 on the ""Mountain"" course. It was tougher and raised the required skill level. This is great for all ages - we saw couples playing, small family groups with young children as well as more mature groups enjoying the courses. The driving range is great with a ""dart board style"" targeting system. When using the micro-chipped balls you can keep score, play competitively or just work on your game.

The restaurant has an excellent selection of appetizers, plety of vegetarian fare, and good desserts. The bread was my favorite as it was delivered fresh and warm with plenty of oil, balsamic and butter to accompany as you chose.

The service was great and our drinks kept full. We had the beer battered mushrooms for an appetizer. They were served fresh and hot with ranch dressing for dipping.

Challenging Entertainment!,"We spent a little over two hours on our adventure which involved a mystery to be solved at the National Gallery of Art.

We would do this again and look forward to other hunts that are offered in DC and in other cities. The hunt involved lots of walking around the galleries so you should wear comfortable shoes. You will get a pen and answer sheet to record what you find. There are prizes of other hunts if you win the hunt or the feedback drawing.

One light over the suite's kitchen sink was out and a few dishes were missing, but overall the suite was fully functional and a nice respite. The high speed internet was quick and free. Breakfast was great and included eggs, sausage, biscuits and other hot foods as well as fruit, cereal and pastries.
The garage was easily accessed and parking ran $18 a day with unlimited in/out. There are several restaurants and a movie theater nearby as well as two metro stops. Our 15th floor room was quiet and the elevators quick when called.",Date of stay: July 2012,Residence Inn by Marriott Alexandria Old Town South at Carlyle,4,"Alexandria, Virginia"
Food and fun for all,"We were looking for a place for brunch on a Sunday morning - and ended up at Top Golf. We ate a great brunch with good service from Jayme. I had the french toast with coconut rum batter (yum!), the others in my party enjoyed the Spanish omelet and the steak and eggs. The home fried potatoes were excellent with just a hint of rosemary for a savory seasoning. Who would have thought you could get such great food at a golf venue?
We then played 18 in miniature golf starting with the ""River"" course. It was warm so we hit the clubhouse for sodas and then went out for a second 18 on the ""Mountain"" course. It was tougher and raised the required skill level. This is great for all ages - we saw couples playing, small family groups with young children as well as more mature groups enjoying the courses. The driving range is great with a ""dart board style"" targeting system. When using the micro-chipped balls you can keep score, play competitively or just work on your game.
Bathrooms were clean and the course well-kept. Parking is easy! For unlimited mini golf, the price is $8 a person - a great deal!",Date of experience: June 2012,TopGolf Alexandria,4,"Alexandria, Virginia"
Great free museum,"Small and off the beaten path, the US Patent and Trademark museum is close to the metro at King Street. It is a great diversion off the normal tourist path and offers rotating exhibits. Add in a stop in Old Town with plenty of eating establishments and other activities.",Date of experience: June 2012,National Inventors Hall of Fame Museum,4,"Alexandria, Virginia"
Excellent service and authentic Italian,"Pricci was recommended by our hotel in Buckhead. We obtained a reservation and were seated at a table with a view of the entire restaurant. Our cicular booth was great for people watching. Our server, Marco, displayed the poise and customer service of a professional. He knew the menu and provided top notch service. The restaurant has an excellent selection of appetizers, plety of vegetarian fare, and good desserts. The bread was my favorite as it was delivered fresh and warm with plenty of oil, balsamic and butter to accompany as you chose.
The restaurant is owed by a group that also owns two other establishments in Buckhead. We dined at 2 during our trip and were impressed by the service at both. Each offered a unique expereince and great food options.",Date of visit: June 2012,Pricci,4,"Atlanta, Georgia"
Wonderful Med Food,"Overall, Kyma is an excellent choice for Mediterranean food in the Buckhead area. The restaurant, recommended by our hotel, was wonderful. We had a reservation for 6:45 and were seated immediately upon arrival. Our server, Leanne, was great and knew the menu well. She offered specials and recommendations for sharing. Our party of three business associates ended up sharing multiple mezas. The food is excellent and servings ample. Great atmosphere with just the right noise level. We were not rushed and enjoyed great conversation while enjoying the wonderful dishes. Service is excellent - and expected by the parent company of Kyma.",Date of visit: June 2012,Kyma,4,"Atlanta, Georgia"
Good pub food and great service,"After reading reviews for various options in Manassas, we chose the Philadelphia Tavern. We enjoyed a great meal and the pub atmosphere. Settled in downtown Mannassas near the Amtrack station, the pub offers great beer-battered fish and chips as well as Philly Cheesesteaks and other ample sized sandwiches. The service was great and our drinks kept full. We had the beer battered mushrooms for an appetizer. They were served fresh and hot with ranch dressing for dipping. There was plenty for our party - especially considering the size of our entrees! The homemade chips and fries are great and a bonus when getting a sandwich or fish. Great choice!",Date of visit: June 2012,The Philadelphia Tavern,4,"Manassas, Virginia"
Challenging Entertainment!,"We spent a little over two hours on our adventure which involved a mystery to be solved at the National Gallery of Art. The hunt was an excellent way to see works I hadn't seen in other trips to the museum. The two hour time limit was perfect and each team started with a different clue so there wasn't a crowd all going for the same information.
We would do this again and look forward to other hunts that are offered in DC and in other cities. The hunt involved lots of walking around the galleries so you should wear comfortable shoes. You will get a pen and answer sheet to record what you find. There are prizes of other hunts if you win the hunt or the feedback drawing. Check them out at watsonadventures<dot>com for hunts in LA, Chicago, DC, NY, Philly, and other cities.",Date of experience: June 2012,"Watson Adventures Scavenger Hunts - Washington, D.C.",4,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"
"Great shakes, sandwiches and salads",The chocolate malts are great on a summer day. And the sandwiches are toasted with fresh bread and lots of fresh toppings. The Uptown and the Farmhouse salads are wonderful.,Date of visit: June 2012,Potbelly Sandwich Shop,4,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"
Nice for dinner,"While traveling on business, we found Patrick's. It was quiet on this Monday evening but still had the televisions on so we could watch the various games and even DWTS. The blackened Mahi Mahi was good and the desserts. The red velvet cake was not a bad way to end a meal. Others in the party enjoyed items from the appetizer and salad menus. Meghan, our server, was attentive, but not overly so.",Date of visit: May 2012,Patricks 1481,4,"Sarasota, Florida"
Loved the food - a great place for breakfast and lunch.,"The menu had some great selections for brunch and lunch. The service was great and we enjoyed our ""pick two"" selections. The sandwiches are fresh and the salads full of goodies! The pick two option was a perfect way to try a couple of items, but not over eat or over spend.",Date of visit: May 2012,First Watch,4,"Sarasota, Florida"
Good spot for lunch with great home style Cuban,"Great place to grab lunch near the airport. The food was good and cooked home-style. Service was good and attentive. The pork is excellent. Nice ""mom & pop"" style restaurant.",Date of visit: May 2012,El Rinconcito Latino,4,"Miami, Florida"
Excellent meal with great service! A treat for foodies!,A great example of well-done farm to table cuisine. Our party of four started off with the Parmesan beignets trimmed with pear and thyme which were delightful. We each chose one of the market fresh fish. I had perfectly cooked flounder with almonds and perfectly accompanied with fingerling potatoes and peach salsa. It went nicely with a glass of Stemmari Pinot. My meal was completed with a wonderfully fresh trifle. The atmosphere was great - we dined outside on the porch in a lovely Sarasota evening. I will be returning next time I am in town.,Date of visit: May 2012,Indigenous,4,"Sarasota, Florida"
Nice change from the typical hotel,"This was my first stay at this great find in Sarasota. The hotel is clean, up-scale, and airy. The staff is wonderfully attentive and can help with any need. Upon check-in, I arrived at my room to find it cool and airy with a delightful cd playing of soothing music. The staff suggested restaurants and outings when asked. The Aveda spa products (lotion, shampoo, conditioner) are great in the rooms and have a rosemary mint scent. There is a bike rental station right outside for quick (or leisurely) rides over to Main Street or St Armand's for drink, dinner or sunsets. The A/C units are a little loud, but by the second night I had adjusted to the off/on noises. The furnishings are nice and even include a tray for breakfast in bed. I will look for more Indigos as the atmosphere was upscale without the pompousness.",Date of stay: May 2012,Hotel Indigo Sarasota,4,"Sarasota, Florida"
Marriott service and great location,"I stayed for a business trip but thought it would be nice to stay at South Beach. The Marriott South Beach offered all the comforts and amenities you expect from Marriott hotels. I loved the convenience of the Starbucks attached to the hotel. The service was good and the rooms clean. It is a good location - right on the beach, a great pool area, and close enough to the attractions, but far enough from the night life that you can still sleep.",Date of stay: May 2012,Marriott Stanton South Beach,4,"Miami Beach, Florida"
"Great breakfast, cozy atmosphere.","While traveling on business, we dropped into ""The Breakfast House"" for our morning meal. The four in our party each found something to enjoy on the menu. Our orders ranged from omelets (one ""make it yourself"", the other a set combo) served with home fries and toast, to ""Island Style Pancakes"" (a fabulous pancake with a pineapple ring grilled in served with coconut, butter and maple syrup) and ""Creme Brule French Toast"". Our food was delicious and offered unique flavor pairings. Service was good - all be it feisty. All in all - we'd go back!",Date of visit: May 2012,The Breakfast House,4,"Sarasota, Florida"

Holy Guacomole! Outstanding food and service,"We arrived just at our reservation time and were seated immediately. Our server was delightful and had excellent recommendations of top choices. We were seated at a window booth and enjoyed an excellent view of the harbor and Potomac. The sunset brought pinks and oranges into the already colorful decor. Our guacamole expert came by and whipped up a fresh batch at our table. Served with chips and fresh cooked white corn tortillas, it was a perfect appetizer for two.
We had a celiac int he group and needed his meal to be gluten free (GF). It was and he was thrilled with the variety of the GF choices. I ordered of the specials and was pleased with the beef enchilada with mole blaca sauce. The sopapillas are a great way to top off the meal and my favorite. And the GF choice for dessert is a trio of house made sorbets and ice creams. Best one is the Mexican Chocolate, hands down.",Date of visit: March 2012,Rosa Mexicano - National Harbor,4,"National Harbor, Maryland"
Excellent for lunch with great service too,My colleague and I dropped in without a reservation about 11:20 on a Friday for lunch. We were seated immediately at a window table with a great view of Georgetown street activity. Our server was attentive and offered specials and spotlighted favorite selections. We chose a cream of potato soup with hints of squash and carrot. The soup was delicate and a nice way to warm up. We then split an order of sliders and were delighted when the server brought the order split on two plates with some house-made potato chips. Each plate was garnished and presented as if a separate entree. We were offered coffee and dessert and the service continued to be top drawer.,Date of visit: March 2012,Clyde's of Georgetown,4,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"

Yum!,We dropped in to purchase a dozen to share with co-workers ($30 for the dozen). The assortment was great and the service attentive. The cupcakes were phenomenal - my favorite for March is the Irish Creme - chocolate with butter cream and a hint of Bailey's with a shamrock to finish it off. Wonderful!,Date of visit: March 2012,Georgetown Cupcake,4,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"
Great venue and a variety of shows,Kennedy Center is one of our favorites - we take advantage of the variety of quality free entertainment as well as the pay performances.

Treated wonderfully and a very accomodating staff,My stay at the Douglas Hampton Inn was very good. My room on the 3rd floor was clean and well maintained. The room was very comfortable. Breakfast was as expected but what set this over the top with the attentive service from the staff. The manager and the front desk staff were very welcoming and provided an nice environment for our group to meet and talk during our stay. The housekeepers were very courteous and helpful with any requests we had during our stay. I would choose to stay here again.,Date of stay: February 2012,Hampton Inn - Douglas,4,"Douglas, Georgia"

Thanksgiving option -,"This was the second year we ate at Wildfire on Thanksgiving. Last year, we enjoyed wonderful service, excellent food, and good ambiance. This year was nothing like last year. Needless to say, we were disappointed. Previously, service was efficient and you felt like a valued customer. This year, we waited over 5 min to even get water at our table. In the past, we received a package of food to take home - and since it was Thanksgiving dinner, it was a lovely touch to be able to take home ""leftovers."" Unfortunately this year, we only received the few pieces of asparagus and some turkey that were left behind on the family-style serving dishes. Maybe, it is the economy, but I was saddened to not have the great experience I did last year.",Date of visit: November 2011,Wildfire - Tysons Galleria,4,"Tysons Corner, Virginia"

Great food and good facilities,I have visited the NCC five times now in the past six months for various training sessions. Each visit has been unique but the consistent thread has been the wonderful staff and great food. The facilities are perfect for small or large conference gatherings and offer myriad breakout and plenary rooms. Attendees are also able to use the gyms to keep up exercise routines and it is close enough to Leesburg to enjoy the attractions. A good deal!,Date of stay: February 2012,The National Conference Center,4,"Leesburg, Virginia"
