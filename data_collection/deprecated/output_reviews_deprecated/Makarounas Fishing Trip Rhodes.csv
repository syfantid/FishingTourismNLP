0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stavros50,October 2020,5,Fantastic birthday trip,"Saw this trip advertised as we were walking along the Harbour . Did some checking and found it to be very highly recommended. Paid the ‚Ç¨20 deposit and went on our merry way . Thursday ( my 50th birthday ) arrived and we were at the Jetty for 08:50 to fill in documentation and comply with COVID restrictions ( temperature test etc) . Skipper of the boat met us and assisted with our and other guests boarding .  When all were seated he took us around the ancient harbour for great photo shots and then out to a fishing ground .  The first mate ( skippers wife) laid out bait and fished out rods and gear .  Scupper gave advice on what to do as well as safety brief on type of poisonous fish in these waters.  On completion we went at it . Weather was great . A little swell in the water but great for fishing . I pulled four fish in ( much to my delight) . No record breakers but great sport. Following a change of fishing ground, we headed south down the east coast of Rhodes.  Drinks were available throughout and acquaintances made with fellow fishermen. Arrived in a secluded cove with sea caves and tied off .  Swimming and exploring were the name of the game as the crew prepared a feast of BBQ fish and Greek salad ( tasted fantastic). On completion we headed North back to port .  A fantastic day out . Felt safe and secure throughout and have memories of a most wonderful day. The price was very fair (‚Ç¨100 for two adults) and I would happily go again . Fully recommend this to both novice and expert purely for the joy of the day.  Was very surprised when the skipper produced a chocolate cake with a candle and sang happy birthday to me ..... it‚Äôs the little things that count as well .  Amazing day  Amazing crew  Thank you very much .‚Ä¶"

A few of us felt sick and they moved to calmer waters, checking everyone was ok. They had a good knowledge of fishing spots and assisted the less experienced! ( me).
