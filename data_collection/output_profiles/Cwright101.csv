Typical Greek Hotel. Excellent,"If you want Pizza and chips, loud music, entertainment and in the middle of everything , this is not the hotel for you. If you want peace and quiet, good Greek food and friendly hospitality this is the place to stay. 100 m from the beach 100 m from a few shops, bars and hotels. The bus stop to Rhodes Town is 5 min walk. The staff are hardworking and very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Yes its on the flight path, but there tends to be a couple of planes then nothing for an hour or so. You do get used to it and they stop before midnight. Small snack bar selling drinks and food. Good value. Large swimming pool and small baby pool, there is a small collection of slides and toys for the children, Well tended gardens as with all Greek Hotels a few cats but they do go away.",Date of stay: June 2019,Sabina Hotel,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Such a special fishing trip,"We went out on the afternoon trip, just two couples had booked the trip, early June so less travellers. We were made to feel so special, guidance and help for fishing. Swimming in the sea and a bit of boat sightseeing too. It was my husbands birthday and he was given a candle in his sweet and greetings sung to him. There is a toilet on board. The presentation of the food was outstanding. Good choice of drinks.",Date of experience: June 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Weekend away.,"Would rate this as good rather than average . Basic accommodation could do with a bit of TLC ,bed needs tightening up and the table and chairs were adequate for the weekend. Clean and tidy. New kitchen with lots of storage space. Nice views, simple walks around the site. Lots of birds, squirrels to watch.And the site is very peaceful. Would come back again. £15 deposit for electric, we used less than £3. Log sacks were £5.",Date of stay: March 2019,Sherwood Castle Holiday Forest,4,"Newark-on-Trent, United Kingdom"
clean nice hotel,"We stayed here for one night, the room was smaller than expected, but enough room for two people. Clean and tidy. The pool was smaller than expected and changing rooms had no cubicles, but not too far from the bedrooms. The lounge/bar area is like someone else said a bit like a gentleman's club but in keeping with the hotel. Yes some of it is dated but to be honest modern furniture would not be in keeping with the hotel. Check in was very quick, and 2 hours earlier than stated. All the staff were friendly and polite. Breakfast buffet style lots of choice and freshly cooked. We had lunch in the bar good standard and value for money. Would stay here again.",Date of stay: March 2019,Carlton Park Hotel,4,"Rotherham, United Kingdom"

quick late lunch,"we arrived at 3pm for lunch, absolutely no bother for the staff. The food was well cooked, beautifully presented and tasted amazing, above our expectations. Both meals Scotch burger and Jacket potato with haggis were delicious and we didn't want them to end. Friendly staff .",Date of visit: September 2018,Olive Tree,4,"Newcastleton, United Kingdom"
Night away,"The room in the annex was larger than expected, yes the furniture is dated but in keeping with the room and the age of the hotel, it is clean and well kept. Very quiet hotel. The garden down to the river is wonderful and well tended, lovely place for a drink. Breakfast was well cooked and plenty of choice. The staff were very busy and some people had to wait for tables to be cleared but this was done quickly and cheerfully with apologies, but they were trying to serve lots of people at the same time, so i think they were trying to get hot food out and clearing the tables was done last. Will definitely be coming back.",Date of stay: September 2018,The George Hotel,4,"Piercebridge, United Kingdom"
What a disappointment.,"We stayed here for one night on a Sunday, quick check in, although we know now why they want payment in advance. Wonderful room with views across the well tended gardens and the city.I do feel the electrics in the room need looking into, bulbs above the lampshade hot to touch, and the bulb in the bathroom was hanging down. Until the Indian restaurant opened and played their music. The speakers are in their ceiling and this means if you have the ground floor room the music is very loud. We did complain and were moved to another room on the first floor where you could not hear it, although this room was not as comfortable. We ate in the Indian restaurant the food is amazing and the music is quieter in there than the bedroom. On returning to the hotel the main door was unlocked and no staff on site just a phone number to contact if there was a problem. We arrived for breakfast at 9:03 to be told by the waitress there was nothing left. We spoke with the manager who said the chef had left and they could cook us some eggs but not bacon. We asked for £20 back to go and get breakfast somewhere else. To be told no as we were late for breakfast ( ok we were by only 3 minutes). I think the waitress was right they had no food left. They could not give money back as they did not have any and did not operate this way.",Date of stay: September 2018,Farnley Tower Guesthouse with onsite Restaurant and Bar,4,"Durham, United Kingdom"
mid week break,"lovely small site. Did not feel too close to the other caravans. Well kept grounds friendly staff. 10 mins walk to the local beaches. Easy to get around Northumberland in the car. Small fairly well stocked shop with prices as expected as no other shop in the village. Check in took less than 4 minutes, pleasant staff. We did not use the pool or bar so can not comment on them.",Date of stay: September 2018,Cresswell Towers Holiday Park,4,"Cresswell, United Kingdom"
breakfast and a walk,"lovely breakfast, high quality local produce, freshly cooked to order. Good Baytown coffee. Nice service. beautiful surroundings followed by a walk down to the lake. There is a play area for children. You can also buy plants for the garden. And Lollie the dog will take you for a walk. A unique experience.",Date of stay: September 2018,The Grainary,4,"Scarborough, United Kingdom"

"Informative talk, amazing props","You need to prebook timed tours We were shown around by Nick, i have done many tours around the world and never met someone so passionate and knowledgeable about his job, you were made to feel this one the first time he had told this story and was excited to tell it, he did not just repeat facts and answered questions in a delightful way to adults and children. tasting of small samples, making your own chocolate lolly.",Date of experience: April 2017,York's Chocolate Story,4,"York, United Kingdom"
Good value,"Good value hot well cooked food, nice clean establishment, friendly staff. good choice of food, but read the menu, i don't like BBQ style food and the menu appeared to have mainly this under the smokehouse heading, but it is not all that type. Nicest 'pub cooked' steak i have had.",Date of visit: February 2017,Tunny Catch,4,"Scarborough, United Kingdom"

winter sun holiday,"Beautiful hotel, needs a bit of TLC in some areas. I would book a top floor seaview room we were in room 524 and had a view of the sea and the gardens, this is a large hotel and the views lower down could be limited because of the trees. The choice of food at breakfast and dinner was very good, always hot and replenished several times throughout the sittings. Gluten free food bar available. Very friendly staff and as it was my birthday whilst we were there, they gave me champagne, chocolates , balloons and fruit free of charge, and when my husband asked for a cake we had a beautiful chocolate cake at our specially reserved table complete with tablecloth and linen covered chairs. We like a firm mattress and as others have said the beds are hard but not a problem to us. The rooms are very spacious including tub chairs with coffee table and the balconies have table and chairs too. The Tv has BBC world news and sky news but as this is Spain foreign channels are expected not sure what the other reviewer expected. Large open spaces in the public areas.The gardens are well maintained and yes a few sun loungers need replacing but enough to go round even so. Not many bars in the area but that also suited us and those few that are there are clean and very friendly. Slight incline down to the beach. Enjoyed the short talk in the observatory in the grounds. Mainly older guests, they do have a kids club but not much more for children in the area. Easy to use local buses to get around the island. Looking forward to returning again.",Date of stay: December 2016,Sol La Palma Hotel by Melia,4,"La Palma, Spain"
whales and dolpjins,This is a great trip even if you don't see any whales or dolphins. We were lucky enough to see both but these animals are in their natural habitat so not guaranteed. But the crew spend a lot of time looking for them. Very informative crew member from Brighton UK (sorry forgot your name ). Clean and tidy boat we did the lunch time trip and the soup was excellent.,Date of experience: December 2016,Fancy II Whale Watching,4,"La Palma, Spain"

WONDERFUL STAY,"This hotel has only been opened a couple of weeks since refurbishment so there are a few minor teething problems, as the previous comment suggests. The phones are now in the rooms along with waste baskets, the meal times are posted around reception and the restaurant along with the 3 shuttle services for the mini bus. We stayed w/c 4th June and the spa was almost ready just waiting for some doors and health and safety inspection. The hotel is up a hill and away from everything, there are a few tavernas and 2 mini supermarkets at Keri beach so if you need lots to do on holiday this is not for you. The hotel is clean and tidy and every member of the staff will do anything to make your stay the best. The 'cheaper' rooms are good size with a/c and patio or balcony to sit out on. the Bathrooms vary from each room but all have everything you need. All the rooms aver very spacious. The walk to keri beach seemed to vary from 30 to 60 mins depending on who you spoke to, but there is a shuttle bus 3 times a day .We had a lovely walk among the olive and pine trees up the hill from the hotel. There is some entertainment greek dancing, bingo ( Mike will get the hang of this by the end of the season !) and a band but thankfully not every night and nothing in the daytime to allow you to totally relax. The pool is clean and long enough for a good swim. We can not wait to go back.The food in the restaurant is well cooked and tasty, maybe not as many dishes as other AI but enough choice and hot. There is a special cooking area too, where everything is cooked as you want it, different choice each meal. The bar is payable after 11pm but the measures of the drinks is ample and good quality.",Date of stay: June 2016,Keri Village & Spa by Zante Plaza,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"

Brilliant,"lighthearted, informative and so relaxing. Even though we had our own hired boat found this trip funny and educational in equal amounts. Worth the trip to see the on board swallows nest.

don't want to wait another 5 years.,"due to distance (500+ miles round trip). Only our second visit in 5 years.
