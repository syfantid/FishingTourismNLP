Ever felt at home on a boat?,"When not taking you on a trip around the island with his daughter Ntina, Kyriakos is a fisherman.

This trip is the perfect mix between a touristic hop between the unaccessible beaches of Mílos, the experiencing or Paragadi fishing, and the tasting of traditional fish soup (fresher fish, you die! You’ve just taken it out of the water!)

Avoid the big boats. You’ll just spend the day with 30 to 50 other tourists. Let Kyriakos and Ntina share a bit of their daily lives.

These guys are a bit hard to find, so look for them in the port of Adamantas! The boat is called Anna Maria (Kyriako’s granddaughter).",Date of experience: August 2019,Milos Fishing Trip,1,"Milos, Greece"
"They overbooked, so they kicked me out after two days! :)","Upon arrival, I was asked to pay two nights ahead. When I went to pay the rest, I was informed that there were no more rooms available for the nights I had booked :D

Otherwise, you get what you expect when paying a room less than 20 USD. Small room (we called it 'the prison cell' with my friend), noisy corridors (no details ;) ), dripping noises, no hot water in my shower, crappy wifi, insufficient breakfast (but don't forget to go get your daily vouchers as they have not yet discovered the breakfast list( a staff that genuinly does not care.",Date of stay: August 2018,Zirka,1,"Odessa, Ukraine"
Easygoing café,"A bit outside of the center, but cool place with funky decoration. Local beers and friendly staff. No english spoken, but understanding people willing to communicate in approximate terms",Date of visit: August 2018,Unit Men`s Life CAFE,1,"Odessa, Ukraine"
"A room with a view, top quality services, and ommelet not included in your breakfast","This property is awesome! I'm a fan of the Radisson service concept and enjoy my stay at this impressive, modern hotel every time. My only dis<apointment this time around is around the breakfast. While omelets used to be included in what one could order, this time aroumd an 8 euro charge was requested.",Date of stay: June 2018,"Radisson Blu Hotel, Nice",1,"Nice, France"
