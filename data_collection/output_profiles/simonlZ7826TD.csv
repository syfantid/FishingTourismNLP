Unforgettable day with the nicest hosts!,"My girlfriend and I went on the fishing trip with Tina and her father and it was the most wonderful day of our vacation. We went along the south shore of Milos and the views were breathtaking. We did snorkling in otherwise unaccessible locations, we fished the coast and we stopped in Kleftiko to have lunch with expertly cooked, freshly caught fish. Tina and her father are great cooks, the food was unbelievable. Please, do not skip on this incredible, almost private experience. I will never forget it!",Date of experience: August 2019,Milos Fishing Trip,5,"Milos, Greece"
