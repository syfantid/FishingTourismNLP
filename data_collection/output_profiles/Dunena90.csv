"Fishing, swimming and 1st class hospitality","This is a must do day out when at this beautiful Greek island. With a maximum of 12 persons allowed a trip you get 5* treatment with plenty of room.

We meet the crew first thing. Set sail and cast out the nets. They cruised around the beautiful coast to private bay for a swim and short break. We then returned to bring the nets in for our lunch .

Went for a another swim whilst our large feast was prepared. Fresh fish, fresh spaghetti with squid, fresh salad with organic vegetables grew in the captains own garden. To top it of we had wine also made by the captain.

Highly recommend",Date of experience: September 2018,Zante Fishing Tours,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
