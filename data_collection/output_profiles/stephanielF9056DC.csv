Exceptional Fishing/Boating Experience - highly recommended,"We had an incredibly amazing time on the fishing trip that was arranged and recommended by our hotel. The family was so generous and sweet. We had the best lunch and were entertained all day long. The swimming, fishing and boating were the very best. Most of all - they treated us like family. We highly recommend this adventure. We had a magnificent time.

Incredibly Beautiful Hotel - Best on Island,"The hotel was amazingly beautiful and the hotel staff were so helpful and kind. They gave us many suggestions of places to visit. We had the best honeymoon. The rooms were pristine and the grounds were incredible. The pool was also super clean and fun to visit every day. We visited the spa and had a massage - AWESOME

We could not have asked for a better paradise for our honeymoon. We highly recommend this hotel and definitely will stay again.
