A must do trip,"First of all, the Captain, Giorgios, is one of the most friendly person I've met. When we arrived, he offered us coffee and biscuits made by his mother-in-law, who does the cooking in the shop. He will also talk to you like you are one of his best friend and it makes the experience very special and intimate. The ship is extremely clean and it's easy of access. It has a toilet, a couple of benches and you can also go in the front next to the Captain's cabin to sunbathe. The experience is a thing you have to live if you go to zakynthos. Giorgios will explain the process of fishing with nets, the type of fish you will catch and tell you fishing stories. The two places we go swimming are incredible. You will see fishes if you have water goggles and the water is very clear and warm. Finally, you will eat a very good dinner,made by the Captain's mother-in-law, composed of the fishes you caught and many other things.",Date of experience: June 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
