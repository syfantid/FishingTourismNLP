Brilliant trip!,"Amazing day! Friendly, knowledgable hosts who were infinitely patient with small children and curious adults alike. Genuine experience of the Greek way of fishing, with the added bonus of eating the catch. All the food was exceptional - from the cake, to the lobster, the fish and the spaghetti. Plenty of time to laze around the boat, swim, and explore quiet beaches. Would recommend this as the best day out, and definitely the best place to eat in Kefalonia. Bravo Antonia!!!!",Date of experience: September 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
