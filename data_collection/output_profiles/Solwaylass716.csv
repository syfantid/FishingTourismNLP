Really dissaponted,"I thought the aircraft and service would be similar to Emirates as I have flown with them many times, but had to fly Etihad to Greece. I realise long haul flights in economy are no picnic but was really disappointed in the poor service and really ordinary food on this flight.
It is also the first time that after purchasing my flight ticket I had to purchase a reservation so my partner and I could sit together for this 17 hour flight. It's my last trip with Etihad.",Date of travel: August 2018,Etihad Airways,1,World
Very special evening,"Was given this voucher by my dad and sister to try Polperro winery. We booked for dinner. Not disappointed, fabulous setting, small restaurant with personal service, the food left me speechless. Beautiful wines. Hoping they get me another voucher this year too. Can't wait to go back.",Date of experience: August 2018,Polperro Winery,1,"Red Hill, Australia"
Heavenly day,"This would be special anyway but Dimitrios and Effie make it unforgettable. Fabulous day out on the water from Ketelios, which is a beautiful village on the water. Snorkelling, fishing, clay baths and an amazing lunch. You cannot miss this if you are in Kefalonia.",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great location,"Great location, fantastic pub across the road called Ministry of Music if you like that sort of thing. I did. Staff were a bit generally unhappy and not that friendly. I can understand working in that heat. Parking was a total nightmare. There were a few places reserved out the front for hotel guests but you had to get out and move the metal barrier, then hotel staff would come running out and move you somewhere else with no explanation. Breakfast was okay. Rooms were clean and quiet. Pool was a blessed relief.",Date of stay: August 2018,Menelaion Hotel,1,"Sparta, Greece"
Lovely people and nice view,"Lacked a bit of something, food was average. Wine was poured from a very large plastic container. Wasn't a fan.",Date of visit: August 2018,Stamna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great family run restaurant,"Hey Mikeys, thanks for all the great nights we spent in your tavern. The best dolmades you will ever taste. Fabulous place, great atmosphere, friendly staff, food is amazing. But Mickeys you do not make cosmopolitans out of Lemons!!
I will come back one day and bring some for you. Paul and Lesley Bradley",Date of visit: August 2018,Denis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Poor,I took my dad and sister there for a drink and it looked like we 'interrupted' the bar staff from her chat and said 'what do you want'. I felt like we were intruding. Didn't stay to try the food.,Date of visit: January 2017,Kings Creek Hotel,1,"Hastings, Australia"
Nice work,"Had a really nice time there with the family, lady in charge bent over backwards to make sure we had everything we needed. Am a regular in the bistro but the restaurant food is really great.",Date of visit: February 2017,Marina Restaurant & Bar Bistro,1,"Hastings, Australia"
Appalling,Wouldn't let me friend and I sit together whilst drinking coffee because we were taking up too much room. Practically threw the coffee at us. What a shame.,Date of visit: February 2017,Beach cafe,1,"Seaford, Australia"
Just coffee with a friend,The waitress didn't want my friend and I to sit together on the bench seat as we were taking up too much room (restaurant half empty) and practically threw the coffee at us. (served on the other side of the table). The staff were hostile to say the least.,Date of visit: February 2017,Crackerjack Beachfront,1,"Seaford, Australia"
Customer Service,"Have have coffee & take aways from there before. Younger staff could do with some customer service training. Waited 10 minutes for service without even a ""sorry wont be a minute."" To add insult to injury three people walked in together after this time and The younger girl went to take their order straight away. Very disappointing!.",Date of visit: July 2016,Cafe Euro,1,"Somerville, Australia"
Appauling,"I was there yesterday and was upset to find me and my friend could not sit side by side on the bench seat to chat to each other.

Nice coffee, nasty staff.",Date of visit: September 2015,Beach cafe,1,"Seaford, Australia"

Magic Reef Bungalows - pure magic,"We arrived in the middle of the night to be greeting with fresh flower lays and a smiling driver. When sun rose the next day we realised we were in a magic place. Our beachfront bungalow was spotless, private and surounded by beautiful palm trees.
Angela is your host here, she just cannot do enough for you. There are two restaurants 5 minutes walk along the beach, and of course being on the west side of the island you are blessed by a beautiful sunset each evening.
I would highly recommend staying at Magic Reef and after checking out other accomodation on the island realised that I had picked the best. Can't wait to go back.",Date of stay: March 2014,Magic Reef Bungalows,1,"Rarotonga, Cook Islands"

Friendly staff,"But happy hour left us paying $38 for a couple of cocktails cosmopolitan and a mai tai, didnt think there was all that much happiness there.
The menu changes every night, mexican, pizza, seafood etc, so the night we went to eat we could only get seafood which I had eaten 5 nights in a row so had to leave to find something else. Lovely setting.",Date of experience: March 2014,Wilson's Beach Bar - Castaway Resort Rarotonga,1,"Rarotonga, Cook Islands"
rockys beach resort,"We had a bungalow right on the beach, it was clean, tastefully decorated and well appointed, we couldnt have asked for anything more.
Staff were friendly and helpful, rooms were kept clean, absolutely no complaints.
The restaurant had really nice food and we watched a couple of shows there, it is more expensive than travelling to Lamai beach for food, but is delicious.
I would love to go back to Rockys Beach Resort and would recommend it to anyone.",Date of stay: September 2012,Rocky's Boutique Resort,1,"Lamai Beach, Thailand"
