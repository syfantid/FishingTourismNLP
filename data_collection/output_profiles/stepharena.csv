A must-do experience!,"A huge thank you to Antonia, Michelis & crew for a wonderful experience last night! My husband and I were on the 'sunset' trip which commenced at 5pm.

Antonia was quick to respond to my enquiry (which was very last minute) and gave us all the necessary information promptly.

Shortly after departing on the boat, we were treated to delicious cake. We then watched the crew pull in the nets - it was so interesting to see the whole process and watch how it's done! We then stopped for a swim stop in the most beautiful spot. Antonia made us a beautiful appetizer whilst we waited for dinner. Dinner consisted of a FULL table of deliciousness - fish soup, salads, pasta with octopus, prawns and lobsters! After dinner, we had the sweetest watermelon.

The crew were all extremelly welcoming & friendly. Antonia also went out of her way to ensure we got back to our hotel safely at the end of the night.

We highly recommend this experience!! It's a little different, fun & the food is amazing!

Thanks again!!
