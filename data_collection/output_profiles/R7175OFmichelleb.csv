Fish at its best,"So refreshing to find somewhere that knows it’s fish !
Octopus starter, sprats and langoustine all perfectly cooked and fresh.
Mains . Hake, Frito misto and plaice delicious.
Fantastic puddings too..
Only thing I would say I would like to drink my wine out of a nicer glass, but that’s the only criticism.
Will be back and certainly recommend to everyone ..",Date of visit: October 2020,Sobo Fish,1,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom"

Memorable Day,"We live in Bournemouth and my husband is a keen fisherman so when we found this trip on the internet and read the reviews we knew we had to book it.Wow we weren’t disappointed.. from the minute we stepped foot on Efi & Dimitris boat we felt so welcome .. coffee and cakes and a spotlessly clean deck .. plentiful fish from the nets that had been put out the evening before and you had a chance to help with the catch ! Octopus,A flying fish ! Parrot fish,Red mullet (sweet to eat!) bream to name but a few .. homemade lemonade to die for .. off to several beaches where you can swim and then later a clay beach to cover yourself in cold clay (looking like a tribe from Pirates of The Caribbean ) but for me the highlight of the day was the lunch that follows the catch .. Efi is a superb host and can cook ! The lunch was some of the best tasting fish I have ever had and we eat a lot of fresh fish in our house .. drizzled with olive oil lemon and oregano fresh from the griddle ..warm potato salad fresh bread it’s worth going just for the lunch alone.. homemade wine and watermelon from the garden when sat in one of most beautiful parts of the world I’ve ever been to . The Ionian islands are stunningly beautiful.
Truly such an amazing day from 8-3pm it’s such a good value day for all my family who loved every minute and we have already said we are going back to Kefalonia next year and will book to go back to see Efi & Dimitrios again.Everything was perfect ..
If you are off to Kefalonia please please book this day out .. you will not be disappointed.
Such fabulous hosts.
Efi such a great passionate cook...

Take away,"Having been a really good regular customer for many years I can’t tell you disappointed I am that we’ve had a really average meal this evening .. honestly we have a curry maybe once a week as always so good.. however we’ve had a few not so good meals and its not a cheap curry by no means.This evening our food cost £40 and was watery.. chicken tikka too hot to eat and korma like a soup
Called the owner and he offered another meal after we had eaten
What he should have done was offered another meal another day for free the amount of money we spend.You have to look after your regular customers Anguish.. very disappointed in your reaction this evening",Date of visit: November 2018,Naan,1,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom"
Greek Treasure,"Traditional Greek family restaurant in a very pretty side street away from the tacky side of Old Town Rhodes.We had an amazing home cooked meal..Lamb chops.Mussels,Grilled Octopus,Greek Salad home made pitta bread to die for!
You have to try if in the Old Town",Date of visit: August 2018,Kathopoulis Family Restaurant,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Easter hols,"Great( if a little expensive per person) way to see the sights around London and exciting when you plunge into the River Thames right next to MI6! I think our tour guide made our trip as he was very English and had an eccentric sense of humour perfect for the occasion.
Would recommend this experience.",Date of experience: April 2017,London Duck Tours,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Easter hols,"We arrived here quite late after a longish journey up from Bournemouth Sunday evening.They were happy to seat our table of five,it's a beautiful building,gorgeous spiral staircase in the middle of the building.
The waitresses looked after us wonderfully,friendly and attentive throughout and the food was very good.Mussels were especially nice and the Malaysian curry also very good.",Date of visit: April 2017,The Mute Swan,1,"East Molesey, United Kingdom"
Easter break,Excellent hidden gem opposite station and the food was very very good.Nice service and atmosphere very intimate little place.,Date of visit: April 2017,Plenty,1,"Hampton, United Kingdom"
Average Italian,"Another average Italian,no better than I can cook at home which is the norm for most Italian restaurants in Bournemouth.",Date of visit: January 2017,Bellaggio,1,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom"
A hidden treasure in Winton,"Visited firstly with friends for birthday lunch and have to say I don't usually review BUT,the coffee was superb (double expresso with hot milk as requested) the sandwiches we all had were wonderful,bread not too thick and fabulous choice of fillings thinking outside the normal
Cheese,Ham,Tuna but all with a twist and tasty,well presented with a lovely fresh crisp coleslaw (homemade) on the side.
The staff were,are friendly on the ball with the right service,eager to please which I like when going out to eat however small it may be I believe this is how it should be done.For me though? The Cakes!!
Just to die and go to heaven for ,seriously great great cake.
I bake/love to cook/eat!! at home and so to find this place is amazing they really have got it right here and it's so refreshing to find,there are so many bad places to eat in Bournemouth.I'm hooked literally.
They even have the music right!
Pop in it won't disappoint.
Dentist went ok btw....",Date of visit: January 2017,Wistmans,1,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom"
Meal,"Fabulous waitress from Lisbon!
Great pizza and lasagne the best I've tasted outside Italy!
Keep up the good work,really accommodating excellent",Date of visit: August 2016,Pizzamobile,1,"Salema, Portugal"
Dinner disaster,"Booked a table here after morning coffee as location was to die for opposite beach! Arrived and after waiting at least ten minutes for a drink we ordered our meal and when asked if the main course came with vegetables and potatoes not chips we were told yes of course veg and potatoes.
The sardines came on a plate with three boiled potatoes and no veg.At no point after our meal was served were we asked if all ok? Would u like oil/vinegar for salad not a thing until we had all finished and then after waiting another half an hour for our meals to be cleared we asked for the bill.There was not enough waiters to tend to the busy restaurant and the food was bland and very disappointing.The problem is they think as the location is so sought after they can give you bad service and average food well your wrong and I hope you get your act together and the tourist stop coming as it was an awful meal/experience.",Date of visit: August 2016,Boia Bar,1,"Salema, Portugal"
Fabulous food location people,"Fab food people and location
Best pizza and fish and the puddings all homemade the Panna cotta to die for!!
Staff attentive service was great and the spaghetti vongole superb",Date of visit: August 2016,Casa Pizza Restaurante Pizzaria,1,"Salema, Portugal"
Weeks bliss,"Found on Expedia and so glad we did!
The two bedroom town house was simply first class accommodation with sea views like no other,pay a little extra as it's so worth waking to the view daily.The beds are wonderful alongside the pillows and the jacuzzi bath also an added luxury.Pool exceptionally clean and cleaners come daily.No need to take any towels on holiday they supply beach/pool and shower/bath inside townhouses.Ten mins down a steep hill into Salema where the best supermarket is opposite La Boia (Romeo the owner simply the best and can't do enough for you) he even lent us some chairs to take to beach!! If you purchase your groceries from him he delivers free of charge back to Salema Beach village and he can take two passengers with him so well worth using him for all your supplies as he can deliver it all up the steep hill!! If you want the option of cooking and the kitchens have everything you need to do so.
Last day tomorrow room 030 and we will be sad to leave this magical town,attentive staff in pool bar and the food is very good here also!.
Will return next year !!",Date of stay: August 2016,Salema Beach Village,1,"Salema, Portugal"
