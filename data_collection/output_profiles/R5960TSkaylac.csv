Business owner is a wonderful woman!,"My mother and I came to Florida to enjoy the beach, but Deerfield closed all the beaches the morning of our visit due to the Corona virus. We decided to cancel our beach stay. Although we felt bad to cancel business at such a crucial time for small businesses, the owner, Debbie, was so understanding and personally gave us a full refund. She could have charged us for the one night since the credit card had already been charged, but she decided to manually refund the charge and let us cancel without any problems. The hotel looked beautiful, with a modern curb appeal and clean pool, as well as a mini golf area, with plenty of beach chairs to lay down and enjoy the sun. We hope to visit again very soon when the beaches are safe! Thank you so much for your hospitality and character!",Date of stay: March 2020,Ocean Villas Of Deerfield,4,"Deerfield Beach, Florida"
A++++++++ staff and experience!,"My family and I had an absolutely incredible time on this experience. We got to see the beautiful rugged Santorini coast and three different colored beaches- black (I learned from volcanic ash), red (from iron), and white (from marble), while the experienced staff explained to us all about Santorini's history, coastline, and fishing. We pulled up nets of shrimp and the staff cooked them for us on the spot- so delicious! Then we pulled up nets of fish and caught fish, too, while they grilled and fried them and we ate them right on the boat. The food was amazing and it was so helpful and special to hear from the staff their personal stories and experiences of the island. We got to jump in the water, which was chilly and refreshing but not freezing, see the sunset, and spend time together not only as a family but meeting the awesome other 7-8 people on our boat. 10-12 people per boat is a perfect number for a cozy group. Thank you for sharing with us your knowledge and making me see why Santorini is such a wonderful place!",Date of experience: June 2019,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Beautiful views,"The most gorgeous views I saw in all of our travels in Greece! Perfect location! The wine is just okay. I usually like red wine, but they were not very good- the whites were a little better. However, the atmosphere and views made it a top highlight of our trip!",Date of experience: June 2019,Santo Winery,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Delicious food and friendly service,"This place is a quiet, authentic, homey taste of Greece. The food was incredible with delicious red wines, lamb in a pot, and fresh salad, and the staff even brought us out fruits and desserts for free. It was a very inexpensive place as well! A must try in Heraklion!",Date of visit: June 2019,Merastri,4,"Crete, Greece"
Best staff and beautiful hotel!,"My family and I had an incredible time in Santorini thanks to the kind and helpful staff at Studios Marios hotel. They helped recommend us the best spots, get us whatever we needed, and provided friendly and fun company. The hotel rooms were beautiful and spacious with pretty balconies, and the pool was a great place to get drinks, enjoy the sunshine, and relax in a beautiful, quiet spot. Thank you for making Santorini our favorite spot to visit! :) -Kayla",Date of stay: June 2019,Studios Marios,4,"Santorini, Greece"
