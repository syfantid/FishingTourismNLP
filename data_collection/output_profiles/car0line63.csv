Out of this world,"I can’t distinguish a favourite part of this experience, just that it was unforgettable and I will remember it forever. I will always remember Giorgos staying by my side as we swam to shore, I am terrified when I am out of my depth but I did it ! Learning how the whole process works to catching the fish, reeling it in and eating it was just so unique an experience, so out of the ordinary. I would recommend doing this to anyone, well worth the money and the hosts are fabulous and friendly . Hope one day to do it again!!",Date of experience: September 2020,Zante Fishing Tours,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Zante fishing tours,"This was one of the highlights of my holiday. It was such a unique experience I will never forget. My friend and I had sole attention of the crew who are a family run enterprise. We started out at sunrise and after a while helped to let down the nets,leaving them for a few hours we swam to Porto Roma for a drink and stroll on the beach. When it was time we hauled in the catch and sat down to eat the lovely feast cooked by Giorgios mother in law. Very happy memories to take home,I highly recommend to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary, thank you ️",Date of experience: August 2018,Zante Fishing Tours,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Hotel Christina.......very friendly aand welcoming,we stayed here at the beginning of June for a week. Christina and her staff were very friendly and helpful. great if you have kids as the waterpark is across the road.It is not very far from the centre of Tsilivi but with plenty of bars and restaurants on your way in. the beach is about a ten minute relaxed walk.the hotel itself does a good bbq twice a week aswell as breakfast and snacks/meals. the accomodation is basic but all you need and very clean. my partner and i are looking forward to returning in September. thankyou for a great stay Christina and co x,Date of stay: June 2015,Christina Apartments,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
great authentic greek food with a great view of the sea . extremely welcoming staff. my favourite place to eat in Tsiliv,"I liked everything!!!!!!!!goood greek foood at its best. the locals love it so it must be good. have lovely memories of drinking the local vino and having a great view of the beach and looking over to the Island of Kefalonia. some great unusual dishes that you would not find in the town like fresh marinated anchovies, stuffed cuttlefish and the greek potato salad was a nice change from the norm. the moussaka and pistaccio? was also delicious.",Date of visit: June 2015,Taverna Paradeisos,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
too busy,"the reputation is so good this restaurant is too busy, we had a wait of over30 mins and felt we were rushed so that the table could be used again,not my idea of a leisurely meal.I have to say I thought the food was good but my husband didn't. I had kleftiko which was good enough but the fast pace just spoiled it. The staff didn't get a chance to chat and be sociable which is a shame. Perhaps the owners should plough some profit into opening a sister restaurant.I still rate the premier as better and the Taverna Paradiso on Tsilivi beach which do really good greek food at reasonable prices.",Date of visit: September 2011,The Olive Tree Taverna,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
good food good service friendly staff,"every meal we had here was excellent from the kleftiko and the stifado to the crab balls. also the free little plates of a taste of Zante with your meal are good. I asked one day if I could have the kleftiko made with kid (the way the greeks like it and less fatty than Lamb)they obliged me by doing it for the next evening and it was good. The place is afamily run business and they are very friendly.We used this place at least half of our two week stay as it was near The Daisy apts andThe Zante star and The Lesante and because we didn't need to walk that bit further for a less enjoyable experience,overall top marks for well presented greek food.",Date of visit: September 2011,Premier Restaurant,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
exquiste,"stayed here for 1 night on 8th of January.It has just been taken over so older reviews do not apply. I had a first rate meal, squid starter with a delicious chorizo salad with a pomegranate cassis dressing, roast beef main course,Ihave never tasted beef like it it melted in my mouth. My daughter had a dessert of chocolate brownie with caramelised white chocolate ice cream and hazel nuts which tasted divine, she also had goats cheese starter and chicken pasta main she said she would of gladly just had the pasta and its sauce it was so good. We had a lovely Irish breakfast with locally sourced ingredients. If I ever get the chance to go back to Bangor Iwouldn't hesitate to book in a The Salty Dog-ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS. The prices were cheap in comparison to the excellence of the food.Well done Derek!!!",Date of visit: January 2012,The Salty Dog Hotel and Bistro,4,"Bangor, United Kingdom"
