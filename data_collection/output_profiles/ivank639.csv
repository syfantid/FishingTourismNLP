Wonderful afternoon spent on the boat,"We had awesome afternoon with Mario, definitely one of the highlights of our Korcula vacation!
He showed us two really nice snorkeling spots, took us to island Badija, pretty known couse of famous monastery, local deers (bring some food for them) :-).
Mario told us about his hometown Lumbarda, island of Korcula and Korcula history. It was a perfect mixture of getting to know island and korcula archipelago, history from local person, swim and snorkel or just a fact of going somewhere you wouldn’t be able to reach without a boat.
The grilled sea bass with fresh salad, served together with his own homemade wine was really delicious. I do not have enough words to express my satisfaction with Mario and this trip. Really highly recommended!
Thnx Mario and best regards from Petra and Ivan!",Date of experience: August 2020,Fish & Fun - Korcula,3,"Korcula Island, Croatia"
"Great dinner, great service!","We took a dinner starting with cold starter from my side (salmon and tuna tartar), steamed mussels from girlfriend’s side. Both starters were delicious.
Then we continued with swordfish steak and squid stuffed with cheese and tomato. There’s no word to describe enough how this was delicious.
We finished with “baklava” and chocolate suffle, both served with vanilla ice cream.
Highly reccomended, house red wine.
Surely we’ll return once again.",Date of visit: August 2019,Avocado,3,"Rhodes, Greece"

Not more than average!,"We visited this restaurant after seeing good reviews for it, but were dissapointed at the end. We ordered mojito and glass of red wine and bruschette for the starter. Pomidoro bruschette was really good, but drinks, uff.. Glass of red wine was served totally cold which such restaurant should know how to serve it and on which temperature, cocktail was nothing special.
My girlfriend took pizza which was ok and i took pasta with mussels. I could barely count 5 mussels in the plate which was full of spaghetti and pomidoro sauce, in one moment i tought i ordered pomidoro soup.

Overall, i would not recommend this restaurant, and for sure we won’t return.",Date of visit: August 2019,Ιl Borgo,3,"Rhodes, Greece"
