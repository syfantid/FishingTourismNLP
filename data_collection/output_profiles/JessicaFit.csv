Good but nothing special,"Visited on a quiet Thursday morning for breakfast. Service was very good as both waitresses were very friendly and helpful.
The food was good. Nothing out of this world, but good.
The breakfast bagel was nicely served with tasty crispy bacon, poached egg and avocado. The Chocolate bowl was quite nice also with a good balance of Chocolate, peanut butter, granola and banana. Chocolate brownie was also good
Some key points: We had to bring it to the staff's attention that the breakfast bagel was missing the crispy onion. Also, the Chocolate bowl was supposed to have coconut shavings in it which it didn't. So I'd expect the food served to include all ingredients mentioned on the menu. Second, rhe food took quite a long time to be served which I'd read also on previous comments by other clients.
Price was fair. Quantify is satisfactory.",Date of visit: November 2020,Java,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Ticks all the right boxes,"Visited with my boyfriend for dinner. We entered into a beautiful restaurant with a romantic atmosphere. The service was very good, even though it is worth mentioning the restaurant was almost empty.
Food was excellent. My boyfriend took curry risotto which was abundant and tasty and I took pizza Chef's special with a cheesy crust. It was delicious: smoked duck breast, walnuts, honey and raisins. Divine combination. We were given complimentary homemade cherry wine at the end which was also exquisite.
Price was very fair at 35 euro total for two dishes and four drinks.
Will visit again for sure!",Date of visit: November 2020,Ta' Stringi,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Very good products!,"Stumbled upon this cafeteria by chance. The multiple blocks of chocolate on display were gorgeous and appetizing. Opted for a 50g slab of milk chocolate honeycomb and a minni chocolate dessert with passionfruit. The chocolate was divine. The latte was also interesting and unique. Needless to say, presentation was top notch and ambiance was quaint. Only reason why I don't give it full marks is the price. 100g chocolate for 7 euro is a bit hefty. However, it is worth a try for chocolate enthusiasts!",Date of visit: November 2020,Sunday in Scotland,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Did not enjoy the meal,"The ribs were cold and lacked much BBq flavour. Fries were very good. Pricey for quality. Service was fine and ambiance was nice. That being said, my friend enjoyed her Local Burger.",Date of visit: November 2020,StrEat Whisky Bistro,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Good food,"Food and ambiance are both pleasant, even though nothing special. Pulled pork ftira was nice and different, with a strong mustard taste. My boyfriend enjoyed the Asian noodles, but he claimed they had too much ginger. The apple pancakes were good, but toffee was not enjoyable. The batter and apples were delicious.
I do recommend the cannoli milkshake which was divine! Honestly one of the best milkshakes I've ever had!
Quite pricey. Not sure if I'd revisit",Date of visit: November 2020,Villager By Munchies,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Spectacular throughout!,"This restaurant is located as a part of a hotel in the main road of Mellieha. The interior is very nicely decorated and waitresses were extremely friendly and diligent.
Ordered Pappardelle e Manzo for starter,which was delicious: cooked in a mushroom wine sauce and boasting with beef fillet and sundried tomatoes.
For main course, I opted for the Truffle burger which was accompanied with sweet potato fries and a delicious bourbon-like sauce. The patty was very flavorful and truffle sauce exquisite
Finally, one of the highlights, the divine mini doughnuts, smothered in warm Nutella and pistachios. The doughnuts were soft and coated with cinnamon and were sublime!
Value is also great, for a three course meal with a large coke the price was 30 euro.
Highly recommended!",Date of visit: October 2020,Tosca Restaurant,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Exceeded expectations!,"Ordered delivery from Bianca's which arrived hot and looking great
Ordered chicken burger, mac and cheese and Chocolate Chip shake
The burger was simply amazing, chicken was juicy and breading was super tasty. Chips were also exquisite
Mac and cheese was mouthwatering! Oozing with strong cheese taste so if you are a cheese lover, this is a must!
Milkshake was also very good
Price is very fair and portions large. Highly recommended! Will order more soon!",Date of visit: October 2020,Bianca's,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Great coffee and sweets!,This Italian Cafe surely excels when it comes to coffee and sweets. I highly recommend their Pistachio Crostata and Fresh Doughnut filled with nutella on order. Simply divine! Very friendly staff and great espresso too!,Date of visit: October 2020,UC Caf√®,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Delicious food and great atmosphere!,"We visited Planet Hollywood Malta for the first time last Saturday for dinner. Having been to the one at Disneyland Paris several times, we had high expectations.
The decor is just as fabulous, with memorabilia of famous movies and actors. The restaurant in Malta is not quite as big, and the merchandise store is a bit dull. But otherwise, well decorated.
We chose a table outside overlooking the shopping mall.
We tried The Pink Panther mocktail which was very nice. We then ordered a Pulled Pork Burger and BBQ Pork Ribs. Both were delicious. The ribs were very tender and the sauce was amazing. Fries were thick and pleasant also. Portions were huge. For dessert, we ordered ice cream and the double chocolate Brownie. These were also wonderful, as was the chocolate milkshake.
We were also very well served by Tatiana who made sure our night was wonderful. Price is on the expensive side, but the quantity and quality make up for it for sure!
Highly recommended1!",Date of visit: October 2020,Planet Hollywood Malta,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Great food ar great prices!,"We visited for Saturday lunch. Ambiance is very welcoming and staff was friendly.
We opted for the mixed doner in plate which came with a generous serving of chicken and lamb, 6 salads of our choice, pita bread, fries and sauces. The serving was huge! Meat was delicious and I particularly enjoyed the rice, couscous, mushrooms and potato salad. Fries were thin and crispy also. all this food for just 9.50!
Highly recommended!",Date of visit: October 2020,Posh Turkish,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Would give it more stars if I could!!!,"Visited for the first time on my boyfriend's birthday. We were seated inside due to weather conditions. The interior is quaint and nicely decorated. Simple, but great attention is paid to detail; the couches are very comfortable and decorated with embroidered cushions, walls are characteristic of old Maltese stone.
Service was impeccable. We were attended to very well. The chef also came out to speak to us and described how all the food is made in-house. In fact, the warm bread rolls served in the beginning were amazing and tasted homemade for sure.
The starters were delicious: Pork Cheek Croquette for my boyfriend and Parmesan Agnolotti for myself. Both were exquisite, the Agnolotti were filled with delicious Parmesan cheese and topped with fresh truffles, a sweet onion sauce and Parmesan chips.
Main courses were definitely the highlight of the night. My boyfriend opted for the grilled Rib Eye while I took the Braised Belly of Local Pork. The Pork Belly dish was unbelievable! One of the best dishes I've ever had in my life! The pork was soft, juicy and tender to the touch. It's flavour was unbeatable. It was served with a canneloni filled with Maltese sausage. This was also phenomenonal. We both took a side portion of Truffled Polenta Chips which were incredibly tasty too!
Dessert was also a hit. I opted for the oozing hot Hot Chocolate Fondant served with vanilla ice cream and topped with hazelnut brittle. Simply wow!
Price with drinks was 107 euro. I can tell you it was worth every single penny! A shout out to chef Ryan Vella and waitress Ariana. Excellent experience and easily one of the best restaurants in Malta!",Date of visit: October 2020,Commando Restaurant,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Perfect Pizza and wonderful service!,"We visited on a Tuesday evening after being curious as to how good the pizzas are at this famous restaurant chain.
The location of the Qawra restaurant is beautiful. We sat on the terrace overlooking the beautiful coastline. We were served by a very diligent and helpful young man who made sure our experience was a great one.
We ordered several pizzas. I ordered the famous Calzone Capo di Monte and I also tried the Pizza Funghi Bianca. The Calzone was huge and had a delicious filling of truffle, cheese and mushroom and topped with a generous amount of parmesan, rucola and parma ham. The olive oil was also a nice touch. The pizza Funghi Bianca was also divine. It tasted like a Carbonara dish with a strong garlic flavour. Pizza dough was also very good.
For dessert we ordered the Pizzotto dei Peccatori which is a small calzone filled with nutella and topped with crushed nuts and chocolate sauce. This was to die for! The portion was perfect and it was generously filled with oozing warm Nutella. The dough complemented the sweetness of the dessert.
Lastly, I'd like to mention their amazing and unique drinks. I was particularly impressed by their Ice flavoured hot chocolate which was basically hot chocolate with ice. This was incredible. Their cappuccino with cinnamon flavour was also a hit.
Price is fair for quality and quantity. Highly recommended and will definitely be back!",Date of visit: September 2020,Vecchia Napoli,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Unique and Super Delicious!,"Ordered an Octopus Burger for take away. I was surprised by how good this was. The octopus was so soft and delicious. The chorizo complemented the octopus very well, as did the excellent tomato relish. The bread was fresh and crispy. The burger came with a large portion of amazing salty fries. Highly recommended! Very unique and worth every penny!",Date of visit: September 2020,Sea Salt Gourmet Takeaway,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Great pastries!,Ordered a Pistachio and Nutella Croissant to go. They were huge at only 1.80 a piece. The Pistachio one was ok but the Nutella one was TO DIE FOR! Heavily filled and very soft dough. Will try other pastries for sure!,Date of visit: September 2020,Le 2 Sicilie,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Definitely a new favourite!,"Visited this restaurants after seeing the menu online. I was intrigued by their unique burgers. The restaurant is tucked away behind Naxxar Parish Church and the interior, although small, is very welcoming. We were served by a lovely man (presumably the owner). I ordered a cookies flavoured ice coffee, the Indian Bhaji Burger and Waffle Fries with Cheese and Bacon. The ice coffee was one of the best I've ever had and the food...WOW! The burger was bursting with flavour, aromatic Indian spices, a fried Bhaji and excellent mango chutney. The bread was also toasted nicely. The waffle fries were also perfect. The melted nacho cheese definitely hit the spot!
Fair prices, nice ambiance and DIVINE food. Definitely a new favourite!",Date of visit: September 2020,The Daily Grub,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Delightful and genuine!,"We haveave been visiting Peking for several years and it has been the best Chinese restaurant we've ever tried. The food doesn't have excessive oil and is always fresh. Amazing dishes: from their yummy mixed starter plate and aromatic crispy duck, to their amazing chicken with cashew nuts, noodles and rice, to their divine desserts. Great service and cosy atmosphere. Not cheap, but very good if you're feeling up for Chinese!",Date of visit: September 2020,Peking,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
A very good family-run restaurant!,"Visited this restaurant on a Friday evening for dinner. The interior was cosy and quaint, much like an old Maltese townhouse. We were seated by the window, with a perfect view of the St. Paul's Bay Dock. Staff was super friendly and explained to us some of the history of the restaurant and how their family runs the place.
The menu is quite vast. We chose the curried chicken pasta as a starter and two pizzas as a main course. The pasta was delicious and pizzas were also very good. My meat feast pizza had a bolognese sauce instead of the usual tomato sauce, which was great. Pizzas were very large and we barely could eat all of them!
One critique was that the pizzas were so piping hot, that we could not eat them for a few minutes. And it was difficult to eat them by hand because toppings fell off.
However, very high quality ingredients, great dough and very good price.
I highly recommend!",Date of visit: September 2020,Damiano's,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Great apple crumble,"To be quite honest, I expected a lot better after reading multiple reviews. Ordered three small nutella and white chocolate doughnuts, a brownie cake pop, and two slices of apple crumble. the apple crumble with caramel was the best I've ever had! However, the other items were average. Total price 10 euro for small pastries which I though was a bit pricy. Very nice gentleman serving clients.",Date of visit: September 2020,Tad-Dulƒãier,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
One of the top Burger spots!,"After the hype on social media, my friends and I decided to give this eatery a try. We were welcomed by friendly staff in a cosy restaurant with chic decor. The place was very busy and most tables were reserved (lunch time)
We ordered the Pig Out Burger, Tiffany's Special Burger and Geez Louise Burger. All burgers were exquisite and perfect in taste: the beef patty was genuine, juicy and full of flavour, the pork belly and honey in the Tiffany's Special Burger was phenomenal and the extra crispy bacon in the Pig Out Burger was mouthwatering. The sweet potato fries were also a must, as was the amazing house sauce served with each burger.
We also enjoyed the Maltesers and Bounty cakes which we ordered.
Can't wait to visit again! Definitely one of the best restaurants in Malta!",Date of visit: August 2020,Tiffany's Bistro,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Amazing food and very cheap!,"This place was bustling with activity on a Sunday evening. The ambiance was fine, we were seated on the road (perhaps due to social distancing they had to include tables also on the road). Service was quite slow, for which the head waitress apologised as they were very busy and some waiters were beginners.
Other than this, we were pleasantly surprised. A complimentary board with mushroom rice, local tomato paste, beans and a basket of hot crispy Maltese bread was given. This was divine and we devoured it heartily. Then came the ribs. A huge rack of juicy tender ribs which were super easy to eat with a knife and fork as they fell right off the bone. The meat was full of flavour and BBQ sauce was excellent. Fries were very nice also. The bill for two drinks and 2 racks of ribs came to only 28 euro - what a bargain!
Great food, friendly waiters and unbeatable prices. Will be back!!!!",Date of visit: August 2020,The Fat Rabbit,1,"Island of Gozo, Malta"
Exquisite!,"Being a huge fan of ice cream, and having one of the best ice cream Parlours round around the corner, I was eager to see whether Roll & Chill is par with my favourite ice cream spots
The ""show"" where your ice cream is made in front of you is pretty fun to watch. We opted for the Kinder Bueno rolls and the Banana and Peanut Butter rolls. Both flavours were AMAZING and definitely recommended! The taste is so genuine, plus you can see with your own eyes that no artificial ingredients or sugar is added.
The staff was SUPER FRIENDLY and made the experience even more fantastic. The Kinder Bueno Bubble Waffle was delicious and huge too! Mum also opted for a watermelon lemonade which she enjoyed immensely
WELL DONE! Can't wait to visit again!",Date of visit: August 2020,Roll & Chill Ice Cream,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Good but expected better,"This quaint restaurant is found in Old Theatre Street, among the bustling activity of our beautiful capital.
Having seen reviews, especially about the carbonara, I was eager to visit
The place is very quirky: small outdoor tables, colourful decor and a lovely display of the various fresh pasta they make in-house.
For starters, we opted for the Bruschetta Norma and the Semolina Pie. The Bruschetta was good. The pie was PHENOMENAL. Bursting with truffle flavour and surrounded by the most divine Pistacchio pesto ever!
As mains we took the tagliatelle carbonara and the spinach pasta with garlic, oil and chilly. Both were good. Carbonara pasta needed a bit more creaminess as the sauce left me wanting to drink water after each bite. The guanciale was delicious. The spinach pasta was very well cooked.
Bottom line: good food and big portions at a fair price. Service was also satisfying. But there are better places for pasta.",Date of visit: August 2020,Pastaus,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Spectacular!,"Had already visited the establishment in Valletta twice. This time opted for the Mgarr restaurant. We were seated on the rooftop with a view of the Mgarr church. This was perfect! The ambiance was very beautiful and the fresh air was just what we needed in this heat!
Servers were very polite and diligent. They made sure our needs were met at all times.
We shared a few ftiras which were divine. The one with Maltese sausage and pork belly (Ta' Karmnu l-Bidija) was mouth watering! For mains I tried the Horse stew served in a whole Maltese bread. This was delicious: the red wine sauce was rich and the meat so tender and flavorful! The portion was enormous and no one managed to eat it all! I also sampled some of my Grandad's octopus stew which was to die for! The roast potatoes on the side were out of this world and everyone happily gobbled them up!
For desserts most of us had the traditional Imqaret served with Maltese ice cream. These are my far the best I've ever had. Coming from someone who doesn't like Mqaret so much, this is saying a lot! The ice cream was also divine and complimented the date fritters very well.
Price is fair for quantity and quality. I prefer this restaurant over the Valletta one just for ambiance.
Highly recommended!",Date of visit: July 2020,Nenu the Artisan Baker,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Perfect!,"A very busy cafeteria in Victoria Gozo. Delicious coffee and fresh traditional food which was divine! Great qassata, amazing pastizzi and pizza! Try the caramel latte!!",Date of visit: July 2020,Kafe' San Gorg,1,"Island of Gozo, Malta"
Good,Good but not as good as the proper chimney cake in Hungary. The dough was too crispy and not fluffy enough. Ice cream is very good and delicious toppings. Super friendly service!,Date of visit: July 2020,Funny‚Äôs Wood House,1,"Island of Gozo, Malta"
Good but expected better,"There were many things that were great, but other things that were sub par.
For starters, one dish came out cold. This was returned without issues. The service was quite poor on the whole, we were neglected most of the time and we had to make an effort to catch a waiter's attention. When we asked questions regarding price of the dessert, the reply was ""I don't know"". Cutlery was forgotten. Pasta lobster was nothing special. The sauce was good but quite average on the whole

That being said, the waiters were polite and did apologize for mistakes. Starters and desserts were divine and so were the cocktails.

Good restaurant, but expected better, considering the price",Date of visit: July 2020,Hilltop Restaurant,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
"Delicious food, unbeatable scenery!","Visited for the second time for a romantic dinner date.
We were seated outside, overlooking the gorgeous Mellieha hill, on top of which lays the beautiful Church. The manager and staff were all very welcoming and attentive.
We were served a complimentary board consisting of a fresh warm Maltese loaf accompanied by their house made tomato paste, olive oil and some salt and pepper. This went down very well
For starters we opted for the Rabbit sausage and Fried Gnocchi. The rabbit sausage lacked any distinct presence of rabbit but was enjoyed. My gnocchi were perfect - deliciously soft and flavorful, served with pumpkin veloute which was exquisite and a lot of speck - also amazing
For mains we opted for taglierini with walnut pesto and mushrooms and agnolotti with beef cheeks served in truffled butter. Both pasta dishes were excellent. The agnolotti contained very tasty juicy meat and a very salty sauce. There was not much hint of truffle however. The taglierini were delicious and also had a very good sauce.
We also had truffle parmesan chips on the side. These were very good and went well with our meal. However, yet again, a bit more truffle would have made them perfect.
This was a gorgeous experience: Excellent food, fantastic view and diligent service. Definitely will visit again!!!",Date of visit: June 2020,one80 Kitchen & Lounge,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
UNBELIEVABLE burger!,"I ordered for the first time, food came by delivery quick and hot. Ordered La Romana combo. The burger was to die for, an explosion of flavours! Burger had delicious porchetta, crispy onions and the most divine pepper sauce ever. Fries were THE BEST I've ever had by far! Super crispy! Also ordered three sauces: Jack Daniels, Peanut Butter Mayo and Hermanos sauce. The peanut butter mayo and hermanos sauces were mind blowing!!! The staff is super friendly and ready to answer any questions with enthusiasm!
Great price, exceptional food!!!!!",Date of visit: June 2020,Hermanos Burgers,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Great desserts!,"Visited after seeing all the mouthwatering dessert items on Facebook. We often go to Gozo to spend a weekend, and had not yet found a place that offers unique desserts fit for a true foodie!
Ordered a Chocolate Lover bubble waffle. It was warm, filled with chocolate and goodies like Maltesers and Kinder fingers, and topped with ice cream! Price was 6 euro, which is fair. Also, I asked for extra nutella on the side and they did not charge me for it. Nice staff, convenient location, and tasty sweets. We will be back!!",Date of visit: June 2020,Cup Cake,1,"Island of Gozo, Malta"
Good ice cream!,"Excellent ice cream, a lot of flavours to choose from. Soft serve is delicious, as are their various scoop flavours! To be honest, I was not at all impressed with the Kinder and Ferrero flavours, however I did enjoy the Helwa tat-Tork flavour. The best are by far the chocolate orange, Bounty and cannolo Siciliano flavours! Simply wow! The scoop sizes are quite small, price is ok. Recommended!",Date of visit: June 2020,Marco Tanti Gelateria,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Phenomenal!,"Definitely the best pies on the island! Can recommend the Bouchey and Pig 'n' Cheese pies, both of which contained incredibly juicy, succulent meat and amazing crust.

Perfect food!,"Ordered delivery multiple times. Pizza is the best ever, I highly recommend the Peking Duck and Quattro Stagioni ones! The crust is amazing - full of sesame seeds!

Huge portions, prompt service and great prices! Highly recommended!",Date of visit: May 2020,Rusty spoon,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
"Good pasta, wrong pizza choice?","Ordered delivery which was on time. A mistake was done to the order regarding a missing item , to which the establishment offered a free soft drink on the next order. Opted for the Oven Special Pizza with a deep pan option. The crust was beautiful, however, the pizza was not to my liking, very bitter perhaps due to the balsamic glaze. Perhaps it was the choice that was a mistake. On a more positive note, the Tickly my Fancy pasta was delicious! perfectly cooked and full of juicy chicken pieces and nice salty cream sauce.",Date of visit: May 2020,The Oven,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
On point!,"Amazing food at great prices! Delivery always on time and huge portions. One of the best pizzas I've ever had: Ample toppings, fresh ingredients and the most amazing dough with sesame seeds! Both Quattro Stagioni and Peking Duck pizzas are recommended!

"Clean, great food and excellent service","This place is a humble gem in the heart of Bugibba. Menu is so vast that it will surely suit all tastes! Opted for the Blackedout Hot Dog with sweet potato waffle fries. Portions were big and taste was superb! Fries were delicious, sauces were tasty. The sausage itself was so good and all the flavours went very well together. The pulled pork bites on top of the hot dog were awesome. My boyfriend took the honey dog which he also enjoyed thoroughly. Highly recommended! Clean and very friendly service!",Date of visit: March 2020,BlackPaw,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Pricy but exceptional!,"Visited this establishment in St. Julians for the first time for Sunday brunch. Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised by the amount of people seated, surely a good sign!
The interior is amazingly decorated and the management surely has an eye for detail; Bird cages hang from the ceiling, glasses with a particular design, armchairs instead of chairs with printed pillows. An amazing vibe overall!
Food ordered was: Porridge with berries, Strawberry and burnt marshmallow Milkshake, Beef and Ale pie, Eggs Benedict with bacon and doughnuts
The Porridge was quite filling and thick. It had an interesting texture and a nice taste. The mulkshake was large and fresh and had a very good jam taste. The pie was served in a dish with melted mash potato. The pie itself was quite small for its price (14 euro). However, it was delicious. The crust was crispy and the filling was hearty, with shredded beef, potatoes and carrots.
On to the eggs Benedict. These were beyond divine! The bread was a sweet brioche, bacon was crispy and cooked perfectly and the Hollandaise sauce was by far the best I've ever had. It was creamy and light, with a nice citrus taste. Wow!
Finally, I am not keen on doughnuts. However, the hype about Sean Gravina's doughnuts here made me too curious to pass on the opportunity to try them. Oh my Lord. These were BY FAR the best on the island... scratch that, probably the best in the world!!!! The Doughnuts themselves are tiny, but the dough is so soft, covered in sugar and filled with either kinder bueno cream, nutella or jam. I sampled one of each and all were to die for, simply perfect!
This place is surely not to be missed. These items, together with one large still water amounted to 50 euro. A hefty price, sure. And portions aren't big so for big eaters like myself, prepare to spend a lot. However, I guarantee, you will not be disappointed. WELL DONE CHEF
Will be back to try the burgers (and more doughnuts of course)",Date of visit: March 2020,Crust Bakery Bar Bistro,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Mediocre,"So this was quite a disappointing surprise. Being always full of people, and the fact that typically restaurants in Mgarr serve excellent Maltese dishes, we expected this to be a pleasant dining experience. We have dined in many Maltese establishments serving traditional cuisine and this restaurant is the worst to date. We ordered Maltese Mixed plates with rabbit, horsemeat and quail, a ribs combo platter and a whole rabbit im gravy.
The meat was lukewarm (all dishes) and was poorly seasoned. In fact, all meats had same taste and lacked flavour. Fries were delicious but very small portion served for 6 people. Service was ok. Prices, if the food was good, is fair. However, the quality of the food left us feeling like we were ripped off.
Mediocre",Date of visit: March 2020,il-Barri Restaurant,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Beyond amazing! Impeccable!,"Visited this place 3 times. The last was on my birthday. The staff went out of their way to make sure my day was a special one! Food and service were phenomenal! We took Pizza Bianca, Pizzotto, Calamari fritti, Beef Rib and churros. Everything was delicious, especially the special Churros they made for me for the occasion!
Portions huge and arguably the best pizza on the island. Despite being packed with people, the ambiance was very cosy and fun and the staff were very friendly and diligent and made sure everything was perfect. WELL DONE! One of my favourites in Malta!",Date of visit: February 2020,Cardini,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Best Cannoli and Pastries!,"This place has been round for a very long time and has acquired quite a reputation for being the best cafe/caterer in Malta.
Visited the Msida outlet which brought back many memories of when I was a child, coming in with my grandparents. We went on a Sunday exactly when it opened at 8am. In around 30 minutes the place was almost packed!
We tried various items: my boyfriend opted for the Arancini and Cannoli and a Hazelnut latte, while I took a hearty breakfast consisting of Cannoli, one pea cake, their classic hot chocolate and a few pastries (Fudgy, Caramel and Cherise).
The savouries were hot and delightful, not oily and great taste and texture. The Cannoli are by far the best we've ever had, and no doubt Busy Bee is renowned for them! The shell just breaks as it is soo fresh! The ricotta is cold and fresh and light, dusted with powdered sugar and finished with nuts. Just wow!
The pastries were divine! Fudgy (parcel-shaped) was encrusted with rich dark chocolate and hosting the most moist chocolate cake inside. Any chocaholic's dream! Cherise had a delicious milk chocolate airy mousse and a layer of berry insert which was lovely. Caramel was gooey and light, with a peanut chocolate coating which was equally as magnificent.
As for the drinks, my boyfriend was super impressed with his latte. The classic hot chocolate was served as hot milk in a glass with a home made chocolate stick on the side. This was ingenious and so delicious, one of the best hot chocolates I've had! I also tried the special Jaffa Hot Chocolate which was oozing chocolate orange goodness! Exactly like a jaffa cake.
Prices are fair for quantity and quality you get! Staff is friendly and atmosphere very relaxed. The best cafe in Malta!",Date of visit: February 2020,Busy Bee,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Perfection! One of top 5 in Malta,"We visited on a Sunday evening after seeing multiple positive reviews online. The place is quite small, located at the very beginning of Mosta (if you're coming up from Bugibba). We were greeted by a cosy ambiance with rustic decor. The staff were plentiful in numbers for such a small establishment. They were very polite and explained the menu thoroughly.
The menu here changes every week as fresh goods are imported from Italy. We opted for the degustation menu for 30 euro per person which included a four course meal.
The first was a Cheese and Cuts platter consisting of various cheeses, cold cuts, olives, figs, candied fruit, jam, croquettes, sausages etc. This was a big portion and a delightful start. The bread which was brought to the table was so fresh and soft!
The second course was spaghetti alla Gricia cooked in a parmesan wheel. The portion was to share but was very large, with fresh crispy guanciale on the side to put on the pasta. The pasta was so cheesy and delicious, the highlight of the entire meal! Wow, spectacular!
The third course was a tagliata to share, cooked medium and served with potato wedges and Himalayan salt in a small container on the side. The meat was cooked to perfection: juicy and char-grilled so you can taste the smokiness. The potatoes were salty and delicious. This was spot on!
Finally, we were given a choice of desserts and we opted for a white chocolate fondant, served with vanilla Ice cream. This was also impeccable, cooked with the perfect amount of heat to provide the right consistency. Wow!
The only minor critique is that the service was quite slow, despite there being a lot of staff. Even the bill took quite some time to arrive and we had to bring it to more than one waiter's attention. However, they were very courteous and made sure we enjoyed each course.
Bottom line: amazing food, big quantities, good service and great price! Highly recommended!",Date of visit: February 2020,Cheese & Cuts,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
That's a LEGIT burger!,"Visited as a group of 4 on a sunny Saturday for lunch. The location of the Qawra outlet is central, close to the bus terminus. The ambiance gives you a clear Impression of a fast food joint and is quite rugged looking. We had a meal consisting of nachos and Buffalo Wings as starters, then 4 Legit burgers with normal fries and extra Sweet Potato Fries on the side.
The wings were okay, nothing special. The blue cheese sauce on the side, however, was divine! So much so, that I saved it in order to dip my fries in later. The nachos were smothered in runny cheese which was nice, but underwhelming. Then came the burgers. They truly live up to their name, as they are LEGIT! The burger consisted of a juicy patty, lettuce, tomato, American style grilled cheese, crispy bacon, pickle and burger sauce which we took on the side. The burger tasted like an evolved and upgraded version of McDonald's Quarter Pounder! It was delicious and all components were exquisite when combined!

Efficient service and great pizza!,"Called on Sunday evening for pizzas to be delivered at home. The telephone operator was friendly and made sure our order was correct. The delivery arrived at the exact time we requested. We were given free garlic bread with our order
The pizzas are great, the BBQ chicken is by far our favourite. I opted for the new Philadelphia Cheesy Crust and it was to die for! A nice twist by putting cream cheese in a crust. Pizzas were fresh and warm. Garlic bread also very tasty.
Not the cheapest pizzas, but well worth it. Recommended!",Date of visit: January 2020,Domino's,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Exquisite food and amazing service!,"Being close to home and boasting beautiful views of the Xemxija bay, we decided to dine at this restaurant on a quiet Sunday evening.
The ambiance inside is very quaint: a rustic building with simple decor but nonetheless, very romantic and relaxing. The tables are spaced out adequately, giving diners their space and privacy.
The staff was excellent. They were polite and made sure our experience was fabulous throughout. Even when there was a brief power cut, they made sure we had enough candles and even gave us their mobile phone with torch on to have enough light. They were super!
As for the food, the menu is unique and boasts amazing creative dishes, from mouthwatering starters, to inviting mains of meat and fish, to an enormous pizza menu, which is cooked in their wood oven.
For starters, after the divine smell of seafood coming out of the kitchen, I opted for their risotto marina while my boyfriend opted for the Casarecce rabbit. His dish lacked enough rabbit but the sauce was very well seasoned. My risotto was perfect: cooked in a salty prawn bisque and filled with ample seafood (a king prawn, mussels and vongole). Sizes were quite large
Mains were ribs cooked in a honey BBQ sauce for my boyfriend and a pizza Tronchetto for myself. My pizza was a rolled closed shape filled with gorgonzola cheese, mozzarella and guyere cheese and covered with a truffle and honey dressing, topped with parmesan and extra crushed walnuts. This was to die for! The truffle infused with honey was a huge surprise as I'd never tried a sweet version of truffle before. The combination was sublime. Pizza crust was also delicious and sizes very good. My boyfriend's ribs were huge. The meat was tender and sauce was deliciously sweet
Price for two starters, ribs, pizza and 3 pints of coke and beer was 66 euros. Liquor was offered on the house. Very good quality food for a very fair price

Multiple visits!,"In our one week stay, my boyfriend and I visited this establishment multiple times. We tried many different drinks: Gingerbread Latte, Toffee Nut Frappuccino, Toasted Marshmallow Hot Chocolate and more. All drinks were beyond divine in flavour. Yes, not cheap at 6 euros for a medium cup, however it matches the prices in the area. Also, medium drink is very large and satisfying. The place has a relaxing vibe and the staff very helpful. Also a yummy Chocolate Starbucks coin goes well with your hot drink!",Date of visit: December 2019,Starbucks,1,"Chessy, France"
Simple good hot dogs but expensive,"The decor of this small fast food joint is on point: actual photographs of old baseball teams, memorabilia and great attention to detail. A must for any baseball fan!
Menu is limited with four hot dog choices. Price for two hot dogs, 2 cokes and one fries was a hefty 28 euros. Nonetheless, it is to be expected in Disneyland Paris. Food was good and enjoyable.

"Wow, what an excellent meal!","We visited the restaurant located in Val d'Europe shopping centre in Paris. Being meat lovers, we were keen on trying this place out.
We were welcomed by a great team of waiters who sat us at our table. We had some crunchy crisps to nibble on while we looked at the vast menu.
My boyfriend opted for the mushroom burger cooked medium while I opted for the BBQ ribs. We were pleased to find out that this place offers unlimited sides and sauces, no extra charge!!
My boyfriend's burger was so tender it melts in your mouth. My ribs were spectacular: they had an amazing smokey marinade that was finger-licking good! Both ribs and burger were not very big, but the quality cannot be faulted at all! The fries were thin and crispy and very nicely cooked. I also ordered a portion of chorizo rice which was salty and delicious. As sauces, I thoroughly enjoyed their BBQ sauce as well as their divine Roquefort cheese sauce. As a dessert, I highly recommend the profiterole. It is this giant crispy sweet pastry filled with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream, served with the most mouthwatering hot chocolate fudge sauce on the side.
Staff was very diligent and friendly throughout, ambiance is chic and modern and prices are very fair. Highly recommended!",Date of visit: December 2019,Hippopotamus,1,"Serris, France"
Overpriced and nothing special,"Visited solely for their infamous Volcano dessert. Staff was welcoming and decor is fantastic: machine-driven animals in a cool forest layout, complete with sound and lighting effects. The effects can get a bit too loud at times though.
I ordered the sparkling volcano dessert. It was huge: vertically decorated brownie pieces, in which ice cream was embedded, and covered with whipped cream and chocolate and caramel sauces
The taste was good. However, brownies were not warm. So it was basically cake and whipped cream. Way overpriced at 18 euro! Anyways, was worth a try. Visit Planet Hollywood for a better dining experience!",Date of visit: December 2019,Rainforest Caf√©,1,"Marne-la-Vallee, France"
Second time round and still spectacular!,"I had already booked this show three years ago when I visited Disney Paris with my mother. This time, I suggested to my boyfriend to book it again as I remembered how fun it was.
We arrived half an hour before the start of the show and were greeted by lovely live music by Goofy (dressed all Westernly) and some other musicians who sang some country songs. Then we were taken to our seats in a huge arena-like hall. While we were eating, a very entertaining show of comboys and Indians was going on beneath us. The staff highly encouraged the audience to participate and it was fun seeing all the stunts and action live on stage.
The food was as immaculate as I remember it! First, some nachos to nibble on. Followed by some chilli with corn bread which is delicious. Then, a skillet of a huge chicken leg, two enormous BBQ ribs, a sausage and tiny potatoes which was a very filling main course. The meat was all cooked to perfection! Sauce on point and meat tender. The dessert was out of this world! A delicious apple crumble with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream which is mouthwatering. The crumble is hot and full of mushed apples which went down nicely with the cold ice cream. This was followed by lovely coffee and a Chocolate coin. Free flowing water, coke and beer was given. The beer is excellent also.
Staff very nice and the attention to detail is phenomenal.
The cost of the show was 65 euro per person. Totally worth every penny! Highly recommended",Date of experience: December 2019,Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show with Mickey & Friends,1,"Marne-la-Vallee, France"
Good fresh food at affordable prices!,"Visited for the first ever time at Disneyland Paris. We visited once for pizza and once for pasta.
The place was jam-packed with people. You are given a card as it is a self-service system.
We opted for the truffle pizza special the first time and the second time, I chose the truffle pasta while my boyfriend opted for the pasta al crema di funghi.
The pizza was delicious! Full of Truffle cream and topped with a generous amount of parmesan shavings and walnuts. Yum!!
My truffle pasta was a tad disappointing as it was bland. My boyfriend's pasta was so good, I ordered one for myself as an extra and it was delicious! The mushroom cream was thick and tasty. Portions are satisfying and prices are fair especially when compared to restaurants in Disney.
Staff nothing special but I would recommend it for a cheap(ish) meal",Date of visit: December 2019,Vapiano Disney Village,1,"Chessy, France"
Best restaurant in Disney Village!,"I had visited this restaurant three times when I first visited Disneyland Paris 3 years ago and I remember it being very good with big portions. So this time round, I suggested to my boyfriend to dine here also. It was so good, we dined here four times this year!
We tried the following: BBQ ribs, Nachos, Wings, Lasagna, Noodles, Mac Attack burger, Ribeye, Comet Milkshake and Super Sundae Brownie
The food is exquisite! The wings were the only thing we disliked (tasted like vinegar) and the burger was nothing special for its price. However, the BBQ Ribs were among the best we ever had and were enormous! The meat came right off the bones and was so tender! The fries are assorted: normal, curly and waffle fries. They are sublime! The nachos are TO DIE FOR! We had them once with extra pulled pork and once with extra BBQ chicken. They are huge and almost filling by themselves! They have delicious melted cheese, aour cream, beans, guacamole and pico do gallo. Amazing! Pasta dishes were unique and very tasty. The desserts are a MUST! Yes, the prices are high but the sundae with hot brownies and Chocolate and vanilla ice cream was divine and super in presentation! The comet Milkshake was decorated with mouthwatering sweets and was very thick and pleasant.
The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Service was excellent and quick. Prices are high but considering the location and the quantity and quality of the food, it is very fair
Our favourite spot in Disney!",Date of visit: December 2019,Planet Hollywood,1,"Marne-la-Vallee, France"
"Comfortable, excellent breakfast and close to Disneyland!","We stayed here for 7 nights as we were planning a 5-day trip to Disneyland Paris. As most of the hotels in the area, this one has a free shuttle bus service every ten minutes going to Disney and coming back. This provided us with a fast and efficient way to get to Disney
The buffet breakfast was surprising. It is by far the best breakfast I'd ever had in a hotel. The choices are vast and will please everyone! The breakfast contained: baked beans, eggs, sausages, the cispiest and saltiest bacon ever, baguettes, pound cake, cereals, jams, compotes, canned and fresh fruit, ham, cheese, yogurt, the most amazing pastries in the world (crunchy croissants and delicious pain au Chocolat), buckets full of nutella, maple syrup and a pancake machine!!!!!! Not to mention the wide array of cold and hot drinks (amazing hot chocolate)

Abundant and delicious food in an unexpected place!,"We celebrated my cousin's Confirmation dinner at this quaint small restaurant in the heart of Haz-Zebbug. Upon entering, it gives you the impression that this was an old townhouse converted into a restaurant. The decor is antique, yet innovative. They use used tomato sauce tins as cutlery holders which is a great recycling idea. The toilets are clean but small, decorated with a black board with chalk so that guests can write a message. The sink basin is an old wine barrell which was also very cool.
First we had three rounds of appetizers:
1. Cold cuts and cheese platter - contained salami, brie cheese, blue cheese and other cheeses, bread biscuits and cranberry jam. This was delicious and a great entree
2. Stuffed mushrooms - porcini mushrooms stuffed with speck and filled with a DIVINE mushroom sauce infused with melted cheese. This was a mind-blowing dish, everyone was super impressed by these Heavenly bites!
3. Vitello tonnato - thinly cut veal pieces served with a cold tuna paste. This was also good
Then as a starter we had the risotto Porcini Mushroom with speck, mushroom soup or orechiette bolognese. Both dishes were homemade and delicious, the risotto especially was savoury and thick with a nice salitiness to it. Those who had mushroom soup were blown away by how good it was
Mains we all had the tagliata served with parmesan, cherry tomatoes and roasted veg and potatoes. Now being a fries fan, I was sceptical about the roasted potatoes. However these were so sublime that I ordered an extra portion! Cut in wedges, they were crispy yet soft and contained thr right amount of salt and oil! The meat was juicy and tender. Perfect parmesan to complement it. Recommended!
Service was friendly and very good portions. Amazing food and great prices. Pleasantly surprised!",Date of visit: November 2019,Lokomotif Kafe,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Most divine cakes in the island!!,"Visited this beautiful place for the second time on a lovely Sunday morning. As we went at 10am, the place wasn't packed and we chose a seat on the terrace overlooking the bastions, surrounded by breathtaking views of the surrounding areas.
I opted for the classic chocolate cake, the cassatella cake and the strawberry meringue. I also took the Perugina Flavoured Hot Chocolate coconut flavour. The hot chocolate was a tad too thick and I preferred the chocolate orange flavour that I had opted for the previous time. Nonetheless, it was enjoyable!
The cakes....were too good to describe in words!!! The chocolate cake is huge, moist and has the most divine ganache top layer ever... perfect for chocaholics!! The cassatella was one of the best I'd ever had, and this cake is my favourite kind of cake! It was light, the ricotta filling was fresh and contained pieces of candied fruit and hazelnuts, delicious! The strawberry meringue had a lovely crust and was light and airy. Very good!
Service was beyond exceptional, the waiter spilled some of my friend's capuccino and immediately changed it to a new one. Price reflects the quality and quantity of the food.

Amazing pizza and a wide variety of choices!,"Visited on a Saturday evening after seeing a lot of good reviews about the pizzas. The menu boasts over 40 choices of pizza, and upon entering one immediately gets the vibe that this is a genuine pizza haven.
My boyfriend chose the Zaza' pizza which contained pistachio cream, crushed pistachios and speck while I chose the Tartuffata pizza which contained mushrooms, truffle cream and speck
The pizza dough was light and fluffy and not filling at all. The ingredients were amazing! Both pizzas were divine: the pistachio cream was buttery smooth and the truffle on my pizza was potent and amazing! The speck was salty and went very well with the other ingredients.
Service was nothing special, pizzas came out very quickly and the price was 13 euro per pizza, which was fair for the quality.
A highly recommended pizza place! Will definitely visit again!",Date of visit: November 2019,Al Legna Pizzeria,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Amazing sweets and great service!,"This quaint cafe is found exactly beside the Attard church. The ambiance is very cosy and provides a very good positive vibe. We sat outside on the pavement surrounded by bushes and trees and were greeted and served by a polite, young waitress who was ways smiling. My mum ordered an English breakfast, while I ordered their notorious red velvet cake, caramel chocolate brownie, scones and a red velvet Oreo Milkshake. The English breakfast was sizeable and came with free tea or coffee. My sweets were presented very nicely and portions were large. The brownie was very flavorful, the oozing caramel fudge complement the dense chocolate taste of the brownie which was very thick and filled with amazing whole hazelnuts for a nice crunch. The scones were also tasty, however a bit too soft for my liking. However, the homemade strawberry jam was spot on! The red velvet oreo Milkshake was divine! One of the best I've ever had! As for the red velvet cake...now I am not so keen on that kind of cake however this one was TO DIE FOR! it contained layers of cake sandwiched between layers of cream cheese which provided the most moist and delicate red velvet texture I'd ever tried! No wonder this place is renowned for this cake!!

Fantastic Churros and Milkshakes!,"Went especially for their unique churros. Tried the Kinder Bueno Churro Dog and the filled churro box which you can customise to your liking. I chose nutella as a filling, pistachio cream as a sauce and nuts as a topping. The churros are huge, fat freshly fried bites from Heaven! The outside crust is very crispy and they are soft on the inside. The chocolate oozes from the inside and provides the perfect dessert! Also tried the Oreo Milkshake which was huge and divine!

Amazing and original concept!,"After coming across this restaurant on social media and seeing positive reviews of the food, I was keen on visiting this establishment in Valletta. My friend and I visited for Saturday lunch. The waiters were very friendly and welcoming and greeted us with a smile. We opted for two courses. For the first, my friend opted for the flat bread with babaganoush and I ordered the homemade agnolotti (the dish I actually came here for, as it is their signature dish). The flat bread was vegan and was exquisite: crunchy flat bread and delicate topping which tasted like hummus. My agnolotti were out of this world delicious! They are served in a deep bowl with a spoon! This is because they are not cooked in a sauce, but just infused with a pork reduction which was salty and just incredible! I sipped it all up as you simply cannot waste a drop of it! The pasta was fresh and parcel-shaped. When biting into each agnolotti, it bursts in your mouth, releasing the liquid parmeggiano cheese which is simply DIVINE. I am telling you, you cannot miss this dish!!!!
For seconds, my friend ordered the brisket burger with sweet potato fries while I took the pulled pork ftira, pulled pork balls and sweet potato fries. The burger was liked by my friend, however the bun wasn't big enough to hold the ingredients together. The ftira was delicious, the Applewood cheese really came through. It could have used some more sweetness, but it was extremely enjoyable! The balls were also a nice bite and the fries were exquisite and huge portion!!
The bill came at 65 euro for the food mentioned, 2 pints of drinks and a small water. Not the cheapest, but it reflects the quality and quantity of the food.
I would most definitely recommend this restaurant. Original dishes, freshly prepared food and amazing taste!",Date of visit: October 2019,The Pulled Meat,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Good food and nice ambiance,"Visited on a busy Sunday lunch with a close friend of mine.
The ambiance is very pleasant, with a lovely view of the Gzira front outdoors, and a chic decor indoors.
I opted for a full rack of ribs called 'Sharlon' while my friend opted for the pasta with cream, chicken, mushrooms and bacon called 'behind closed doors'
My rack was served very nicely, with coreslaw and chips on the side. The portion for me was quite small, to my surprise, and I was st.ill hungry after devouring them. However, the sauce the most amazing BBQ sauce I had ever had on ribs (being a ribs fanatic, this was huge). The maple gave the rack a perfect sweetness which was not overpowering. I then ordered the same pasta my friend had and this was a huge portion. It was very good in taste, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I then opted for the 'Vella Nutella' dessert which was a pie filled with rich nutella and topped with ice cream, whipped cream and drenched in a lovely fudge sauce. It was also quite nice.
Why not five stars? The staff was fine but nothing special, asked if the ribs were meant to be that size, she said she would check but never came back. Also the prices on their Facebook page differed from the actual prices, which were higher in reality
Overall, a satisfactory experience at this lovely restaurant and would recommend it to anyone who's never tried it",Date of visit: October 2019,Paparazzi 29 Clubhouse,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Astonishing in all aspects!,"Visited this fine establishment after multiple recommendations from friends. We chose to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday here on a lovely Friday evening.
Upon arrival, we were greeted by the most amazing ambiance we have ever seen when it comes to restaurants: the terrace overlooks the Mgarr Harbour, with crystal clear views of the ferries and lovely sea. The decor is chic and romantic, no wonder why many weddings are hosted here!
We were given a table right at the edge, best views as we were seated at the periphery of the restaurant. The service was very attentive, waiters were cordial and diligent and offered service with a smile throughout. The manager kept checking on us to ensure everything was up to standard, and kindly offered us complimentary liquor.
Now on to the food. We were primarily given complimentary bruschetta with sundried tomatoes on the side, as well as a basket with warm bread rolls. This was a tasty appetizer. Next, my boyfriend opted for the ravioli special for starter, serviced with a butter sauce, pistachios and pine nuts, while I tried the fried brie served with cranberry sauce. Both dishes were unique and marvelous in taste and presentation. For mains we tried the fillet mignon and the gnocchi. The fillet was so tender, it easily melts in your mouth. The sauce was rich in wine and had a very nice savoury kick to it, even though it could have been a tad less salty. My gnocchi were divine: covered with melted cheese sauce and full of truffle cream. Heavenly!
Price for 2 starters and mains and 3 drinks amounted to 77 euro which is more than fair for the portion and quality we got!

Amazing pasta and ribs!,"This place is always jam-packed as it's found in the busy square of Bugibba. We made a booking beforehand in order to secure a spot. We arrived just in time to order cocktails during the last ten minutes of the happy hour, so my boyfriend ordered two. We ordered our food: ribs for him and garganelli with salmon and Prawns for myself. The food and my coke came, but no cocktails arrived. We brought this to their attention many times, they said there was only one barman serving the entire restaurant and lounge and that is why they were delayed. However, all was forgiven when they kindly offered both cocktails on the house for the delay and also offered us free desserts!!!!! We were very pleased with the effort they made!
The cocktails (Moscow Mule) were divine. The food was exceptional! The BBQ ribs were large and basted with a delicate honey sauce and were meaty and juicy. My pasta was phenomenal, fulk of succulent prawns, lovely smoked salmon which gave an exquisite saltiness to the dish and beautiful caviar. The sauce was rich and savoury and very memorable - so nice and creamy!
The ambiance is enjoyable and the staff is welcoming. Prices are fair and portions are large
Definitely recommended! Will be back to try other pasta dishes also!",Date of visit: September 2019,Victoria Gastropub,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
AMAZING!,"Visited for the second time. Took a pulled pork ftira and a Cookie jar milkshake. The food is very aesthetically pleasing. The ftira was served toasted with juicy succulent pulled pork cooked in a delicious BBQ sauce and a crunchy slaw. The milkshake complimented this tasty sandwich perfectly, the shake was huge! The milkshake itself tasted like crushed cookies and was thick and full of cookie pieces. The milkshake was topped with whipped cream and two yummy chocolate chip cookies which were fresh and so soft! The plate was also filled with a cookie crumb, caramel and chocolate sauce concoction, which was ever so messy but soooooo delicious to gobble up! Perfect for those with a sweet tooth!

Five stars are not enough!,"After coming across good reviews both online and from friends about this restaurant, we were curious to find out whether this spot was truly the best pasta spot in Malta, which is quite a huge statement to make.
We arrived at 7pm (with a reservation) and were welcomed to a very quaint, small yet very homely interior. Old photographs hang on the walls, a wine cellar is visible along the walls of the restaurant and big signs with witty and humerous statements can be seen scattered inside and outside the place.
The team was Italian. Very friendly to say the least. They made a mistake with my mum's starter, and they kept apologising for this humble mistake.
When the food arrived, the mistake was immediately forgotten. We were given complimentary omelette squares which were simply delicious! For the first course my mum had the cacio e pepe pasta while I had the notorious carbonara. We were simply BLOWN AWAY by the quality of the dishes: my carbonara was very salty (in a good way) and they managed to make it so creamy WITHOUT adding cream to the dish (just as the Italian way is supposed to be). For the second course my mum took the Saltimbocca (a veal dish) while I took the cacio e pepe with extra truffles. OH MY GOODNESS we were impressed and astonished yet again by the quality of the food. The sauce was nice and cheesy and the truffles just added the best depth of flavour! I am so glad I had two pasta dishes as they are equally phenomenal. Mum really liked the veal dish also
The place is renowned and busy so be sure to book. They kept refuting people without a reservation.

"Perfect ambiance, spectacular service and top-notch food!!","Being from the North, my boyfriend and I were always keen on visiting Tex Mex South. When we entered the establishment, we were welcomed by a super stylish interior, a lot of flat screen TVs, cosy armchairs and sofas, a very lovely decorated bar, and all the little details which gave the place a very positive vibe to it: from the amazing leather menus to the personalised wet wipes.
We shared a pizzotto starter, I had the BBQ ribs and my boyfriend had the cider apple and honey ribs for mains, three cocktails and a mud pie for dessert. The pizzotto was divine! Served on a wooden chopping board, it had a Twisted shape and was served hot with oozing mozzarella, garlic butter and rucola. It went down very nicely and we were very surprised with its amazing taste. The ribs came and were generous in portion. My rack was amazing, coated with delicious sticky BBQ sauce and oh my God those sweet potato fries are to die for!! My boyfriend's ribs were a tad underdone, and the sauce tasted alot like apple puree which was a bit much, even though I took some of his and I enjoyed them, even though mine were admittedly better cooked and fell off the bone. The mud pie was presented very nicely. It was a mixture of ice cream and cookie layer, with crushed oreo cookie crumbs on top and bottom, nutella drizziled at the base and some nice cone pieces on top. My boyfriend and I both loved it! It was a very unique and different dessert which is definitely worth a try! Cocktails were numerous in choice and very pleasant too
Service was amazing, staff made sure everything was up to standard. We were offered complimentary liquor at the end. Price came up to 80 euro total which is fair considering portion sizes and quality of food

Astonishingly delicious!,"Having seen posts online from others and the restaurant itself, my friend and I were curious to try out Bandit's notoriously unique food items. We chose to dine in on a Sunday for lunch. The place is TINY with only 3 tables. The lovely young man who was handling the food was great and very helpful. My friend opted for the Brie and Bacon burger with sweet potato fries while I took a beastly feast of the Bourbon Pork burger, chicken waffle, loaded bacon and cheese fries and extra garlic mayo and cheese sauce on the side. Every single food item was DIVINE! The pulled pork cooked in Bourbon sauce was sweet but not too sweet, the cabbage and cheese sauce provided an excellent flavour profile of gooey yet delicate pork which was messy, but fun to eat. The cheese and bacon fries were very nice, oozing with their house cheese sauce which is similar to nacho cheese: warm and melted. The saltiness of the fries was very enjoyable. My friend's burger was also divine: the fried brie was sweet and powerful and the patty was lovely and juicy. Finally...that chicken waffle!!!! WOW WHAT AN AMAZING FOOD ITEM!! The chicken was freshly fried and was tender and succulent, the waffle itself was crispy and had the most amazing sweet touch to it due to the maple syrup...We were both blown away by the quality of the food!

Exquisite and fine desserts!,"The positive reviews both online and from my friends had been compelling me to visit this establishment. The interior is very nicely decorated: a quaint, relaxing environment with a very welcoming vibe. Ordered the chocolate mousse cronut and the salted caramel and pecan eclair. The cronut was crunchy and powdered with sugar, it had a nice crunch and donut taste to it. The mousse filling was light and delicate and complimented the dough. The eclair was absolutely gorgeous! I usually dislike eclairs, but the lovely sweet icing, caramelised pecans and salted caramel flavoured cream inside was a bite from Heaven! Wow! The prices are a bit higher than ordinary cafes, but trust me, it's worth the visit!

Perfection!,"The title says it all. After the renowned Maltese chef, Daniel Grech, took over this establishment,it was a must for us to visit!
The restaurant is exactly by the sea and is open-air. This allows people to enjoy a magnificent view of the Sliema coastline which is gorgeous. The decor is very cool and youthful, with wooden panels and a relaxed atmosphere. Nice music played in the background.
You have to place your order by the bar and pay beforehand, which is understandable considering its an open restaurant so people can easily run off without paying.
My friends both opted for the octopus salad which was delicious and full of tender octopus tentacles.
I had the Brie burger with sweet potato waffle fries and brie bites on the side. The brie bites were amazing: fried brie balls which were bite-sized and complimented with a sweet and tangy sauce. They were soft and tasted amazing! Who doesn't like oozing cheese?!
The burger was beyond perfection. The melted brie went well with the sweet mango chutney and caramelized onions. The patty itself was juicy and divine! The buns were soft and large enough to enable you to bite into the delicious burger without having the ingredients fall off. The sweet potato waffle fries were crispy and phenomenal: not too sweet but sweet enough to enjoy the distinct taste of the sweet potato. Their texture was great too!
Staff was a bit slow but the place was busy...it always seems to be! Prices are fair with two salads, burger, side dish and 4 drinks amounting to 51 euro.

You can choose between churros, waffles, mqaret, ice cream and crepes and choose any sauce such as nutella, white or dark chocolate, caramel etc and various toppings like Helwa tat tork, Reese's, marshmallow, dairy milk, nuts, you name it!
I opted for medium churros which gave me 6 long churros. I opted for nutella and milk chocolate sauce and helwa tat-Tork and Twix as toppings. I also took two donuts one was freshly made with the toppings I created: white chocolate, smarties and maltesers. The other was pre-made with nutella filling and caramel and Reese's chocolate as toppings
The fresh donut was too sweet,the white chocolate in particular. And was a bit hard to take a bite off as it was a taf chewy. The other donut however was divine! The nutella filling was Heavenly and the Reese's chocolate and caramel complimented the donut very well! The churros were nice warm and crispy with a lot of oozing hot nutella! The helwa tat-Tork was a divine topping which made the churros delicious and perfect!

Best in Gozo!,"Being used to amazing ice cream, my boyfriend and I had always been disappointed with the lack of really good desserts in Gozo. Finally,we can say we found the perfect ice cream truck situated in either Ramla Bay or in Victoria (Arkadia car park). This truck serves an array of delicious ice creams from regular scoops, to soft ice cream, sundaes, flurries, fruit mixes, you name it!
We opted for a Nutella and Oreo sundae and a Crunchie flurry...WOW!!!!words are not enough to describe how good these were! The sundae was FULL of delicious hot nutella and large oreo pieces and the flurry was mixed extremely well with pieces of crunchie chocolate, which were abundant!
Very good value too, with 3 ice creams amounting to 7 euro
A MUST!",Date of visit: July 2019,Champions Ice-Cream,1,"Island of Gozo, Malta"
Visited twice for lunch!!!,"This is quite a famous bakery in Amsterdam. Mostly renowned for their amazing churros, they serve a wide variety of pastries, from savoury ciabattas and croissants to sweet waffles, macaroons and pies.
First time we opted for a cherry tart, churros with nutella and a waffle with white chocolate and strawberries. The waffle was one of the best I've ever had, warm and soft, white choc and strawberry combination was to die for! Churros were served fresh, piping hot and DRENCHED with delicious oozing hot nutella. Portion was huge! Second time opted for some savoury breads which were okay, then took a waffle with nutella, caramel and banana (again, divine!) And plain churros with powdered sugar. Once again, food was delicious, impeccable and filling! Price is quite high, total around 30 euro for all items (first time amounted to around 20). Totally worth it for the best waffles and churros in Amsterdam!",Date of visit: June 2019,Rene's Croissanterie,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Best Dutch pancakes!!,"Mum and I visited this place twice after seeing amazing reviews on both TripAdvisor and Instagram. The queues here get quite long so prepare yourself! Whether raining or sunny, people get eagerly in line to be seated at this place. We visited the one nearest the Red Light district and close to train station. Being only two people, we were seated fairly quickly.
The first time we I took the apple crumble Dutch pancake. It arrived beautifully presented with a huge entire piece of apple pie crumbled on the pancake and ice cream. Also ordered chocolate on the side. The taste was DIVINE! the cake was fresh and oozing with apple goodness. Chocolate sauce was rich and delightful. The ice cream provided a freshness which was exquisite. Mum opted for the Dutch pancake with camembert, gammon (or ham) and raspberry sauce. I took a piece and it was also impeccable: nice saltiness from the camembert and lovely sweetness from raspberry sauce.
Second time mum took the same while I tried their staple bacon and cheese. Again, food was perfect! I preferred the apple crumble pancake, but all options were amazing!
Staff was out of this world! Huge thanks to Sarah for the amazing hospitality and for chatting with us and delivering service with a smile despite the place being sooo busy!
Atmosphere is very relaxing and quaint. Second visit there was a band playing some relaxing jazz music while we ate breakfast. Delightful!
They also give you a free keychain with every visit. They only accept card payments. Prices not cheap: 35 euro for 2 pancakes and two juices. But totally worth it!
Do not miss this place!!!!!",Date of visit: June 2019,PANCAKES Amsterdam Centraal,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
WOW!!,"After coming across this quaint cafeteria on Instagram, I thought it would be a must to visit while in Amsterdam. The place is very small but decorated like an American style diner: cute tables with sofa booths, neon signs and very welcoming. Two young men were there and were very friendly. They seemed to be doing everything: taking orders, cooking and even bartending
My mum opted for the pancake stacked with banana, strawberries and bacon while I chose their Red M&M pancake: red velvet pancakes topped with white chocolate, banana, strawberries, blueberries, M&Ms and served with maple syrup and dried cranberries on the side. Also opted for a side of nutella as extra. I ordered their oreo milkshake also. The food was phenomenal! The food is truly as beautiful as the pictures posted on Instagram! Magnificent pancakes with a delicious combination of flavors! The milkshake was also divine!
I would definitely recommend this place a hundred times!",Date of visit: June 2019,Toast It,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
First meal in Amsterdam!,"After arriving at 1pm, we were tired and hungry. This cafeteria was very near to our hotel and I had seen the posts on Instagram which had me intrigued
My mum opted for a toast with goat cheese, caramelised apple and walnut while I took their chocolate freakshake
Everything was phenomenal! My mum thoroughly enjoyed her toastie and my shake was HUGE and stacked with mouthwatering goodies like kitkat, kinder bueno, cookies, waffles and a yummy donut!
Prices are expensive: toast 9 euro and shake 13.50. But totally worth it! Nice small quaint place with lovely decor: great eye for detail!
Highly recommended!",Date of visit: June 2019,Ree7,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Feels like home!,"Wanting to try local cuisine in Amsterdam, we visited this restaurant twice during our week stay. First time opted for the traditional stamppot served with either a meatball or sausage, mashed potatoes infused with vegetables and gravy. My mum tried the chicken skewers with peanut sauce. Both dishes were divine and felt so comforting! Felt like a huge bear hug! Stamppit may not look appetizing but trust me, it reaaallyyy is! Do not miss it! The waitress Monique was beyond welcoming. We were late for our reservation due to a valid reason and even though the restaurant was jam packed, she managed to give is a table within minutes!
The second time we opted for their famous ribs which they claim to be the best in Amsterdam. Portion was big with multiple garnishes and sauces served on the side. The meat was tender and fell right off the bone and was exquisite! Beer is also amazing! Try the blonde variety!
Would definitely recommend just be sure to book beforehand as it's always full!",Date of visit: June 2019,Cafe Sonneveld,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Different cuisine,"Visited this place after seeing alot of posts on Instagram showing their bombastic burgers. Cuisine is entirely vegan and the menu is varied and unique. Can't fault the creativity and chic ambiance! The place has a cool vibe to it which is very entertaining.
Mum and I ordered the Daddy Mac Chick'n burgers with sweet potato fries, parmesan fries and also bitterballen on the side.
The bitterballen and parmesan fries were quite good. Portions very big and amazingly presented food!
The burger was good but nothing special...good attempt at mimicking actual chicken meat but you can feel that something is missing (being meat eaters). There is an artificial sense to the food. But I still enjoyed the meal nonetheless, and i would imagine it is a paradise for vegans!
Only accept payment by card. Staff is very nice and prices are not too expensive",Date of visit: June 2019,Vegan Junk Food Bar,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Best pizza of my life!!!,"Visited this establishment after seeing such good reviews online.
The ambiance is very lovely, you can tell it's a bit more 'fine dining' than other restaurants. All staff is Italian from chefs to waiters, which is good considering it being an Italian restaurant.
We went there twice during our week stay
The first time we opted for a pizza each: mine was truffle (Tartufi) and my mum's was 5 formaggi. Both were sublime! It was the best pizza I've ever had in my life! The toppings were generous with ample truffle shavings and divine truffle cream...simply a wow!
Second time I had the truffle pasta (Tartufiko) while my mum had the melanzana and then we shared the pizza with sundried tomatoes and burrata.
The melanzana and pasta were once again impeccable! The pizza was nothing special for 18 euro
The staff is amazing and simply so kind and welcoming! The only thing I'd critisize is the price - a bit pricey. Pizzas averaging 18 euro, truffle pasta 24 euro and cheesecake 12 euro.
However I would say I'd definitely visit this fine establishment again. Be sure to book as it gets super busy!!",Date of visit: June 2019,Fiko,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Best restaurant we've visited in Amsterdam!,"We had reserved this restaurant twice before we even arrived in Amsterdam, due to the immense popularity we had seen online. The first time we visited Cannibale Royale in Handboogstraat (closer to the 9 streets area) while the second time we visited the Niegel area (Red Light District). We tried the famous ribs, the Le Cannibale Royale burger, sweet potato fries and Mac n Cheese.
Everything was the definition of perfection! I just simply cannot emphasize enough how amazing everything was ! The ribs were tender and char grilled to perfection. Meat fell right off the bone. BBQ sauce served on the side was fresh and tasty! I had never been a fan of sweet potato fries but my-oh-my this place made me a believer! They were addictive! The Mac n Cheese was gooey and oozing with creamy cheesy goodness and was the most comforting food ever!. My mum is not a ribs fan but she said they were the best she'd ever had, so much so that she took them on the 2nd visit also! The burger I took included juicy succulent pulled pork which was TO DIE FOR! The patty was cooked pink in the middle and was soft and tender. I asked for the BBQ sauce to be served on the side and it was also delicious!
Ambience is very hip and cool! Dark lighting, chill and youthful. Staff was amazing! Very helpful, fun and perfect
Need I say more? Make sure you book and visit this place. I cannot recommend it enough!",Date of visit: June 2019,Cannibale Royale,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
"Central, clean and amazing staff!","As everyone pretty much knows, accommodation in Amsterdam is pretty expensive! We found this tiny hotel in the centre, just two minutes walk from Dam Square. We paid 835 euro for 2 people for 7 nights. Not the cheapest but a pretty good deal for an expensive city!
The price included a small breakfast served at our rooms every morning: fresh sliced bread, cheese, salami, boiled eggs, juice and jam. We decided to refuse as the food in the city is so amazing, but still a nice gesture.
The room was very small. Had a nice private shower and sink but we shared a toilet with the other 3 rooms on our floor. We had a lovely balcony overlooking the main street with chairs and a table. The room was spotless clean daily and very comfortable.
The staff was beyond amazing! A family runs this hotel and you can tell they enjoy their business. Sam was wonderful and very helpful. A+ for the exceptional service!
The only downside was the steep staircase which you have to carry your luggage up and down...not very safe. Would not recommend for very unfit or elderly persons with mobility issues.
All in all, we were very happy and enjoyed our stay at this hotel. I highly recommend it!",Date of stay: June 2019,Hotel de Westertoren,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Great and genuine flavours!,"This place is always jam packed with people and queues tend to get long...we decided to give it a try as it wasn't as busy when we passed by.
I opted for a small cone with 3 flavours: Blueberry cheesecake, coconut and chocolate Hazelnut. My boyfriend opted for a medium cone with 4 flavours: mango, mint , figs and something else I can't remember
He fell in love with the fig flavour. I absolutely loved the coconut and blueberry cheesecake flavours. All were so authentic and genuine !! Staff were beyond helpful and informative so that's also a 10/10.

Price is very expensive: 10 euro for small and medium cones. However very good quality. Highly recommended!",Date of visit: May 2019,Amorino Malta Valletta,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Never disappoints!!,"A huge well done once again goes to Daniel and his team, for the exquisite dishes from start to finish...perfect ambiance, romantic decor, beautifully plated dishes and delicious combination of flavours!
Starters: Divine foie gras served on a thin crisp toast and delicious sweet chutney, crispy tasty pork belly fries with an amazing dipping sauce and soft and delicate scallops with a mouthwatering pea puree
Mains: their unbelievably out-of-this-world beef fillet and truffle tagliatelle and juicy succulent spaghetti Lobster with an amazing thick bisque and king prawns
Pasta was freshly made at that instant. Prices are very fair for the quality of food!
A personal favourite and a true gem!",Date of visit: May 2019,City Lounge,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Amazing from start to finish!!,"Visited for the first time last Saturday. We arrived exactly at 12pm as it was about to open, and with us another 3 tables immediately entered. We knew right then that this restaurant is popular among the locals
The view is amazing: you can see all of the beach around you, the beautiful weather made the ambiance even more glorious. The interior was decorated beautifully: light and bright colours, quaint and dainty glass cups on the table, lovely fresh fish on display, the pizzaiolo baking pizzas in front of the customers; simply wow!
For starters my mum opted for spaghetti octopus and I opted for the steamed buns. Both of us thought our dishes were phenomenal! The octopus was very tender and spaghetti melted in your mouth, the buns were soft and filled with juicy succulent pulled beef and topped with sesame seeds: Perfection!
For mains we both opted for pizza:my mum Radicchio e noci with speck and caramelised walnuts while I opted for pizza pistacchio with pistacchio cream and mortadella. We were given a choice of 3 dough types: Napolitana, siciliana or sette cereali (whole grain). The sette cereali dough was addictive, full of seeds and was very soft and fluffy. The pistacchio cream was divine and my mum also enjoyed her pizza
For dessert we opted for imqaret (date fritters) and the brownie...the brownie was SUPERB! Served hot with delcious homemade ice cream and pistachios! The date fritters were also delicious and it was evident that they were homemade.
We were given complimentary liquor and small chocolate vol au vents at the end which was a nice touch
The service was spot on! The waiters made helpful suggestions, were very friendly and always checking whether the food was perfect. Well done Pierre for operating this fine establishment!
Price was fair: 3 course meal for 2 persons plus 3 alcoholic drinks, and one cocktail for 85 euro
WILL VISIT AGAIN!!!",Date of visit: May 2019,Il Pirata Mellieha Bay,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Blown away....one of the top in Malta!,"Visited this gem on a sunny Sunday for lunch. The ambience on the inside was very pleasant: a huge interior with lovely decor, very clean and nice background music.
We were served by three lovely waiters. Being a bit picky on our preferences, my friend and I both ordered the pizza bianca, however, with different requirements/amendments to each pizza. We were certain the waiters would either forget or that our requests will somehow be mixed up.
When the food arrived (very quickly) we were delighted to see our individual pizzas were exactly as requested!
The pizza had a lovely boat shape, was filled with scrumptious mozzarella and oozing cream cheese, and topped with bacon, rucola, sweet corn, mushrooms and a runny egg. Each bite was a piece of Heaven! The dough was thick but soft, a divine dish! I would be more than happy to eat this every day!
As for dessert, opted for their special churros: tiny pieces of amazing churros covered with ample nutella and white chocolate, crushed biscuits and pistachios, and topped with kinder fingers. I was blown away by this amazing dessert! A true chocaholic's DREAM!
service was fantastic, always checking on whether the food met our expectations.
Bottom line is, I found another favourite restaurant. DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE!!",Date of visit: April 2019,Cardini,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Mind blowing!!! favourite in Gozo!,"Visited this gem of a restaurant for the third time. We always fall in love with the ambiance: great view of the bay, lovely terrace, romantic setting and amazing service
Opted for my favourite dish: spaghetti with rabbit - this is the only place I enjoy this dish! They serve a huge bowl of pasta with amazing sauce and Hugee pieces of rabbit including liver! My boyfriend and I licked our plates clean!
I usually never take desserts from restaurants, especially ones like these in tiny pretty glasses (which I consider small portions). But this time I decided it to give them a shot. Waitress came out with the display of homemade desserts. I opted for the snickers mousse which was pretty and delicate. When i took a bit, OMG I fell in love!it was layered with dense chocolate ganache, a velvety snickers mousse and caramel,peanuts and a soft biscuit base at the bottom...I was overwhelmed with the taste of this divine dessert! In fact, I HAD to order the baci mousse after, which was also dovine! Rich,chocolatey goodness with hazelnuts and a pure baci taste!

Cocktails also very nice. Price for 2 large pasta plates, 2 cocktails and 2 desserts 43 euro!!

A MUST WHEN IN GOZO!!",Date of visit: April 2019,Qbajjar Restaurant,1,"Island of Gozo, Malta"
BLOWS US AWAY every time!!,"We always make it a must to visit this place when we go to Gozo. We have tried plenty of their ftiras, pizzas and pies. Everything was excellent.
This time decided to change a bit and went for the Mekrens special - a ftira with fresh cheeselets, peppered cheeselets, maltese sausage and potatoes. This was by far the best ftira I have ever tried in my life...full of fresh ingredients and boy, am I missing it right now!!!!!
Service never disappoints, the owners are humble and excellent. Prices beyond worth it!!!
THANKS FOR THE CONSISTENT DIVINE FOOD!",Date of visit: April 2019,Mekren Bakery,1,"Island of Gozo, Malta"
Excellent service and atmosphere. Good food!,"Visited after hearing that this place has the best ribs in Gozo
Upon entering on a Saturday night, place was packed with locals. Atmosphere was very nice with candle lights, a loveley terrancr and welcoming decor
Waitresses were EXTREMELY professional, served us food with a smile, very enthusiastic and provided detailed information and recommendations on each fish we asked.
As for food, we ordered their famous chilli sizzling king prawns and ravioli for starters. Both were underwhelming and nothing special. Ravioli was a bit hard. Prawns presented beautifully but drowned in oil.
For mains we both took their infamous ribs. Upon arrival, the smell was bizzarre and it was because of the sauce -it was very rich in honey in fact was very dark in colour. However the taste was very good and the meat fell right off the bone which I found amazing! Portions were also plentiful!
One last remark: price amounted to 60 euro for 2 starters, 2 mains and 2 soft drinks. This was fine however their actual prices are not accurate as on the online menu. So an update is advisable.
Overall a good experience and would return!",Date of visit: April 2019,D`Bar Cafe Restaurant,1,"Island of Gozo, Malta"
Amazing food and huge portions!,"Visited this establishment for the first time. My family and I love our traditional Maltese cuisine and we know that Mgarr is the place to go for this food. However, over the years certain old-time favourites have lost their spark and have not been delivering consistency in terms of quality of food.
Thus, we took a chance and visited Tac-Canti. We ordered mixed rabbit, horse meat and snails. A free appetizer of Maltese water biscuits with cheese and bruschetta were served.
Main courses came with delicious thick fries and veg, as well as big baskets of delicious crispy Maltese bread. All the food was exquisite! The rabbit and horse were cooked in different gravy - rabbit was so juicy and tender and horse was plentiful and cooked in a sweet wine gravy which was (thankfully) plentiful! Snails were also very good! Everything was so delicious that we hungrily cleaned the plates of gravy with chips and bread!
Ordered desserts which were also good, but obviously the main course was the highlight!
What I absolutely loved was the free Helwa tat Tork and peanuts they served at the end! A lovely delicious treat!
Service was nothing special, some mistakes were made, some desserts were served and others took longer. However this is to be expected in Mgarr. Staff were nice and helpful which was enough!
Finally, price was very well worth the quality and quantity !! 18 euro per person for huge main course, dessert and 3 drinks each!
We found a new Mgarr favourite!",Date of visit: March 2019,Tac-Canti Bar and Restaurant,1,"Island of Gozo, Malta"
"Amazing from start to finish, beyond perfection!!","Visited on a sunny Saturday lunch at Hard Rock Cafe Valletta waterfront. The outside seating provided us with shelter from the cool breeze while still enjoying the sunny day with an amazing view of the Harbour.
We were served by Baze who was beyond exceptional from start to finish: he came always with a smile to our table, checked whether everything was fine and also did more than needed to make our visit memorable!
My friend ordered a lovely chicken and avocado salad which was huge with ample ingredients. I ordered their famous Hickory Smoked Ribs with Parmesan Romano fries. The fries are DEFINITELY worth the 1 euro upgrade!they were salty and full of intense parmesan flavour, the best fries I had ever eaten! Ribs were huge in portion, full of tender pork meat with very little fat, smoked with a charred perfection and glazed with an amazing, sweet sauce which was literally finger-licking and perfect. Beans with bacon on the side was also a rustic nice touch
For dessert ordered their special hot fudge brownie sundae which was big enough to share, but was so good ate it all by myself! The deeper you dig into the huge bowl of sundae, the more divine it becomes! Crushed walnuts and vanilla ice cream, followed by hot fudge and a delicious warm thich and dense brownie at the bottom:a chocolate lover's paradise!!was so good that I finished it all, despite being full.
Would definitely recommend this gem of a place. Perfection from start to finish!!",Date of visit: March 2019,Hard Rock Cafe,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Exceeded our expectations!!!,"Been meaning to visit this fine establishment ever since its management changed. Being a huge fan of Chef Daniel Grech and his culinary works, we were excited to experience this restaurant.
Upon arrival we were greeted with this extraordinarily beautiful interior, with huge wine cellar displays as you climb the spiral staircase and huge magnificent chandeliers. The inside of the restaurant is serene and very delicate: the chefs are working at a stone's throw from the tables, with ab open work area where one can see the dishes being prepared. The ambiance and decor is even more astounding at the outside terrace, where tables are beautifully laid with cloths, gas furnaces are surrounding the tables offering nice warmth and one can see a spectacular view of the Presidential Palace and St. George square beneath
Now for the food.
For startes my mother opted tor fried calamari which were served with squid ink tartar sauce while I opted for the double cooked Halloumi fries. Both dishes were creative and exquisite: a great start to our meal
For mains by mother opted for spaghetti alio, olio pepperoncino while I ordered their special tagliatelle beef fillet with truffle shavings. Oh...my.. God!!! The tagliatelle was the richest most mouthwatering plate of pasta I had ever eaten. Each mouthfull was a delight and piece of Heaven! Meat melts in your mouth, the amazing cream sauce with parmeggiano cheese was beyond perfect...we were blown away! It was so good that I didn't even dare smother it with grated cheese!
Last but not least was the great service. All waiters were friendly and kept checking whether everything was fine. It was amazing!
Also excellent value for money: starters, mains and 3 cokes for 50 euro!!!

"Good food, a tad chaotic!","Visited the Bugibba outlet after watching a movie. It was nice to head downstairs for a good pizza right at the same venue, which had a very nice ambiance and decor
My boyfriend and I ordered a Meat Buff pizza and Chicken Feast pizza as well as a Chicken Supreme taco
Pizzas were unique and great - very nice chicken and spicy meat as well as an amazing sesame seed crust. Taco was also delicious - warm, cheesy and crispy!!
Good value for money as the mentioned items plus a beer and diet coke amounted to 26 euro
The only thing to point out was the chaotic service - waitresses were baffled, running around asking who ordered this pizza and bringing wrong items to the table - however in their defence, it was a very busy rush hour, and they were very friendly and apologetic! So no issues there
Would definitely recommend this place for pizza and tacos if you fancy something different at an affordable price",Date of visit: February 2019,Amigos Pizza,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
"Organic, homemade and exquisite!","Located in a rather unappealing area, my friend and I were very surprised to see the tables full and people waiting to be seated!
Decor is lovely: a mix between modern and retro. Everything in the menu is homemade and organic - down to the lemonade and ice tea!
I opted for Belgian dark hot chocolate which was served with burnt marshmallows. This was amazing!!!
Then opted for their famous nutella french toast with cinnamon sugar and a side of honeycomb ice cream. The French toast was amazing with so much flavour and oozing with delicious nutella! Honeycomb Ice cream was very good and crunchy!
Also, had a sip from my friend's lemonade and it was sweet and refreshing - very original!
Service was good but only one waitress in a full place so would advise more staff

Very recommended!!!! Will be back to try the loaded fries ‚ù§‚ù§",Date of visit: February 2019,Danny's,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Overrated and overpriced,"Would recommend only certain dishes - such as brisket tortellacci and wings. sides were very good (mac n cheese and triple cooked fries). These were all divine
But rhe beef rib was fatty and was kindly replaced. However sauce was so strong, it was inedible - DRENCHED in what seemed to be a mixed concoction of soy sauce and something else that made it bitter. Brisket was also very fatty - both my friends pointed this out
Large portions and friendly staff. Overrated and pricey for the quality you get
So I would rate it as average and would not return",Date of visit: January 2019,fat Louie's,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"

Amazing quality and service!,"Have been visiting this establishment for a very long time. After the refurbishment last year, the place has improved even more both in terms of food and ambiance
Atmosphere is amazing, lovely terrace outside in the summer and very positive and homey atmosphere inside also.
Recently visited on Christmas day and new year day. New Year's Lunch ordered focaccia starter which was amazing, and BBQ ribs as main course. Ribs were enormous and very tender, just not hot enough, which is understandable as we were a big table on a busy day. Still a fabulous meal
On Christmas day lunch ordered calamari fritti starters which were abundant and very very good! Main courses opted for 3 Ps pasta with pulled pork and cream which was beyond sublime!! Amazing flavour! Also tasted mum's speciality Christmas turkey pizza which was also exquisite!

Finally had the opportunity to visit. Chose a kinder crepe with an additional scoop of their Lion flavoured ice cream.
The ice cream was realllyyyy pleasant and something you don't find everywhere!
Crepe itself looked on the smaller side, but taste was DIVINE! the melted kinder fingers made a world of a difference. Was soft and gooey in all the right ways!

Wish I can give more than 5 stars!!,"Being a burger and pancake lover and after visiting this establishment multiple times, this is by far my favourite place in Malta. This is my 3rd or 4th review but I just can't complement the staff enough for the excellent service and hospitality! Not to mention the exceptionally phenomenal food!
So this review is about my latest visit. Opted for a 300g Quattro formaggi burger which blew me away: you could easily distinguish each cheese, crispy onions added a crunch and thick guanciale was salty and amazing. The grape chutney was divine as it balanced the saltiness with some sweetness
Desserts opted for nutella biscuit pancake and my friend a lindt dark chocolate pancake. Both were exquisite, especially the nutella one!
Two burgers (one large one normal) fries, cheesy fries,two soft drinks and a coffee and water - 45 euro!!!!wow.

MUCH LOVE xxxx",Date of visit: November 2018,Shoreditch Bar & Kitchen,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
One of the best meals!,"To get things straight - I gave four stars not five due to my boyfriend's steak. He opted for a 350g USDA ribeye which cost 45 euro. Presentation was pretty dismal and he said was nothing special in quality either
On the other hand, my experience was of a whole other level!! We shared a speciality starter - ribs glazed in Bourbon sauce - Wow!!!! We were highly impressed
My mains was a special also - surf n turf consisting of half lobster and wagyu burger which chips and salad for 39 euro. The burger was juicy and tender and lobster was a taste of Heaven! Wow I felt like I was dreaming with every bite!

Wow worth every penny!,"My boyfriend being a fishing enthusiast, we decided to boom this trip for end September. We were a total of 3 couples so it was very easy to make friends as it was a small group.
The tour started quite close to the white beach where they pulled up their fishing cages and 800m long fishing net. They show you the catch as they pull them out. We had caught quite a few fish including squid and octopus!
Then they let you swim and give you snorkelling equipment. After they provide fishing rods and lines and fresh bait and show you how to fish. We caught some more fish this way which was very fun and exciting!
After, they cook all the freshly caught fish on board and provide you with a huge buffet of fresh fish, seafood, homecooked rice and salad and plenty of yummy bread! We were stuffed!
Captain was an amazing young lady who stayed with us and showed us everything she knew
She was also interested in getting to know us and sharing our own experiences
Also pick up from hotel and drop off at hotel was a great plus. Worth the price at 130 euro per person! Cheapest in Santorini!!!",Date of experience: September 2018,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,1,"Santorini, Greece"
One of the best experiences of our lives!,"Visited this gem for a five night stay. Was in Fira so the central location drew us to this villa. Little did we know that the service and ambiance was beyond our expectations!
The rooms are small apartments: a lovely bedroom with tv, balcony and a comfy double bed, a kitchen with all amenities and a very spacious bathroom with fabulous shower!
The pool is very relaxing, great area as only 7 minute walk to centre.
What I was really happy with was the amazing service. They greeted us and booked all that we needed (tours, restaurant reservations). They even helped me surprise my boyfriend with cake and champagne on his birthday!!!
Will definitely visit again. Highly recommended!!!!!!!",Date of stay: September 2018,Villa Ilios,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Wow one of a kind!!!!,"After multiple attempts at visiting, we were disappointed with not having the chance to eat at Debbie's. Once we were told kitchen was about to close, and the other time we found it closed in the morning.
After reading the reviews, we swore we would try again. And boy was it worth it!!
My boyfriend opted for a full English breakfast and I opted for their blueberry and coconut pancakes with nutella on the side
The food was BEYOND EXPECTATIONS - My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast. Toast was like a brick wall so huge!!
My pancakes were so fluffy and delicious- I didn't even need a knife to cut them! Blueberries really complimented the greek yogurt and very nice sweet maple syrup and the nutella was a great addition
We also took the most phenomenal milkshakes ever...Nutella !!
We were left speechless !
Service was also very nice and friendly

Do not miss this place....exceptional!",Date of visit: September 2018,Debbie's Cafe,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Our go-to place wherever in Gozo!,"This family run bakery never disappoints! Have visited countless times, each time ordering their ftiras, pizzas and baked goods!
We tried the cheese, tuna and anchovy and beef ftiras - all sublime! Personal favourite is beef!
Pizza tried capricciosa which is amazing!still made with bread dough (typical Gozitan)
Also tried their lampuki and pumpkin pies, muffins and qassatat - all delicious!
Not to mention the impeccable service each time and ridiculously cheap prices! Don't miss this gem of a bakery!",Date of visit: September 2018,Mekren Bakery,1,"Island of Gozo, Malta"
Wow! Amazing choice and prices!,"This gelateria is right beside the parking area in Xlendi. Being a huge fan of ice cream and having an obsession with Sotto Zero gelateria in Bugibba (arguably the best ice cream by a long shot), I was keen to try this gem of a place
Staff was extremely friendly and helpful! They had various of scoop flavours to choose from. Also a variety of cones dipped in nutella and nuts, milkshakes, soft ice cream and flurries! Not to mention the gazillion toppings one can choose from!
I opted for three scoops: belgian chocolate, red velvet and chocolate orange. I chose nutella, crunchie and dairy milk as toppings and a nut and nutella dipped waffle cone. My boyfriend opted for an oreo flurry with nutella
Both options were DIVINE! huge ice creams with intense and incredible flavour! The total price came to 7 euro for both huge desserts!
Highly recommended! Best ice cream and dessert place in Gozo, without a doubt!",Date of visit: September 2018,Gelateria Granola,1,"Island of Gozo, Malta"
Long wait but good food,"Visited on a public holiday on a Saturday night. Located in the busy village of Xlendi, it is a quaint restaurant right beside the parking area.
We ordered fillet with mushroom sauce and octopus in garlic. We were given complimentary bruschetta which was nice. Even though the restaurant was not full and there were plenty of waiters, food took 45 min to arrive
Fillet was cooked to perfection, mushroom sauce was the best I've ever had. Octopus was tender and cooked very well, with plenty of garlic sauce to dip their deliciously served hot bread! Finally we were given complimentary limoncello.
Prices are reasonable and menu very extensive...almost too varied!
Service was average, nothing particularly good or bad
Overall a great dining experience and recommended especially for fish lovers!",Date of visit: September 2018,Talija Restaurant,1,"Island of Gozo, Malta"
Go for the exquisite ribs!,"Visited as a group of 6 (3 couples). Ordered ribs, chicken, ribeye, burgers and pasta
My boyfriend's mushroom sauce was rather watery and not to his taste. However portions were all big and plentiful
My rack of honey and BBQ ribs were EXQUISITE!! as a rib-eater, I know my ribs and these were among the best!pork meat was very tender and fell right off the bone. Flesh was pink and sauce very delicious and not overpowering!!
French fries were also very tasty and crispy! Loved the whole experience!
Bottom line: if you are a ribs fan, you must come here!",Date of visit: August 2018,dBistro Restaurant,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Can't recommend this enough.....NEW THINGS TO TRY EVERY TIME!,"Been visiting this amazing ice cream shop since it opened around 6 years ago. And let me tell you, there is nothing that will ever disappoint!
Ice cream: exquisite over 30 flavours to choose from, new flavours each week, meet all dietary requirements , eah flavour is like tasting the original item; personal favourites are kinder sorpresa, ricotta e pera and whole nut cadbury.
Cake: they have the option of pre ordering either a semi freddo cake or a torta gelato. The latter being ice cream in cake form and is exquisite...beyond words can describe!!!! Tried kinder and cadbury ones and all guests were impressed!
Granita and milkshake: AMAZING! I'm not a fan of strawberry however their strawberry granita tastes like genuine strawberries! Milkshakes made of blended ice cream scoops of your choice are creamy yum!
Most recent discovery....CANNOLIS!!! Oh...my...God! The best cannoli I've ever tried by a long shot! Whole crunchy pistachios at the ends, sugary ricotta and a crunchy cannoli shell...like no other!

Bottom line: this place has ruined every other gelateria for me, as no other ice cream on the island..or in other countries I've visited compare to this place! If you seek homemade goodness that will send your taste buds to Heaven and back, you cannot even dream of missing out on this place!!! FANTASTIC",Date of visit: August 2018,Sottozero the Gelato Factory,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Ok now I'm getting obsessed....,"Decided to leave yet another review about this amazing establishment after visiting for the fourth and fifth time.
The fourth time: Carbonara burger and Lindt pancake
The fifth time: Cow and Chicken burger and Galaxy Caramel pancake

The Carbonara burger was BY FAR the best burger in existence!! It's genuinely like eating carbonara pasta in a juicy succulent burger! Not to mention the creamy egg, lovely guanciale and also a thick piece of fine grana padano cheese. Wow!!!!
The lindt pancake was also very good and presented exquisitely
The Cow and Chicken burger was HUGEE! Burger was juicy and chicken pieces amazing!
As for the galaxy caramel pancake....OH MY GOD!it was honestly like a taste of Heaven with every single bite....pleaseeee YOU CAN'T MISS THIS!!!!

anyways, this place always impresses me and is the place where I want to get married and get buried (seriously)

Special thanks to chef and owner Daniel and waitress Danika!",Date of visit: August 2018,Shoreditch Bar & Kitchen,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Wow!! Wasn't expecting this!,"Finally visited after tons of good reviews and recommendations from friends. Opted for a Maxibon waffle with extra Hersheys and nutella and also a Thirsty cow shake (with oreos)
The shake was immensely delicious and went down very well! As for the waffle, I usually dont like waffles that much so was sceptical whether this would impress me. However, I can safely say that this was the BEST waffle I'd ever tasted! The waffle itself was thick and crunchy, chocolate and nuts complimented perfectly and helped the Maxibon ice cream to melt delicately over the whole dessert.
The only thing is, the items werw a tad pricey - paid over 12 euro for both items. However will definitely return to try more waffles and shakes!
A+++++++",Date of visit: July 2018,Thirsty Cow,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Impeccable cuisine!,"Visited for the second time for a family birthday lunch.
First time had the Jack Daniels ribs which were so perfect and among the best I've ever had (being a rib-aholic,I've tasted plenty), I was lookibg forward to revisiting.
This time opted for their octopus .the portion was HUGE and it was without a doubt the best I have ever had.
Service was a tad slow this time round. Staff did not bring bread or cutlery when we were cutting the cake. However all in all this is one of my favourite restaurants in Malta!
Will try their famous pasta next time",Date of visit: July 2018,Uncle Matt's Kitchen,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Very lovely ambiance and very genuine and good food,"Visited this establishment three times. All were exceptional!
However we wanted to visit again due to change of ownership to see if it retained its 5 star status
Opted for rabbit in gravy and horsemeat on one dish. Horsemeat could have been served hotter, but was delicious and had great gravy!
Rabbit was BY FAR the best I've ever had!gravy was succulent and salty, ate a lot of bread with it!!
Very nice chips and roast veg served on the side, so food was not only divine,but delicious!
Price is very good considering great service, fabulous dishes and amazing ambiance. Feels like a fine dining restaurant with an affordable price!
Highly recommended!",Date of visit: July 2018,Maestrale Gourmet,1,"Island of Gozo, Malta"
Pricy but good,"Very nice view and good amount of choices on menu
Muffin was large. Good but nothing special
Freakshakes were presented nicely with over 50 flavours to choose from, served with a doughnut and kinder egg. But for 6.50 euro per shake, they weren't very big
Will visit again to try snacks :)",Date of visit: July 2018,Sea View Bar,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Never been served,"Very disappointed with this establishment. We always wanted ro visit after seeing great reviews .
First time went at around 4.30 and told us they were closing

Great snacks!!,"Been wanting to visit this food truck for ages,never had the chance since it doesn't open on weekends.
Went on a Friday and opted for their renowned pulled pork bun
This was by far the best pork bun I'd ever tasted! Generous with the meat, delicious fried onions and cabbage
Highly recommended!!!",Date of visit: June 2018,EAT,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
5 stars are NOT ENOUGH for this place!,"Visited for the third time after falling in love with their burgers and pancakes with a goal to keep trying a lot of their food items from a wide variety on their menu! They keep adding new burgers and pancakes on the menu, which is fantastic!

This time round, opted for the speciality burnt duck burger. This was huge! Meat was cooked to perfection, tender and pink in the middle! Thin cut fries delicious and coleslaw not overpowering! Burger hit the spot!

For dessert my boyfriend and I took Reese cups pancake and kinder pingui pancake and shared both. Reese was good but kinder pingui was OUT OF THIS WORLD! when I took a bite out of it, I was about to die with astonishment. The taste was bewilderingly good!

To top it off, service was also perfect and prices very reasonable!
Bottom line, if you haven't yet visited this establishment, you are missing out big time!!

"Amazing view, good food and service!","We visited here one night during our stay in Istanbul. We opted to stay on the rooftop where we had an outstanding view of the Blue Mosque.
We opted to share a meat pide and also ordered manti (ravioli) and a meat stew. Food was very good,even though the manti were not to my liking, a bit heavy on the sour cream, but I suppose that's the traditional way of cooking them. All in all, we really enjoyed our visit! Service was also very good and attentive!",Date of visit: May 2018,The Terrace Restaurant cafe,1,"Istanbul, Turkey"
Best restaurant we've been at Istanbul!!,"My mum and I ate here three times out of seven days we were at Istanbul!
First night we opted for hamsi fish starter and a mixed grill for 2. Second night we chose the mixed fish grill for 2 and the final night we returned for that amazing and mouth watering mixed grill meat platter for 2!!!
Food is plentiful, ambiance is relaxing and welcoming and service is very attentive!all waiters became friends with us and we were given complimentary baklava and tea after dinner.
Slightly pricier than other restaurants (approx 40 euro/200TL between 2 people) but definitely worth it!!",Date of visit: May 2018,Saltanat Fish & Kebab House,1,"Istanbul, Turkey"
Definitely coming back!!,"Visited Istanbul for the first time and stayed at this gem. It had the complete package! Great decor and ambiance, clean rooms and amazing service! All members of staff are super sweet and helpful! Room was small but comfortable and equipped with all necessities! They give you free water upon arrival
They also offer a transport card which can be used by up to 5 people. Make sure to ask for it!
Location is EXCELLENT! one road up you find the tram and metro. Also very central area,walking distance to main attractions!
Breakfast is by far the best I've ever experienced at a hotel! Choices are abundant: various types of bread, eggs, cereals, cold cuts, various cheeses and cakes and cookies ...what I loved most..
Typical Turkish food items!!! Like halva (amazing), cheese-filled pastry, grilled veg with sour cream, Turkish cake, Turkish tea and more!
Also a small fitness room and sauna downstairs. We felt spoilt like Queens!
Tipped them 80TL (15 euros) as we really enjoyed our stay!
Highly recommended!!!",Date of stay: May 2018,Enderun Hotel Istanbul,1,"Istanbul, Turkey"
Good food and atmosphere,"Visited this establishment as a large group. We had a set menu which was quite varied
Starters included pasta with wild boar ragu, mixed fish fritters, a heated Maltese loaf with goat cheese, burrata, arancini and fried large meatballs. Especially enjoyed the heated bread, burrata and meatballs!
For main course I opted for duck breast with a honey glaze sauce, plated alongside a roasted butternut squash and a 'potato cake'
I usually rarely eat duck but I must say this dish was Gordon Ramsey worthy!
Duck was exquisitely cooked, honey sauce so good I devoured bread with it! And oh my God... what on earth was that potato cake?! It was one of the most divine things I had ever eaten! Layers of succulent potato embellished with creamy cheese in between! Wow!!!
For dessert opted for a millefoglie - layers of crispy sweet dough filled with white chocolate in one layer and with milk chocolate in another. Served with peanut ice cream. Also very good
All in all,I am glad I visited this restaurant. Good food, view and service!

"Creative and messy, but delicious milkshakes!","After all the hype about these milkshakes, my boyfriend and I decided to pay this place a visit at Tigne Point in Sliema.
We opted for nutella and kinder milkshakes.
A+ for decoration and aesthetic appeal! They look divine with several chocolate goodies related to the flavour you choose. Very messy, my hair ate some of it also haha!
Taste was very good, even though a tad overpriced at 6.50 per shake

Managed to convert me to a Neapolitan pizza lover!!,"Being a person who loves a thick pizza crust and abundant toppings on a pizza, I have never been a fan of Italian style pizzas with thin crusts and few toppings. However, after being recommended by a few friends of mine, I decided to try this hidden pizza place located in our lovely capital
We arrived an hour before our booking as we were ravenous, hoping they would accept us despite our early arrival. We were greeted by very friendly waiting staff and told it was no problem.
We were served tiny fresh bruschetta. Then, about 8 minutes after ordering the pizzas arrived! Talk about fast service!
My mum opted for pizza patate e salsiccia (potatoes and sausage) while I opted for their famous carbonara pizza
Pizza was one of the BEST I've ever had in my life!!!! True, crust is thin and light but the taste and quality is beyond SUBLIME!
Atmosphere is very cosy, service gentle and quick, food impeccable and prices are very good given the quality!
Will definitely visit again!",Date of visit: April 2018,Sotto Pizzeria,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Made mistakes but they made up for them!!,"Visited this gem for the second time on a very busy Saturday night.
At first we were a bit annoyed. We had a reservation at 8.30 and were told to wait to be seated. We were finally seated after 15 minutes. Then, it took the staff 45 minutes to take our order!!
However, his must have been due to some shortage of waiting staff as, after food arrived, it was exceptional!
My boyfriend opted for a fillet and I opted for a rabbit spaghetti. The rabbit pasta was HUGE and consisted of many pieces of rabbit as well as rabbit liver which I requested. The fillet was tender and tasteful. What is more, due to the long waiting time, every member of staff came to check on us and also gave us complimentary drinks (any drink we desired).
Highly recommended!!!!",Date of visit: April 2018,Qbajjar Restaurant,1,"Island of Gozo, Malta"
Astounding view and amazing food!,"My boyfriend and I visited on our anniversary. We were seated outside, with an incredible breathtaking view of the Gozo harbour, with Malta visibly showing in the horizon. The view alone is an enough reason to visit this gem!
Then came the food: a gorgeous fillet of beef and spare ribs. The spare ribs were to die for, barely any fat on them and so tender you can use a fork to simply get the meat off the bone. The food is also VERY well priced and service is also very good!

2nd time and I'm in love!!!,"Visited for the second time after a fantastic experience the first time.
Last time had taken Jameson burger, this time opted for braised beef rib speciality burger
Last time for dessert, opted for a kinder pancake and a Hersheys pancake while this time took the speciality cannoli pancake
After the first visit being such a perfect dining experience, I was looking forward for the second visit
And i can say with full confidence that it was SUBLIME once again!!
Burger had a very delicious peppercorn sauce and the beef was delicately cooked and top notch
The pancake was indescribable. Milk and white chocolate sauce with yummy cannoli and stacked with 4 divine pancakes. Words cannot describe this place!!!!",Date of visit: April 2018,Shoreditch Bar & Kitchen,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
WOWWW!!!!,"Visited this establishment on a very busy Easter Sunday. We were a group of 9 people and immediately upon arrival, we were greeted and taken care of with the utmost care!
Ordered a variety of dishes - from pizza, burgers, pasta, octopus and ribs. I tasted all and EVERYTHING was SUPERB!
my dish was the rack of ribs with Jack Daniels sauce....I must say they were divine, so tender and exquisite! Also very generous portions and reasonable prices!
The service was impeccable from start to finish! My thought is, if they are capable of delivering such a perfect experience on a fully booked holiday, imagine how they treat their customers on a regular day!!!

Third time's a charm!,"On previous occasions,visited Hard rock cafe for burgers. Burgers were always mediocre in my opinion,when compared to their prices
However yesterday opted for the BBQ mix containing ribs and pulled pork. The meat was slow cooked to perfection,so tender!!!fried onions on pulled pork were delicious, cowboy beans, fries and sauce were all perfect! Then shared their delicious hot brownie for dessert which was to die for!
Service quick, prices a tad high especially cocktails. However the ribs and meat was perfect. A very good experience!",Date of visit: March 2018,Hard Rock Cafe,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Unique taste of traditional cuisine!,"This hidden gem in our lovely capital provides ONLY Maltese dishes, drinks, wines, desserts. Authentic Maltese dishes and an extensive menu!

Just not my type,"This place is renowned for having exquisite Napolitan style pizzas
After a huge recommendation from a friend, we went there as a group of 10.
The pizzas were thin, Italian style. Many to choose from
Opted for Big Paolo which was listed as having double blue cheese and double mozzarella. However there was hardly any cheese at all.
Pizza was purposefully soggy. I personally did not enjoy it even though my friends liked their pizza.
We also felt it didn't satsify our appetite as it was not very large, however I think this is a matter of taste. Also a tad overpriced",Date of visit: January 2018,Made in Sud,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
A meal to remember!!,"Came here after multiple attempts
They won't take bookings for two so to book you need to be a small group at least, and the place is very small so be sure to book in advance
Opted for a 300g Jameson burger with cheesy fries. The burger was perfectly cooked and huge! Tender meat and plentiful! Then opted for the kinder pancake which was divine. Enjoyed dessert so much that I took another pancake,this time Hersheys. This one was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!
great service and reasonable prices

"Very good, small Maltese eatery!","This restaurant is one of many in Mgarr that serve traditional Maltese dishes, ranging from rabbit to horsemeat to snails
My boyfriend and I reserved at the last minute and so were welcomed but warned that we had to leave by 9pm. The restaurant is very small, bearing only a few tables so be sure to book beforehand
Service is good and waitresses friendly. Could have been a bit faster, especially with such a small restaurant and few tables, however we were very satisfied
We opted for whole rabbit which serves 2-3 persons, cooked in gravy. The rabbit was succulent and gravy was so exquisite that we devoured a whole Maltese loaf of bread with it! Bread was crunchy and chips were also plentiful and delicious.
We were given complimentary Maltese bread with beans and kunserva on top and also Helwa tat- Tork afterwards.
Bill amounted to 39 euro, including a bottle of Rose local wine and a pepsi. Very good value for money! Recommended!",Date of visit: February 2018,Ta' L-Ingliz,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"

Then came the food: a gorgeous fillet of beef and spare ribs. The spare ribs were to die for, barely any fat on them and so tender you can use a fork to simply get the meat off the bone. The food is also VERY well priced and service is also very good!

2nd time and I'm in love!!!,"Visited for the second time after a fantastic experience the first time.
Last time had taken Jameson burger, this time opted for braised beef rib speciality burger
Last time for dessert, opted for a kinder pancake and a Hersheys pancake while this time took the speciality cannoli pancake
After the first visit being such a perfect dining experience, I was looking forward for the second visit
And i can say with full confidence that it was SUBLIME once again!!
Burger had a very delicious peppercorn sauce and the beef was delicately cooked and top notch
The pancake was indescribable. Milk and white chocolate sauce with yummy cannoli and stacked with 4 divine pancakes. Words cannot describe this place!!!!",Date of visit: April 2018,Shoreditch Bar & Kitchen,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
WOWWW!!!!,"Visited this establishment on a very busy Easter Sunday. We were a group of 9 people and immediately upon arrival, we were greeted and taken care of with the utmost care!
Ordered a variety of dishes - from pizza, burgers, pasta, octopus and ribs. I tasted all and EVERYTHING was SUPERB!
my dish was the rack of ribs with Jack Daniels sauce....I must say they were divine, so tender and exquisite! Also very generous portions and reasonable prices!
The service was impeccable from start to finish! My thought is, if they are capable of delivering such a perfect experience on a fully booked holiday, imagine how they treat their customers on a regular day!!!
This has been an unforgettable dining experience, seated opposite the picturesque Marsascala seafront with AMAZING food and service.
One of my favourites!has been ranked at the top of my list!",Date of visit: April 2018,Uncle Matt's Kitchen,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Third time's a charm!,"On previous occasions,visited Hard rock cafe for burgers. Burgers were always mediocre in my opinion,when compared to their prices
However yesterday opted for the BBQ mix containing ribs and pulled pork. The meat was slow cooked to perfection,so tender!!!fried onions on pulled pork were delicious, cowboy beans, fries and sauce were all perfect! Then shared their delicious hot brownie for dessert which was to die for!
Service quick, prices a tad high especially cocktails. However the ribs and meat was perfect. A very good experience!",Date of visit: March 2018,Hard Rock Cafe,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Unique taste of traditional cuisine!,"This hidden gem in our lovely capital provides ONLY Maltese dishes, drinks, wines, desserts. Authentic Maltese dishes and an extensive menu!
No cola here, just kinnie and 7Up and only true Maltese cuisine
Try the horse meat served in a delicious crispy Maltese loaf served with mouth watering baked potatoes and veggies. Very big portions!
Next time will try the ftiras and rabbit ravioli
Service quick and polite,even though perhaps employing Maltese staff would make the experience even more authentic :)
Highly recommended!",Date of visit: February 2018,Nenu the Artisan Baker,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Just not my type,"This place is renowned for having exquisite Napolitan style pizzas
After a huge recommendation from a friend, we went there as a group of 10.
The pizzas were thin, Italian style. Many to choose from
Opted for Big Paolo which was listed as having double blue cheese and double mozzarella. However there was hardly any cheese at all.
Pizza was purposefully soggy. I personally did not enjoy it even though my friends liked their pizza.
We also felt it didn't satsify our appetite as it was not very large, however I think this is a matter of taste. Also a tad overpriced",Date of visit: January 2018,Made in Sud,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
A meal to remember!!,"Came here after multiple attempts
They won't take bookings for two so to book you need to be a small group at least, and the place is very small so be sure to book in advance
Opted for a 300g Jameson burger with cheesy fries. The burger was perfectly cooked and huge! Tender meat and plentiful! Then opted for the kinder pancake which was divine. Enjoyed dessert so much that I took another pancake,this time Hersheys. This one was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!
great service and reasonable prices
You MUST try this restaurant. It is simply one of a kind and we will surely be back!",Date of visit: February 2018,Shoreditch Bar & Kitchen,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
"Very good, small Maltese eatery!","This restaurant is one of many in Mgarr that serve traditional Maltese dishes, ranging from rabbit to horsemeat to snails
My boyfriend and I reserved at the last minute and so were welcomed but warned that we had to leave by 9pm. The restaurant is very small, bearing only a few tables so be sure to book beforehand
Service is good and waitresses friendly. Could have been a bit faster, especially with such a small restaurant and few tables, however we were very satisfied
We opted for whole rabbit which serves 2-3 persons, cooked in gravy. The rabbit was succulent and gravy was so exquisite that we devoured a whole Maltese loaf of bread with it! Bread was crunchy and chips were also plentiful and delicious.
We were given complimentary Maltese bread with beans and kunserva on top and also Helwa tat- Tork afterwards.
Bill amounted to 39 euro, including a bottle of Rose local wine and a pepsi. Very good value for money! Recommended!",Date of visit: February 2018,Ta' L-Ingliz,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Amazing pizza,"Ordered takeaway pizza after my boyfriend recommended it. It was to die for! Huge and loaded with toppings. Crust was exquisite and very reasonable price!
Highly recommended!!",Date of visit: January 2018,Bay Leaves,1,"Island of Malta, Malta"
