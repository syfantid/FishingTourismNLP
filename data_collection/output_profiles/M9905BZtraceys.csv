Our 3rd visit,"What a beautiful relaxing holiday yet again, we can't fault this hotel. Our 1st year here was for 7 nights, last year we stayed for 11 & we've just got home from 14 nights. Our room was immaculate, fresh sheets & towels as always. There is a mixture of ages, young & mature. We hired a car for 3 days to see the island & the Dimitrios & Efthimia fishing cruise is a must. Many thanks to the hard working, friendly staff & owners.",Date of stay: August 2019,Magnolia Resort,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"

5 Star food,"This is a family run business & it's food is delicious, they are welcoming & friendly & hard working. We love the gyros, home made fries & courgette balls to name a few.
