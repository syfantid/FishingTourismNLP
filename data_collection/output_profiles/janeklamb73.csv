Best day EVER!,"Just returned from the most magical day at sea with Captain Nikos, his wonderful wife Frossa and the legend who catches the fish, Simos.

I never write reviews, but felt compelled to share the pure joy we all experienced today. This is a traditional fishing boat, so you get to see the fish being caught in the nets, but our children (12 and 9) also both caught fish using rods too. Very excited!

We ate wonderful freshly cooked food, washed down with beer and wine (All drinks included). To top it all, we swam in the most stunning turquoise water all day. A perfect, relaxed and joyous experience.

A truly memorable day...I can not recommend it highly enough.

Huge thanks from us all,
