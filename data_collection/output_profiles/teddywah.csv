The grit in the oyster,"Lovely views from this restaurant, service poor, food was underwhelming, made to feel undervalued as a customer as dining with children, all in all we were churned and burnt.
There are several other restaurants in the bay, look elsewhere for pearls.

Picture perfect bay on outskirts of Genoa,"Beautiful bay, relaxed chill atmosphere. Stylish and sophisticated enclave of Genoa. a must see to escape the hustle and bustle of Genoa",Date of experience: August 2018,Boccadasse,1,"Genoa, Italy"
Tired shadow of a glorious past,"Nice hotel on outskirts of centro.
Easy walk to most tourist areas, as only 20 mins from Ponte Vecchio. This Hotel would have once been fabulous, a little tired now, could do with reinvestment.
Although we are told parking is £22 per day and the use of the swimming pool an extra £2.50 per person, it still leaves you feeling ""milked "" and under appreciated as a guest.
Far better to include the pool and add £2.50 to room rates. It does leave a bad taste in your mouth, breakfast however does not and if a welcome and tasty delight.",Date of stay: August 2018,Villa Royal,1,"Florence, Italy"
Hidden Gem,"Wonderful backstreet setting, Local dining at its best.
Knowledgeable front of house staff, excellent chefs. Moderately Priced.

Treasure uncovered.....,"Beautiful restaurant in an authentic Italian fishing village. Food was amazing, we savored every mouthful. On par with some fine dining we have experience and better than most mid ranged restaurants.
Only con was the lack of outside seating, Grilled octopus, seafood soup and sardines standout dishes",Date of visit: August 2018,Creuza de ma,1,"Genoa, Italy"
Kitchen let down by front of house,"Food was amazing, pushing on an open door for a star, But like Fraiche in Oxton the experience let down by front of house staff.

The best family fun we had in Rhodes..........,"Travelling as a family, generally its difficult to find activities a couple and Girls would be happy to do. despite early reservations (would girls be ok with the fishing) we embarked on our trip and had a most wonderful experience.
Captain Vassilli and his co pilot Mark were excellent and basically taught us all to fish, They showed great patience and skill with our 10 year old who initially found the sport alien, however she went on to catch 5 good fish... and thoroughly enjoyed her day. to a man we all agreed this was a holiday highlight.
Food was fabulous and included some of our catch... well done Makarounas Fishing Trip. Highly recommended.",Date of experience: August 2017,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Kids Club or Kidnap Club?,"The title may seem a little alarming, but if you are travelling with children, it is relevant please read on.......

Firstly , may I say we have enjoyed the Holiday Inn Resort on 5 occasions over 15 years. We specifically choose this Resort due to its location and Kids Club, and in the past the service from staff and facilities have been exemplary. If we did not have children we would definitely return, as to stigmatize a whole hotel for the actions of one absent staff member if not our aim.

We travelled through Asia in April 2017 ending our journey in Patong, Phuket.

On our second night in Holiday Inn Resort we booked our Children into the Kids Club, During their 2 hour stay whilst we went for Dinner the children were abandoned by Jina the kids club representative for what they said was 25 Minutes. Now 25 minutes is barely enough time to cook a pizza, but it is a long time to leave Guests children alone in an unlocked, unmanned child care facility, within 1 minute from 3 pools and 2 main roads.

We were phoned by our children to say they were alone and we returned to pick them up. Whilst the children were alone, the youngest 4 years old, another parent returned her child to Kids Club, but refused to leave them as there was no supervisory staff.
Consequently we collected children and contacted Guest relations.
Guest relation Manager apologised for her staffs Negligence (her word not Mine) and left a basket of insult inducing chocolates in our room the following day, I returned them to reception and asked to be contacted by senior Management.

As seasoned travellers we are able to forgive small, sometimes medium sized mistakes, a little food poisoning here, a dirty towel there etc, but when the only duty of the kids Club staff is to look after your children, and they leave 5 kids alone in an unlocked kids club we thought we should bring this to peoples attention.

I met with The General Manager, whom assured me the staff were hauled over the coals, however Jina was back in work the following day without a care in the world.
The Manager acknowledged the token chocolates did nothing but add insult to injury, and offered us a ride to the airport............. we declined. Mr Bart Callens the general manager checked the cctv tapes and admitted Jina had abandoned her post for ONLY 13 minutes, this was never confirmed and we really didn't care, 2 minutes would have been way too long.

I have never before seen such impotent management. If your hotel reputation as a top 10 family resort, rests with an absent, negligent childminder, the management needs to take decisive and swift action. The safety and security of guest and more importantly their children should be paramount.",Date of stay: April 2017,Holiday Inn Resort Phuket,1,"Phuket, Thailand"
"Happiness in PP Central, clean, excellent service and facilities","Since a full recent programme of modernisation, PP Charlie has become a fantastic little resort, small enough to be personal but big enough not to feel crowded.

"Wonderful Food, woeful service","We were recommended this restaurant by friends and so paid a visit in June.

The main outside tables were all taken so we opted to stay and eat at the less atmospheric rear of the restaurant. Unfortunately the service here was woeful. Had we not been with the children and needed them to be fed I would not have stayed. The waitress was the least charismatic person we met on vacation. Even grumpier than Parisian taxi drivers in the recent floods. She tutted, coughed and spluttered through our order, then went missing whilst cheerily serving French speaking customers. Pure Faulty towers.

We waited over an hour for starters. Its just not adequate.

The restaurant is worth a visit, as the food is fine so long as you get a smiling waitress, if the service is forced or offhand run to the nearest restaurant were your custom may be more appreciated. At £60 per head you should feel valued as a customer..............",Date of visit: June 2016,La Mediterranee,1,"Mougins, France"

Small Intimate food heaven.............,"We arrived at this restaurant by chance and was a large party of 7, as we had not booked we waited for only 5 minutes for a table to be prepared. Service and atmosphere was wonderful and the 5 minutes gave us a chance to see some of the other wonderful dishes served to fellow customers.

Usual spanish style small plates and stalwart mains but prepared beautifully.

An excellent and authentic spanish dining experience.

"Smack , bang in the center of the village","We went to the Ca'n Moixet several times during April. We visited with friends who recommended the restaurant for the good value choice and service. We were not disappointed.

Great for Breakfast and light lunch Drinks on the front terrace on a sunday during the market also a must. excellent free wifi and great value. Not really a place for a romantic dinner but the food is excellent anyway.",Date of visit: April 2016,Ca'n Moixet,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Beautiful setting in a wonderful town.,"late april dinner at the Osteria 15, the restaurant seemed to be coming out of a slumber after the winter, couple of meals were missing from the order and one of the meals arrived cold. these were deleted from the bill but mentioned to be thorough.

Food quality other than this was above average on this square. things should tighten up as the season progresses.

all in all a good dining experience.",Date of visit: April 2016,Osteria N15,1,"Majorca, Spain"

The best of the 3 Rodizio restaurants in Liverpool,"Fazenda, is by far the best South American rodizio style restaurant in Liverpool.
Quality and service and of food is excellent with the exception of the booking experience. Sometimes I have had to phone up to 4 times to get an answer, and once booking a masterclass evening had to physically drive to the restaurant to reserve a table. Email bookings are rather hit and miss also. Once in the restaurant, you can wait upto 30 mins after your booking time to be seated, however we were compensated with a free drink at the table. Ambience of the dining rooms are very good, decor and cleanliness are exceptional, and presentation of food is exemplary.

All the meats on offer were cooked well and were not too lean, Good steak requires some fat for the enhancement of flavours.

The restaurant is only let down by the front of house booking experience., otherwise an entertaining evening of good food and great atmosphere.",Date of visit: August 2015,Fazenda Rodizio Bar and Grill,1,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"
Perfect urban style,"Rooms are clean and modern, there is attention to every detail in the hotel.
Fantastic bar area with decent prices and weekly offers. Convenient location for metro and wider Brussels.

Kind of a hotel / hostel hybrid. breakfasts a bit shabby but cheap and plentiful.

Best location for all costa teguise can offer.,"Costa teguise, is a beautiful area, well served with restaurants and bar and slightly more refined and upmarket to its sister resorts.
The hotel sits directly on the beach, which has golden sands and a sheltered lagoon.

Service and food at the hotel was good,The hotel seems to be in the middle of a series of renovations of some more tired areas, but overall the hotel ran efficiently. We had a room in the older section of hotel, it was clean but tired. views from room were excellent.

Drinks were plentiful, although the more premium brands of spirit was missing or supplied at extra cost. Food was varied and of a good standard, far better than expected. The pool area was very clean and well maintained.
Sun loungers were plentiful and animation team very good with children.

Evening entertainment was better than average. But plenty of bars and restaurants less than 5 mins walk away. so spoilt for choice.

Slight gripe, we had to pay extra for the safe deposit box, in a 4 star hotel this should be complimentary, as should wifi as were out of the stone age.

All in all an agreeable hotel.",Date of stay: July 2015,Hotel Grand Teguise Playa,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"

Selection of food was excellent as was the service and presentation. Great selection of local Lanzarote wines and were not disappointed.

Paradise found........,"From your arrival to your sad departure, you are immersed into the best service and comfort you could wish for.

Arriving at the resort is via inclusive speedboat transfer, lottery millionaire style. and well worth the booking price alone, once cocooned on the island your a world away from the bustle of Phuket and onto your own perfect paradise.

67 individual villas with golf buggy taxi service glides you around the island. numerous watersports are available for the more energetic, and the best pools and views for those not so energetic.

Villas are of a thai balinese style with private pools and outdoor bath and shower facilities as well as an enclosed dining room for air conned enjoyment. Outdoor dining areas are also on hand for a truly private stay.

Drinks and food was not too expensive, but more than compensated for by the excellent breakfasts and food and service quality.

The head chef had just won Australian iron chef so was more than qualified to prepare breathtaking local and international dishes. Bravo........

Spa and ice room facilities were second to none, and when one member of our group felt unwell the island nurse was on hand to dispense care and medication immediately.

Incidentally I left all of our passports and £900 in the safe after we checked out. this was returned to our next hotel by the staff at Naka within 2 hours!",Date of stay: April 2015,"The Naka Island, A Luxury Collection Resort & Spa Phuket",1,"Phuket, Thailand"

It's OK.....,"Have been 3 times now, and it started as a wonderful niche restaurant , but descended into complacency. The drinks are beautifully crafted but expensive, Asking for little or no ice was ignored, and at £7 a cocktail, that's quite a shock!
The food is good, but the portions are somewhat, small. I kept thinking of what I could eat from the fridge once I got home.

"""Churn em and burn em"" Sarris take your eye off the till and train your staff.....","The restaurant and the overbearing waiters promise so much but deliver so little. The food was tasteless and portions tiny, The meze for 2 would not have fed our children, we had to order 2 adult meals for a 8 and 10 year old! The food in our all inclusive hotel was of a much higher standard. If your looking for a special place to eat this looks nice but is terrible. Save your money and head to ANYONE ELSE!
If you work hard for your money respect yourself and avoid this place. The food is at best mediocre, the service is awful. We wasted a night out here on overpriced poor quality rubbish served by journeymen waiters , don't be fooled.........",Date of visit: September 2014,Tavern Sarris,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
EXCELLENT,"So good we went twice....
They charge entrance for adults at 2 Euro but do not charge for the sun loungers, the Bay is fabulous and safe for swimming , so much so dive schools hold introductory dives here.
The food is amazing, some of the best salads in a country renowned for its food. Inventive and above all fresh. table service is available fro your sunloungers and the service is fantastic.

The hotel is really nice not a 5 star but a good 3* with 4* staff and food.
As with the best hotels the staff are the difference and in all areas they were exceptional. Rooms however could do with an update to bring them to 4* standard. Food was better than local restaurants and the inclusive drinks were quality spirits. Jamesons , Ballantine's, jim beam and absolute etc

Excellent choice on the menu and no hassle staff.

We enjoyed our visit so much we returned on our last night, not our usual routine to return to a restaurant however our experience was so good It warranted a last night celebration meal. As ever the Staff made us all very welcome and were excellent with all parties of our group.

If we had read some of the reviews we may never have visited, but now we have I can tell you this restaurant is fabulous. The time to complain about prices is before you have ordered not after you have eaten without checking prices.

Average in a city of excellence.........,"We stayed in the Swiss-Garden Hotel & Residences, in August. the rooms are immaculate and very spacious, the design is also modern and clean. We stayed for 3 nights enroute to Bali and chose this hotel in preference to our usual Hotel in KL the Pan pacific Regency for a change. Incidently we booked the Pan Pacific on the way back!!

the Pool and Gym area were excellent, As was the food in the restaurant in the evening. Location is a great selling point for this hotel, barely 10 mins from the lively Changkat / bukit bintang Centre.
The only issues we had was with the Breakfasts , which were poor in comparison with most other hotels of this class and some of the other guests. When you book a suite at this pricepoint you get great value , however some of the other guests working to tight budgets are more Football shirt wearing than Polo shirt wearing, I know this sounds arrogant but I had a few conversations with the staff, who raised eyebrows at some of the ruder middle-eastern guests, Pushing into breakfast queues quite a lot of spitting and generally behaviour I would chastise my children for, although this is not the fault of the hotel and their hard working staff, it does diminish the enjoyment of your stay.",Date of stay: August 2013,The Residences @ Swiss-Garden Hotel & Residences Kuala Lumpur,1,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"
Excellence in Paridise,"We returned to the Novotel Bali Benoa, after 11 years having honeymooned there in 2002.
We were not disappointed, the hotel is still stunning, the surrounding area more lively yet still retaining a local flavour.

The beach is immaculate and ""raked daily"" and the beach has a gental slope into the sea suitable for children, beach bar and watersports facilities are excellent.
Communal areas are spotless , staff helpful and happy, and the food was outstanding. A completely happy holiday, and my children's new favourite hotel...

The only issue we had was the size of the rooms, we booked though an internet company and were surprised the hotel listed the deluxe room as adequate for 2 adults and 2 children. With a sofa bed up and the fold away bed up as well there is no floor space in the room. I contacted reception and was told Guests children normally sleep in with the parents. So if travelling with children be prepared to upgrade $$$ or share the big bed!!

"tale of 2 cities, dont assume you get any ammenities","We booked a garden room and it was terrible.... as soon as we entered the room we were demoralised and upset. Spoke to the night manager who claimed to be fully booked, when he tried to sell tours to me etc he asked what my plans were for the following day, ""looking for a better hotel"" wasn't what he was expecting. The rooms were dark and dingy, bathroom facilities included a sanitary towel bag and shower cap, neither of which I needed and shower soap which was half empty, now I know hotels often refill these bottles but leaving them half empty does remind you the last guest has only just left....
There was no TV !!! No Mini bar and no fridge, the swimming pool was open to the public on payment of a fee and general upkeep was lacklustre. This may be ok for sandal wearing , hippie potters but I expect $100 hotels to have glass in all windows and a TV.

After another moan the following morning the overworked night manager showed us another room which was more suitable this was next to the restaurant, but had some of the modern appliences which make a stay more comfortable...

Breakfast was very good, but even when booking as a family of 4 you only have 2 breakfasts included!!! something I found very cheap! we spent most of our time out of the hotel, but the staff did try their hardest, it really is just the hotel itself needs a good shake up.....

Good 4 star turkish hotel ...... which means excellent 3 star in the real world!,"Booked online as a family of 4. The Hotel Antea must specialise in Dwarf travellers,
was given a room with a double and a single room.... way too small so we just stayed out most of the day. Tried changing rooms but was met with wall of smiles and no help. Couldn't wait to get out of hotel after breakfast, and didn't look forward to returning to the small cramped , clean, cell like rooms with limited tv choice in the evening.
The view from the room was of a brick wall. Bathroom very good and water temperature bordering on nuclear!

No English tv, save the news but that's always depressing so nothing to do in the evening at the hotel, if you have kids you know how rubbish this can be. did try the spa but there are no windows or natural light so that's depressing too.... even the kids didn't want to stay in the pool which is a first!

Communal areas were exceptionally clean as was the breakfast room.

Frequented by students without too great a knowledge of chinese food and office workers grabbing cheap lunches. Highlights include the noodle soup, lowlights No chinese tea, even though they have the cups and tea urn to make it, this forces you to buy the flat coke or other soft drinks which dont compliment the food.

You cannot put a candle in a turd and call it a birthday cake!,"Reviews are difficult to judge as it depends on the writers thresholds..... what your used to and will tolerate! We travelled to sharm on August 21st, for 2 weeks booking this ""5 star"" hotel as a bit of a treat, we had previously visited Sharm on 2 occassions and had had a wonderfull holidays, we expected much of the same!!! This is a 3 star hotel with 1 star clenliness and service.
This Hotel is filthy, the staff are browbeaten from constant complaints from the guests and the management have no interest in the happiness and safety of its guests. When our rep was informed of our intention to move hotels at our own expense he claimed we had been the second family that morning to apply to be moved, when the Guest manager of the hotel came to hear our grievences he told us not to eat in the main resturants but only to eat at the ""all seasons"" resturant by the pool. So when i asked if he expected us to eat all our meals in 1 resturant when the hotel advertises 5 resturants he claimed we would be happier!

Excuses came thick and fast and included; we were guests during a local festival, the local arabs were holidaying at the same time and were very dirty, this explained the mound of used toilet paper overflowing the bins in the toilets...... one can only assume the local festival was the national cleaners strike week!

Place mats in the filthy dining room had evidence of the previous meals dried food.. and the floors were covered in spilt drinks and paper towels, staff just hung around oogling young russians and talking on mobile phones, none of them wore uniforms so you didnt know if they were staff or not. Even the russians were complaining and other guests informed us they had been fighting between themselves the week before. To cap a ""5 star"" dining experience, drinks served in plastic cups or chipped glasses. Nobody smiled

The real shame of this hotel is that it could be good but isnt!
Management are self important and indifferent, general staff are powerless and bullied.

We left after 2 days as the thought of eating in this sewer would make us all ill, if your travelling with children you have a duty to ensure there safety, we did not feel we could in this hotel.

As an example of how we coped, whilst waiting for our new accomodation to be confirmed, the only place to eat was the pool snack bar, where food was served up onto polystyrine plates with the chefs fingers.... knowing the toilet habits of arabic nations it was still prefferable than eating in the main resturants.

We moved to the Jolie ville penninsula and enjoyed our remaining holiday....",Date of stay: August 2012,Continental Plaza Beach Resort,1,"Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt"
simply great value...,"Travelled to egypt 5 times now Jolie ville was a transfer from our booked hotel, which was substandard.
Jolie ville peninsula was a very enjoyable hotel, rooms are huge and well appointed, Food was fine, only one case of the trotts which in Egypt is a let off! Pool area is large and the animation team were ok. The evenings entertainment is very poor with the exception of the magician.
Staff seem happy to help and are clean , courtious and knowledgeable.
Only downside is the fact you cannot walk to the beach from the main hotel, you need to take a shuttle bus which is no great hardship and well worth the effort as the beack area is stunning and the food cooked freshly a la carte.",Date of stay: August 2012,Jolie Ville Royal Peninsula Hotel & Resort,1,"Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt"
excellent suites in KL,"The Pacific Regency Hotel Suites, in Kuala Lumpur, represent fantastic value for money.
The rooms themselves are spacious, light and have commanding views to the city.
Jewel in the crown is the refurbished Luna Bar and pool area on the roof which has excellent 360 degree views to klcc and the petronas towers.
This will be our 3rd stay and its like a home from home for £100usd per night

The Hotel is a short walk to all amenities and the is an abundance of taxi at the doorstep.
Best of all was the service, which really pound for pound knocks our western hotels for six.",Date of stay: April 2012,Pacific Regency Hotel Suites,1,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"
Amazing location locked in the 70's,"The hotel has an amazing location , however it's quite souless.
The rooms are all large with commanding views, however at these prices £150 per night
you do feel the atmosphere is lacking.
The bar area is only missing ""george and mildred"" or ""terry and june"" it's at best dank and boring, at worst the waiting room at an east european tax office.
The resturant smells of breakfast all day,
The pool area is nice enough with good facilities and helpfull staff.
The staff in general are helpfull enough, they are just hindered by a poor hotel enviroment.
What this place needs is a russian billionaire and it could be the jewel of the south coast, but until then tidy up after the cleaner and pay your £7 per night to park......",Date of stay: July 2012,The Imperial Torquay,1,"Torquay, United Kingdom"
"Holiday Inn. Patong ""doesnt feel like a chain""","Dont be put off it's a holiday Inn, its much better than many 5 star resorts in the area , and the staff undergo group training and team talks every day to keep them in focused. And focused they are, attentiveness and helpfullness are second to none, the hotel is clean and well managed and all facilities are well maintained.
Location is great, just on the main beach road but set back enough to still be calm.
Pools are fabulous and the food is great.
Kids clubs and meals were excellent.
Tried to book again but full for my holiday slot!

"Jaz Mirabel Beach, good hotel in a ok location.","Hotel was above average, staff were helpful and polite.
The resturants are above average and the childrens pools are fabulous for kids of all ages.
All areas are clean and well kept and the bar staff will look after you better if you tip! (we always tip well first few nights and it seems to be apprieciated as staff look to see if you need replenishing)
the only issues we had were no first aid box? How can you have a 4 star hotel with no antiseptic cream... daughter was scratched by a cat in the hotel and i ended up walking a mile to the pharmacy to buy creams. ( We live by Liverpool and Nabq backstreets make even me nearvous)
Also if your buying stuff from the privatly owned shops on complex, check your change!
Nabq is a bit of a dive to be honest so we went to naama bay , which is a trek in the local cabs but much better than Nabq.

dive sites lifeguarded well so no safty issues there.
Great holiday hotel, but nabq not as good as Naama bay.",Date of stay: August 2011,Jaz Mirabel Beach,1,"Nabq Bay, Egypt"
Stop moaning and relax......,"Just back last week from 2 weeks in Sharm Waterfalls resort.
If your looking for Fly and Flop holidays, this resort is hard to beat. The excellent and overworked staff are continually smiling. Customer care was excellent and front of house staff knowledgeable and effiecient.
Food as with all ""all inclusives"" is a bit samey, but of good quality.
welcome relief from the dining room buffet experience came in the form of a weekly free dinner at the Verdi italian or Zhale lebanese resturant which are both on site.
Pools were cleaned regularly and in good order and pool staff were effiuecient and relaxed.
The house reef extended some 400m and was in excellent condition with a fabulouse veriety of marine life.
Rooms were good size and well cleaned and maintained, but if your booking as a family of 4 book two rooms by booking 1 adult and 1 child in each room as we felt cramped and the sofa bed for the kids was tired.
There are lots of shops and facilities just off resort so you can break your evenings up.
Kids club was average mine found it unstimulating and preffered the pool. (ages 4 and 7 )
Animation team were popular and ever present,
if using the Shish bish lounge at evening time expect the odd ant bite.......

If your looking for trips out....
Naama bay is £3 taxi (5 mins)
Old Town is £2 by taxi (3 mins)
Soho square is £10 by taxi (15 mins) all one way but I suggest using George at the OZO Limo hire (by front desk) who will match these prices, cars have seat belts and air con and whos drivers speak english and dont badger, haggle or change prices on you, and will slow down when asked.

Thats all folks , very relaxing, good value four star.....................",Date of stay: August 2011,Hilton Sharm Waterfalls Resort,1,"Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt"
bueatiful hotel,"Our rooms were double booked, so we were asked to stay at the tichka salam hotel opposite, the staff at kenzis were very helpful and couldnt have been any more helpful. They included lunch at kenzi hotel along with our booked dinner meals and were very thoughtful, 4 days into our holiday a conecting room became available and we were offered a place at the semiramis. good location £2.50 taxis to main square but the food was exceptional.
I have read many reviews about the food being ""same every night"" but it was plentiful, of good quality and fresh. Facilities good but pool was crowded as fully booked.",Date of stay: July 2010,Hotel Marrakech le Semiramis,1,"Marrakech, Morocco"
