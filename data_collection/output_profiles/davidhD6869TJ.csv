Out for only the second time since March,"Lovely food as always and really friendly staff.
In today’s strange climate we felt perfectly safe and comfortable.
I always like to come here, top notch food and a warm welcoming atmosphere.",Date of visit: August 2020,Aroma Asian Restaurant,5,"Burnley, United Kingdom"
"Not just any boat trip, this is special.","Okay, so we’ve all been on boat trips haven’t we? You know the score, they take you somewhere for lunch then take you to a beach for a swim then to return to whence you came at the end of the day!
This is not just different, it’s spectacularly different.
After arriving in the morning to a warm welcome with freshly baked cake and lovely Greek coffee we set sail.
After maybe 45 minutes we arrive and proceed to haul in the nets which have already been placed in situ the previous day.
What’s in the nets forms the basis of our lunch. Three kilometres of nets later and we have Grouper, an abundance of lobster and various other things. The crew then proceed to prepare a delicious meal of fish soup, lobster, spaghetti cooked in the lobster water, beautiful fresh salad (all organically grown by Antonia) and whilst this is being prepared Antonia gives us some amazing bruschetta to whet our appetite!
After diving off the boat into the beautiful sea, eating the fabulous food we then set sail and lay the nets for the next trip.
Bloody brilliant!
If you only go on one trip make it this one, for €60 it’s a bargain, it’s worth way more than that for the lobster alone.
Thank you Antonia and Michalis, it was a pleasure to meet you and spend a day on your boat.
It was interesting, fun and most of all delicious!",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Evening meal.,"This would be our fifth or sixth visit to this restaurant over a year or three and it just gets better.
The food is traditionally prepared and simply excellent.
The service is faultless and that's saying something these days.
The waitresses and waiters are people with kind hearts and they genuinely want you to enjoy your evening.
What more can I say, just try it and see for yourself. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed.",Date of visit: July 2016,Hellenikon Taverna,5,"Parga, Greece"
