Pyrenees trip September 2019,"Nim and I have just returned from the most fantastic trip to the PYRENEES with Colin.
Each day was packed full with incredible scenery, exciting driving and expert instruction from Colin when needed. His calm manner gave us reassurance throughout the day and his humour added to the week.
We stayed in clean and comfortable Hotel with delicious food and drove from Andorra into Northern Spain each morning, which added to the adventure.
On a number of occasions we were awestruck at where we could drive in the outstanding surroundings with shear drops and magnificent mountains. The driving was very different every day and got better and better as the week went on.
Colin went above and beyond making sure each person was happy and enjoying the week. We are both still processing all that we saw and experienced and the great adventure we had.
If you have a land rover don’t miss this trip.
Thank you Colin.",Date of experience: September 2019,North Yorkshire Off Road Centre,5,"Robin Hoods Bay, United Kingdom"
Great day!,"We had an absolutely Awesome day out with Dimitrios and Efthimia.
Within minutes of arriving on the boat we’d been made to feel extremely welcome and soon after watched the first net be hauled from the water, everyone joined in removing the fish and learning what they were.
The day continued to get better and better we swam, made new friends and then were given the most delicious feast of fresh fish, salad and home made wine. Need I say more!!
If you have the chance to go on this trip don’t miss it. It was an unforgettable day!
We hope to return.
Thanks Dimitrios and Efthimia.
