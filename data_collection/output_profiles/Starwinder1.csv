Highlight of Rhodes!,"I could not recommend this enough. A 4/5 hour trip with meal and all the fish you can catch the price is excellent.

The captain Vasilis is very friendly and helpful, especially when my girlfriend who very occasionally gets seasick began to feel ill for a few minutes.

He was always on hand to help if we needed anything and is a very good cook everything was grilled perfectly and the fish is the freshest fish you will ever have, as its only just been caught.

Next time we visit Rhodes we will definitely be taking this trip again.",Date of experience: May 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
