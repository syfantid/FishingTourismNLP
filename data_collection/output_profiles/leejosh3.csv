Platinum Marriott Member With Awful Expereince,"I just want to let any and all Platinum or Gold members that this hotel does not honor your status, and will go out of there way to treat you as if you mean nothing to them for you loyalty. This is actually the first time I have written a review and I have been a Platinum member of Marriott for years. I will not comment on the resort itself, however, the booking and treatment of your as a preferred guest is extremely lacking and frustrating.",Date of stay: November 2017,JW Marriott San Antonio Hill Country Resort & Spa,1,"San Antonio, Texas"
An amazing trip with a spectacular crew.,"My wife, daughter, and I went on the sunset fishing tour and we had an absolutely wonderful time. Captain Anthi is a fantastic host and she did such a great job telling us about Santorini and its beaches as well as teaching us about the traditional fishing methods on the island. They then put on a one of a kind dinner in which we were constantly be served by her and her crew. If you have time while you are in Santorini I highly recommend you take her tour and enjoy a great experience, a great crew, and a beautiful sunset.",Date of experience: September 2017,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,1,"Santorini, Greece"
I felt like I was floating on a cloud after,"My wife and I went for a massage/ laser facial at the Spa Onali. Everything about this place was perfect from start to finish. First off we were staying at a different Hotel and during the reservation of the massage they were able to arrange safe and reliable transportation for us to and from there spa.

When you arrive you immediately notice how gorgeous the place is, it's on the East end of the island and it's right on the ocean. It also has one of of tallest viewing decks on the island, and when you are standing on it you can see the whole island from tip to tip.

The two women who run the spa are a mother and daughter duo and they are spectacular. The mother is the house doctor and she gave me a facial (i'm a guy by the way and have never had a facial) that literally changed my opinion on them. It was spectacular.

They also have several massage therapists that are all wonderful. My wife and I enjoyed the services so much that we went 2 times during our 4 day visit.

I highly recommend making a day out of this while you are in Isla or better yet stay there as they have a hotel now and get the whole experience.",Date of experience: July 2016,Onali Pronatura Spa and Clinic,1,"Isla Mujeres, Mexico"
