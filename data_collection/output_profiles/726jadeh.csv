Best day of our holiday ❤,"This was our second trip out with Dimitris and this time we had a 14 year old with us & fair to say we all agreed this was the best day of our holiday (and we're only half way though!)
Highlights included snorkeling & watching Dimitris dive for urchins and oysters. Dimitris caught a small octopus that we were able to pet.
While on the boat we ate the freshest urchins, oysters, breem, prawns and fruit salad.
The whole day was fantastic and I couldn't recommend it enough.",Date of experience: August 2020,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
5/5 doesn't do this place justice,"We had the 10 course tasting menu. The quality was indescribable. Without a doubt this was the best place we ate at while in Lisbon. The food, the service and the atmosphere was faultless. We would have happily paid double and still would have thought we'd got an good deal. You should definitely go here.",Date of visit: October 2019,A Taberna do Mar,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
We had a really good waiter,"The experience wasnt for us. The novelty of taking a numbered ticket to wait to be seated soon wore off. We waited 2 hours. The restaurant was very very busy and lacked any intimacy- though our waiter was very attentive, passionate about seafood and friendly. The giant tiger prawns were overcooked and very difficult to pull the meat from the shell. The crab we ordered lacked flavour and seasoning. Nothing was startlingly offensive but this was by far the most expensive meal we had (1x crab, 4x scarlet shrimp, 2x giant tiger prawns, bread, 1 bottle of wine= €150) and definitely not the best.",Date of visit: October 2019,Cervejaria Ramiro,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Would recommend,"Really friendly host. We both had the sardines to start which were delicious. The steak and tuna were also really tasty. The host helped us decide on a beautiful bottle of wine. To end the meal we asked for 2 glasses of port. One of the ones we asked for wasnt in stock so the owner gave us an older, more expensive one for the same price- a lovely gesture. If you go here you wont be disappointed.",Date of visit: October 2019,The CorkScrew,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Best kebabs in Skiathos,"We visited on numerous occasions, to eat in the restaurant and to take away. We tried most things on the menu- the cheese pies were especially delicious. The portions are big and the prices are reasonable. Would definitely recommend :)",Date of visit: September 2017,"Under The Pine Tree, gyros -souvlaki",1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Really good kleftico!,"Don't have a bad word to say! We were given fresh bread with olive paste as we sat down which was really tasty. To start we had the tzaziki and beetroots which were delicious. We both ordered the lamb kleftico which was amazing. Loads and loads of really tender, tasty lamb topped with melted cheese and served with soft buttery potatoes. The portions were huge and the food was faultless. The waiters were friendly, chatty and speedy.",Date of visit: September 2017,The Big Bad Wolf,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Our holiday local,Really lovely staff who remember you year after year. Always have the football on two large screens. Lovely atmosphere and decor. Nice cocktails and a long happy hour. We stopped by for a drink or two most nights. You also get a complimentary bowl of snacks with each round which was a lovely touch. By far our favourite bar!,Date of experience: September 2017,La Bussola Bar Koukounaries,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Magical!!,"The setting of this lovely little tavern sets it apart from the rest. The garden with all its lights, trinkets and plants was utterly charming. The tables and menus are all individually hand painted with beautoful floral designs. All the little touches neant that everywhere you looked, there was some other pretty thing to admire. And the food didn't disappoint. We had the feta with honey which came hot in a thin and crispy pastry drizzled with honey and scattered with sesame seeds. For our mains we ordered the meatballs and pork chop. The portions were huge! My plate was piled high with juicy, well seasoned soft meatballs in a really fresh tomato sauce. The pork chops were more like a pork steak and came in a pair. They were also exceptionally tender and juicy. Both dished came with a pile of real, home made chips and a cabbage side salad. Completely faultless! We absolutely couldn't fit in a desert.... but managed to finish the complimentary ice cream that we were brought. So glad we found this place- we will definitely be back!",Date of visit: September 2017,Kipos Taverna Bar,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Really really good meat!,"Wandering through town we happened upon the heavenly sight of Koziakas' spit. Transfixed by it's spiralling beauty we resolved to return again the following day with the sole intention of stuffing ourselves with juicy, caramelized meats. We ordered the cheese saganaki to start followed by a portion of pork and lamb. The cheese was delicious and we fought over the last bits. The meat was sublime. Tender, juicy and crispy in parts- just as you would hope. The only reason we gave this 4/5 instead of top marks is because the meat was served with plain rice and a shredded cabbage-y salad that didn't really add anything to the dish... maybe if it had some sort of vinigarette on it, it would have complemented the meat more? But definitely don't be put off. This is a great place for carnivores to get their fix while moseying around this delightful town and we left extremely satisfied!",Date of visit: September 2017,Koziakas,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Very nice food with a very nice view,"We went with my dad and his partner who had been earlier in the year and had exclaimed that the food and the views were beautiful. We ordered a Greek salad, fried zucchinies with tzaziki and cheese pies to start. All of which were tasty and plentiful. For our mains we had the salmon linguine that came served with caviar, the seafood moussaka, normal moussaka and lamb kleftico. Everyone really enjoyed their food and we were lucky enough to get a table right on the edge of the balcony giving us front row seats to a stunning sun set. The meal was rounded off with a complimentary glass of brandy. Would definitely recommend this place!",Date of visit: September 2017,Infinity Blue,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Alright place for cocktails and people watching,"Lovely area in town over looking the harbour, under a big tree full of singing birds. We stopped by a couple of days for some happy hour cocktails when the drinks are half price- at full price, €12 a drink is a bit steep! The drinks were nice and some came in lovely glasses. I think it all depends on which server you got as to whether or not you got good customer service. The first day we were tended to by a friendly chatty bloke. The second we had someone who didn't take his eyes off his iPhone screen while taking our order.... so, it's an OK place but it's not like you're missing out on anything that special if you don't go.",Date of experience: September 2017,Rock n Roll Bar,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Very average,"We were quite excited to hear there was a new chinese restaurant open in Skiathos. Four of us went to see if it was worth all the fuss. The place itself looks clean and well presented. The staff were very attentive and polite. Unfortunately the wine was undrinkable. We're not fussy wine drinkers at all and in no other restaurant have we been unable to have the wine but this one was watery, tasteless and sour. We ordered beers and left the wine almost untouched. The food was ok. We had duck spring rolls to start but I think the duck must have escaped. For our mains we had chicken satay, pork in wine and garlic, chilli and garlic chicken and beef with mixed veg. Unfortunately the rice was completely cold. The food wasn't bad except for the chilli and garlic chicken. The sauce had a very jelly-like texture and the chicken tasted very synthetic. All in all it was average and we wouldn't be too fussed about going back when there are so many other incredible places to eat.",Date of visit: September 2017,Zen,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
What more could you ask for?!,"We had room 14- one of the bungalows. We booked the magda apartments after close family had told us how idillic it was and how they wouldn't stay anywhere else on the island now. We are only on night 7 out of 14 and are already booking our next holiday here.
The rooms are kept pristine, the kitchen is very well equipped, the owner and staff are more than pleasant and the pool is lovely with plenty of sunbeds.
The location is beautiful with orange trees and rose bushes. Very close to a range of bars, restaurants, breathtaking beaches and convenience stores.
Other main things to note are how friendly the other guests are and how bright and starry the nights look. Oh and expect daily courtesy visits from Lady Loretta and Master Fat Cat- resident mutt and puss- they like to check you are settled in and enjoying yourself!
If you booked your holiday in the Magda apartments you would not be disappointed... except for on the day you had to leave!",Date of stay: June 2015,Magda Apartments,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Lovely!,"Quick, efficient but absolutely pleasant service. Good, hot and tasty food. Big portions!! Very reasonable price. Beatiful restaurant and surroundings. We went with family who had visited the year before- the waiter and the staff greeted them like old friends; i thought that was a really lovely touch! Dont have a bad word to say about the place!! Would definitely go again!",Date of visit: June 2015,The Big Bad Wolf,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Excellent food and hospitality!,"The captain and his staff are a delight! They kept us giggling throughout our visit while also giving us sufficient space to enjoy our meal in peace.The captain reccomended pork stamna for my dad (who had his reservations about eating there in the first place- let's just say the joint is rustic'.) The stamna was delicious! As were all the other dishes we ordered.
You will not be dissapointed when you eat here- and i dare say when you receive the bill you will be delighted!
Our visit was topped off by the captain giving my self and my friend a Gardenia flower as we left. What a gent!",Date of visit: June 2015,Taverna Captain Michalis,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Not impressed,Got there about eight. The place seemed dirty and grubby and had a lingering damp smell. There were already some considerably drunk people lined against the bar making it very difficult to get the attention of the bar staff. We were thibking of getting something to eat but we were told they no longer serve food there which is a bit of a shame considering how good the food reviews are on here. We didnt stay for a drink as the atmosphere wasnt a nice one and there was definitely going to be a long wait to get a drink. Wont bother going back.,,The Attic Bar,1,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"
A really lovely night,We came here after our plan A disappointed us. We had the meat meze to start- no complaints there. And mixed kebabs for mains- again tasty fresh food with lovely service. The owner brought us some more of the meatball sauce to eat with our mains after we enjoyed it so much with the starters. If anything the wine could have been kept cooler and according to my partner the main course could have been bigger- but he does have a larger than average appetite! Its a cosy local joint and we would go again- the lunch menu looked to be really good value.,,Lefteris Greek Taverna,1,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"
Can't fault this fab little cafè!,Me and my boyfriend go to this cafè everytime we're over from Liverpool visiting family. The breakfast is beautiful- lovely fresh produce cooked to perfection and served with a healthy dash of banter. Would recomend to anyone- you won't be disappointed!,,The Corner Cafe,1,"Crawshaw Booth, United Kingdom"
Dirty,"The table was sticky, the menu was full of sauce and grime, the cutlery was smudgy and to top if off we were sat close to where the dirty plates were cleared to and could over hear the waitresses talking about finding cockroaches. We didnt stay for the food so cant comment on that. Wouldn't ever go again!",,The Tavern Company,1,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"
DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF CUSTOMER SERVICE,"First have to mention we stayed at the hotel after buying a deal on Groupon so value was good. Thats the last positive thing to be said about the hotel.
When we arrived the receptionist advised our room wasn't very nice but we could pay for an upgrade. That wasn't a good first impression.
As warned the room was tiny with only 4 hangers on a tiny rail to store clothes. Didnt appreciate that they charged for wifi either. The bed was also uncomfortable.
The meal we had consisted of supermarket samosas served cold, fish pie that was 80% cold under cooked mash and hot chocolate fudge cake served with (a teaspoon) of cream and - again- cold. I asked the waitress (an eastern european lady) if it could be served hot to which i got the short reply: 'no'
We did not come accross one friendly member of staff. The less than mediocre food and shabby pokey room could have easily been forgiven if only the staff made us feel welcome.

Arrochar itself is beautiful but this hotel is a big let down. Really could do with someone taking over the management so this hotel (which is so beautifully positoned by the loch) could reach its potential.",Date of stay: April 2014,Arrochar Hotel,1,"Arrochar, United Kingdom"
Terrible service!,"Told a 10 minute wait for a table- ended up being 30. No apology. Bar tender was exceptionally impatient waiting for our order- if im paying £7 for a cocktail i will take my time with my decision thanks! And if you roll your eyes ill take longer! Waitress took my friends drink before it was finished, when she asked for a it back she got a real snarl- not attractive! To be fair didnt have to wait long for food which was ok. Got the impression all waitresses and bar tenders thought they were way too cool to serve us with any form of manners or common decency. Wouldnt go again",,Almost Famous,1,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"
