Fishing tourism day,"Yesterday a wonderful day on the boat of Michalis and Antonia, despite a bit of fog in Pessada to be framed among the most beautiful memories of Kefalonia.
I want to thank Antonia and Michalis with all my heart for having introduced us, through the fun, the true life of the fishermen made of hard work and sacrifices and often not sufficiently compensated as they deserve.
An experience to try absolutely",Date of experience: July 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
