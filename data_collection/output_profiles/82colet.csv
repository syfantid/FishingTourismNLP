Out on the sea in a fishing boat,"This is my very first review, although having trip advisor for years.
So you get the point...

Our day out with Nikos and his crew was beyond anything I have ever expected it to be.
There is so much that you can learn from him as he very well educated not just concerning being a fisherman or about the sea.
The trip itself included fantastic food directly prepared after we got the catch onto the boat.
In the first place the asked 80 Euro seemed to be a little steep, but what you get in exchange is absolutely worth the money.
The trip lasted for 7 hours, the fish that we ate was already not too far away from 80â‚¬, all drinks (no matter what) were also included and available in MASSES.
Anyway this trip will stay with me for the rest of my life!

Cheers to you Captain Nikos!",Date of experience: June 2018,Milos Fishing Experience,5,"Milos, Greece"
Never been dissapointed,"Have been eating here probably 20 times within the last two years and was never disappointed.
