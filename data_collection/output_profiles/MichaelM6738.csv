Amazing experience,"Fishing trip with Captain Michalis is a great experience if you are going to visit Rodos.
We visited many beautiful natural harbours which we wouldnt be able to find otherwise and learned a lot of things about fishing from a truly fishing Guru and great host.
Totally recomended and we will be back for sure next time we visit Rhodes.*****",Date of experience: August 2018,Captain Manolis Fishing Trips in Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Amazing place,"We stayed for five days in this magnificent small hotel in the center of Heraklion close to all sights and we totally recomend it.
The room was big and beautiful and the bathroom was really clean.However the highlight of this hotel is the small restaurant and the amazing tasty plates of chef Manos that will satisfy all of your senses.
We will be back for sure!!!",Date of stay: May 2018,City Green Hotel,4,"Crete, Greece"
"Amazing,quite atmoshere...","We had a great stay here last july.The owner Stratos was very helpful with anything we asked for.Ms Sophia cooks amazing traditional plates.
The location of the hotel is at a very quiet place but so close at the center of Ialysos which make it ideal.the rooms are very big almost like a regular house,renovated and very clean.
I highly recommend it and we are going to visit it again for sure in the future.",Date of stay: July 2017,Platoni Elite Apartments,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
