Hard to think how it could have been better....,"We went out last Tuesday and had the best time; lovely hosts, good company interesting experiences and the most amazing fresh fish lunch it's possible to have anywhere I'd imagine....

If every single review on TripAdvisor is 5 stars, that tells enough of a story in itself (and is amazingly rare), so I won't repeat what's been written previously as there's no need.

Just thank you for a superb day that we won't forget x",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Very enjoyable trip out,"Was up in Swaledale with nine of my family and friends and did the Swale Trail on the Saturday afternoon (half day hire).

We only got as far as Gunnerside, which takes about an hour each way. It was thoroughly enjoyable (the weather was lovely which helped) and I'd recommend it as a way to see the beautiful countryside.

Three of our party (mixed ages - up to late sixties) hired the electric 'bikes which I think is a good idea if you are feeling at all nervous, but my advice would be to book up and try it as it's great. Nice bit of Victoria Sponge too ;-)",Date of stay: June 2019,Dales Bike Centre,1,"Fremington, United Kingdom"
Tremendous Sunday Lunch,"We were lucky enough to win Sunday lunch for four in a raffle and booked up for Fathers Day. The whole experience was first class; friendly service, an extensive menu, cosy setting and a fabulous three courses which we all really enjoyed.

We are lucky to live in North Yorkshire because there are so many great pubs serving lovely food, but we all agreed that we hadn't had any better than this.

We will be back and next time I'll bring my wallet!",Date of visit: June 2019,The Wild Swan,1,"York, United Kingdom"
very pleasant stay,"We were at Captain's Villas last week and thoroughly enjoyed our time there. The villa's aren't huge, but the beds are comfy, the aircon is powerful and the shower is both powerful and hot (each villa has it's own solar panel for water heating). The outdoor seating areas are comfortable, with padded chairs. Overall we thought it was good value for money and the owners are friendly and very responsive, as has been previously reviewed (we had a toilet issue and it was fixed within 2 hours of us reporting it and that included going to get the spare parts).

The nearby mini market and (very good) bakers make self catering easy. It's a ten minute walk to the seafront where most of the eateries are. I can't say we had a bad meal anywhere, but the rolled sole at Maria's was probably the highlight.

Lookout for Adonis the turtle who comes to the harbour each morning (about 8am) - worth going to see.

I certainly hope we will be returning.",Date of stay: August 2018,Captain's Villas,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
very enjoyable,"We didn't have a bad meal anywhere in Katelios, but thought Maria's was the best overall venue. The food was delicious (rolled sole with prawns in cream, cooked in a clay pot), as was the wine and we ended up sitting on the beach (at our table) on both visits, which was lovely. Staff are friendly too. Well worth a visit.",Date of visit: August 2018,Maria's Taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Enjoyable Tea,Echoing the previous review really. We went last week whilst up in Hexham on holiday and we all enjoyed it. The guy who runs it is very friendly and explains how to order and the food was very tasty and extremely good value. Definitely worth popping in.,Date of visit: April 2018,Little Mexico,1,"Hexham, United Kingdom"
A bit like being in Greece ...,So ... it was leathering down last week and our holiday in Hexham was a bit of a washout. Then we visited Stalida and the world got that bit sunnier! The early bird menu is amazingly good value and the food was magic. The service was friendly and we even got a free shot of ouzo. For just for a few minutes we were transported across the Med. Thanks - very enjoyable!!,Date of visit: April 2018,Stalida Greek Taverna,1,"Hexham, United Kingdom"
Entertaining and enlightening,"Went with my boy last week and thoroughly enjoyed it. I've been to SJP literally hundreds of times over the years but our guide, Tom, had plenty of info that was new to me and I learned quite a lot (especially about dressing rooms and pitch technology)

Great photo opportunities for the kids and really good value as it was nearly 2 hours in duration. Well done Tom and thanks a lot.

PS - Ashley Out and no, Rafa won't be going to Arsenal!!!",Date of experience: April 2018,St James' Park,1,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"
Sunshine on a rainy day...,"Took the missus yesterday for a birthday lunch. Drizzly day in Harrogate, but we experienced a couple of hours of 'sunshine in doors' as Peter Kay would put it..

We like Greece. We've been a lot over the years. And in a nutshell, the food here is better than anything we've had on holiday; beautiful dips, tender slow-cooked stiffado, succulent monkfish ... (and Mythos too!)

Craig looked after us brilliantly and we had a real laugh as well as great food

Highly recommended and thanks very much!",Date of visit: November 2017,Mykonos Bar & Grill,1,"Harrogate, United Kingdom"
Brilliant day,"We are just back from Afitos and had booked the Bulli Safari largely on the great reviews on tripadvisor. And it was even better than we'd expected.

Mira was lovely (very knowledgeable and great company). This isn't a 'booze cruise' type of day out; it's a chance to explore the area and the culture with someone who lives it day in day out, but it also appeals to all ages as our two kids both loved the day out as much as we did. Highlights were a beach with practically nobody on it (in August) and seeing turtles swimming in the nature reserve. The lunch is fantastic too.

I couldn't recommend this trip more highly and it's worth every penny.",Date of experience: August 2017,Bulli Safari,1,"Afitos, Greece"
Lovely stay in Afitos,"We just got back last night and I thought I'd put a review in as we really enjoyed our stay at the Stratos hotel.

A lot of the 'good bits' are covered in other reviews so I won't repeat too much; generally the hotel is very clean indeed, the breakfasts are amazing and set you up for the day and Afitos itself is absolutely beautiful.

A few other small observations on Stratos that make a real difference:

The ladies who run the place work extremely hard and are friendly as well as professional. They put my family at ease and make the running of a hotel with multi-national visitors of all ages look easy and seamless (I bet it's not).

The shower is the best I've encountered in Greece - loads of hot water for 4 people, morning and night. I've had so many holidays where dad gets the last shower and it's freezing...

Mosquito doors on the balconies - brilliant! So you can have the doors effectively open without being eaten alive.

The little touches make a big difference and overall, I think you'd really struggle to find a better 3 star hotel than this and for value for money, it's quite outstanding.

Finally, there's a lovely black and white dog who sometimes sleeps in the grounds. The kids are heartbroken that we couldn't bring 'big dog' back to the UK (we have 3 rescue animals already). If you are in the area and have a spare stroke or a tin of dog food, he'd be very grateful I'm sure...",Date of stay: August 2017,Stratos Hotel,1,"Afitos, Greece"
"traditional greek food, done very well","We didn't have a bad meal in Afitos, but we tend to go back to our favourite on the last night and Christos got the vote this year.

The menu is what you'd expect to see really (souvlaki, stiffado etc), but the portions are large, the price is decent and the quality is really good.

The greek salad was the best of the week and I had lamb kleftico twice. It's individually sealed in tin foil with the herbs etc (no microwaving) and absolutely fall-apart delicious.

The staff are friendly and there's a free ouzo / sweet at the end.

I'm back at work today and really wishing I was back in Afitos... I don't suppose you can survive indefinitely on greek salad, Mythos and sunshine, but it would be an interesting experiment...",Date of visit: August 2017,Taverna Christos,1,"Afitos, Greece"
nice pizzas - thin not stodgy,"Enjoyed our meal at PetraFlora. So many non - Italian places abroad make thick, stodgy pizzas, but these were thin, almost crispy and delicious. Well done!",Date of visit: August 2017,PetraFlora,1,"Afitos, Greece"
lovely sardines,"Interesting restaurant in that you can go for the 8 euro sardines (I did and they were delicious) or spend 60 euros on a swordfish steak for two, so lots of choice in terms of menu and spend. My wife eats fish all the time and had red snapper (20 euros I think) and said it was the best fish of the week.

Good food, nice atmosphere and friendly staff",Date of visit: August 2017,Strouboulis Taverna,1,"Afitos, Greece"
excellent Sunday Lunch,"We tried The George yesterday and found it to be very good indeed. We had kids with us (who can be fussy) as well as grandparents (who are harder to please than the kids) and we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.

There was plenty of beef and chicken (both very good quality), lots of piping hot veg and home-made Yorkshires. For afters we all had the sweet selection which was like a mini taster menu.

At £12 for 2 courses it's excellent value and we fully intend to return.

A special mention for our young waitress, who was both pleasant and professional and we were surprised to hear it was her first day. An impressive debut!",Date of visit: August 2017,The George at Wath Restaurant,1,"Wath, United Kingdom"
Third time lucky (again),"Just come back tonight from a 4-night easter stop in Cala Pi Club and it was fab.

We've been a couple of times before but not since 2014 and it's still as good as ever.

The breakfasts worked out at c £4.50 each which when you see the selection and quality of food, is an absolute steal. Staff are helpful and friendly, the pool was just about warm enough to swim in and the beach uncrowded and better than I remember.

Needed a jumper on a night, but Cala Pi Club was brilliant and I don't know who is more depressed to be back home, my wife and I or the kids ...",Date of stay: April 2017,Ona Cala Pi Club Aparthotel,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Brilliant pizza,"OK, so we went to Miguelette's which is their snack bar next door, but the pizzas there are really good value and extremely nice (thin and almost crispy, but not too much cheese on like you often find abroad).",Date of visit: April 2017,Restaurante Miguel de Cala Pi,1,"Majorca, Spain"
what a rip off!,"The best way I can describe this experience is that you pay (heavily) your monthly gas bill, but then have to pay extra if you actually want to put the fire on.

Ok, it was bank holiday weekend, but far, far too many people crammed into the place. The waits on the rides were 1hr plus (unless you paid extra of course) and whilst I'm on the subject of charges - an extra £5 to park the car on top of £50+ per person to get in???? Also £7 to have a face painted and £8 for a 'refillable' cup of coke ...

The actual lego models of cityscapes etc are really good, hence the one star, but otherwise the rides - when you finally get on them - were mediocre to say the least and in general, attempting to shuffe through a bizzare and packed gathering of the worst examples of loud, rude and pushy humanity you are ever likely encounter made it feel like being extras in 'Walking Dead' for the day.

Recent visits to Drayton Manor and Lightwater Valley have been far more enjoyable. This place borders on the shameful.",Date of experience: August 2016,LEGOLAND Windsor Resort,1,"Windsor, United Kingdom"
It's ok ...,"That's what I'd say really - it's ok. It's quite expensive for a family to effectively walk (or shuffle if you go when it's busy - some friends told us afterwards late afternoon is best) around a wood for less than an hour which is what it takes. The wood is certainly different and if you are a fan of Merlin then I think it will work for you (my 12 year old thought it was great).

The ratings go from 'very good' to 'average' (4 stars to 3) and I'd probably say it's marginally better than average to be fair...",Date of experience: June 2016,Puzzlewood,1,"Coleford, United Kingdom"
"Lovely, fresh and ridiculously cheap!","We were down in Cheltenham for half term and one of the girls in Cath Kidston recommended this as a place to eat. We weren't disappointed at all - it was really good! The premise is a bit like Subway in that you tell them exactly what you want in your burrito. The ingredients were really fresh and tasty, the portions were generous and the bill for a sit down was pretty much what you'd pay for a sandwich and a coke in M&S. my wife loved it and the kids thought it was 'well cool' whatever that means ;-) - highly recommended!",Date of visit: June 2016,Paparrito's,1,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom"
A pub of two halves...,"Really odd place to review - in short we went twice, once was great and once was very poor ...

We were on holiday last week and arrived at the cottage about a mile's walk from the pub. It was Saturday afternoon and nice and sunny so we walked up the lane and had a really good lunch in the beer garden. The lady behind the bar was helpful, the beer was good and the food when it arrived was tasty and plentiful. So we booked for last Thursday and the 'fish night' with some anticipation...

....However it was like a different pub. The landlord was in and let's just say isn't particularly charismatic. The guest ale had changed but that's nobody's fault, but the issue really was with the food and specifically the portion size.

We saw the 'specials' going past before we ordered and they looked lovely - fish and chips and a seafood paella. But when they arrived I'm not exaggerating to say that they were about half the size of what we'd seen being served earlier. 'Full size' suppers continues to be served (to locals as far as I could see) as we (all too quickly) finished ours and they continued to be significantly larger that we'd been given. We mentioned it politely to the landlord who mumbled something I didn't catch and when the bill came there was no reduction or further mention.

Make of this one what you will - you may very well get a nice meal. You just might need a magnifying glass to see it, depending on what day of the week you turn up and whether (it seems?) you live in Blaison or not....",Date of visit: June 2016,The Red Hart Inn,1,"Longhope, United Kingdom"
Brilliant day,"We went last week and these guys were really friendly and helpful. We'd not done this before so they strapped 2 canoes together for us (me, my wife and the 2 kids) and off we went down the Wye...

We saw an otter, 2 leaping salmon, a kingfisher and loads of other wildlife - it really was idylic and nowhere near as hard as you might imagine. We had a great week down here but this was the best thing we did and so memorable - thoroughly recommended (and I know the tempation is to think ""can we really do this?"" - you CAN - don't miss it) !!",Date of experience: June 2016,Wyedean Canoe & Adventure Centre,1,"Ross-on-Wye, United Kingdom"
Really good afternoon,"Not done this before but the kids wanted to so...

It was really enjoyable - the trail isn't too steep, but yet there seems to be lots of good downhill bits to freewheel and the surroundings are beautiful. The bikes were first class, the staff helpful to us 'beginners' and overall it really was a lovely way to see such a magnificent part of the country. It took about 3 hours but that included a picnic stop-off",Date of experience: June 2016,Wye Valley Mountain Bike,1,"Ross-on-Wye, United Kingdom"
Magnificent Pies!,"Now I do like a good pie... There seemed to be some confusion over whether this pub was open or not before we set off for a long weekend in Sedbergh, but it is indeed open and certainly worth a visit.

There's a blazing fire and a friendly welcome, but the home-made pies are the main attraction - less than a tenner for a choice of pie with fat chips, peas and gravy.

We had chicken and pork & cranberry and both were absolutely majestic. It's 90 mins from our house and I'd actually consider driving over for a pie, which tells you all you need to know really... if you are anywhere near and yo like pies, call in as you won't be disappointed!",Date of visit: March 2016,The Red Lion,1,"Sedbergh, United Kingdom"
"Absolutely tremendous, time and again","We drive up from Yorkshire to see my dad in Hartlepool quite a lot and invariably go to Fishface and I can say hand on heart it does the best fish and chips I've ever had.

Lots of chip shops are good at either fish or chips, but here both are superb and in fact the mushy peas are tremendous too - kind of smokey and delicious.The portions are generous and the service warm and friendly.

The only place I can think of that rivals it is Scotts in Helmsley, which are very nice, but Fishface is much better value as a sit down option. Certainly better than anything I've had in Whitby.",Date of visit: September 2015,Fish Face,1,"Seaton Carew, United Kingdom"
Shiver Me Timbers (in 34 degrees...) !!,"We came back from Kefalonia yesterday after having had a really lovely family holiday. The day out on our yellow boat was the highlight (apart from the Mythos - only joking!). We pre-booked before we flew over which was probably a good job as they seemed very busy. You basically get about 30 mins of training before-hand, which is important as it's easy enough once you know what you are doing, but I'd not have liked to just jump in one and try my hand.

Then you are off up the coast and it's great to be able to pootle into 'secret' beaches and get the snorkle on. You return for 5pm, so it's a pretty full day, but one you won't forget and at less than 100 euros for a family of 4 including fuel, it's also a lot cheaper and more personal than the traditional 'trip'. Remember to take plenty of fluids as it gets hot out there",Date of experience: August 2015,Yellow Boats Kefalonia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
lovely food,"Agia was the only place I've ever been where I can honestly say I didn't have a bad meal. The food everywhere was good and great value, but we enjoyed Pergola best, even though it's not on the main drag. It seemed more authentic, the food was delicious and the portions generous. Try and sit upstairs if you can as it has nice views of the mountains.",Date of visit: August 2015,Pergola,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
pub 'basics' done properly,"Went last Thursday with my wife and 2 kids. Maybe 'basics' is too harsh - what I mean is that the food isn't fancy, it's just what you'd expect on a pub menu, but it's done really well. Gammon was massive and lovely, fish and chips were of chip shop quality for sure (hard to do properly in a pub) and the kids really enjoyed the generous portions from their menu. Well done - highly recommended. Final note - we were staying in Tetbury where everything is rather over priced so even happier to find this place.",Date of visit: May 2015,Radnor Arms,1,"Malmesbury, United Kingdom"
not your ususla stately saunter...,"I really don't enjoy looking round old houses all that much. I did this one because my wife lusts after Ross Poldark. But goodness me, this was an enjoyable couple of hours! Where else would you hear stories that encompassed Dennnis Taylor playing snookler, headless ghosts, planes crashing into trees, royal kleptomaniacs and Gemma Arterton in the nude!!! An absolute must (thank you Caroline)!!",Date of experience: May 2015,Chavenage House,1,"Tetbury, United Kingdom"
Very nice break,"Thoroughly recommended. Pauline is a very nice lady and extremely helpful. The apartment was clean, spacious, nice and quiet and warm, with comfy beds and a lovely view. We watched the boats go past and (just before we left) saw a seal, so the place lived up to it's name. 10 minute walk into Whitby centre so ideal.
Rusty Shears cafe and the Humbel Pie shop are my top eating tips!",Date of stay: April 2015,SEAL VIEW,1,"Whitby, United Kingdom"
Nothing rusty about this place,"Nothing wrong with fish and chips, but if you fancy a change, this place is fab. The menu is very imaginative and the food is really good. Pricing is reasonable, though if you are hngry you might want to do 2 or 3 courses (still, c £20 for 3 courses of really nice food isn't bad).",Date of visit: April 2015,Rusty Shears,1,"Whitby, United Kingdom"
Decent Fish and Chips,"We like Drakes. I've had better fish and chips, but not in Ripon and not very often and for the price (especially the sitting in price), Drakes ranks very highly indeed. Well done!",Date of visit: April 2015,Drakes Fish and Chip Restaurant and Take Away,1,"Ripon, United Kingdom"
lovely soup in a friendly place,"We went in with the kids a fortnight ago (Saturday). It was quite late in the day and our first choice of soup wasn't available, so they let us try different ones before we ordered, which was a nice touch. The moroccan chicken was lovely. A welcome refuge on a blowy day and huge bowls of steaming soup with loads of 'bits' in. We will return!",Date of visit: January 2014,Chambers Coffee House,1,"Leyburn, United Kingdom"
best eaterie in Keswick....,"...and we've treid a few. Friendly staff, nice cosy fires and lovely food. The Lamb Henry was tremendous, as was my wife's salmon. Kids portions were sizeable and good quality - well done!",Date of visit: November 2013,The Pheasant Inn,1,"Keswick, United Kingdom"
Really digging it!,"Sorry about the corny title!

Went to Diggerland on Saturday with the wife and 3 kids. It was a lot better than I expected and well worth a visit, but I wanted to comment specifically on how pleasant and friendly the (mostly young) staff were. It was an awful, cold and drizzly day and despite this all of the guys we spoke to were really friendly and helpful. If you contrast this with Flamingo Land, where you get more interaction fron the waste bins. Well done!!",Date of experience: October 2013,Diggerland,1,"Castleford, United Kingdom"
Second time lucky?,"We got back from our second Cala Pi holiday last night and it was as good this time around if not better.

I've covered the bases on supermarkets / things to see previously, so won't repeat that, but overall the staff were great, the standards were as good as last year and the weather was better, so we all had a good time.

Just a note on the room allocation - we 'rebooked' last October (so 8 months ahead), but it seems that you can't pre-order a rooftop terrace room, which was a little disappointing. We did get one in the end, but apparently it's difficult because of the mysterious 'members' who get first choice on the rooms when they come.... Probably the only downside; I kind of expected that if you'd paid up front you'd be guaranteed a certain type of room, but that's not how it works.

This time we paid 200 euros for the 4 of us for 3 days half board. The food was very good indeed and excellent value I think. It lets you take in the 'big' nights such as poolside BBQ as well, so you can build variety in pretty easily.

Locally Miguels now has a snack bar and they do really good pizzas. It's less formal and cheaper than their original restaurant.

Final note - if you are thinking of going to Palma and are nervous about driving, there's a great underground carpark which has it's own sliproad 'under' the catherdral, so you just come off the motorway and park without having to negotiate the city centre roads. It's worth the trip as the city is lovely.

Hoping to go back once again next year!!",Date of stay: July 2013,Ona Cala Pi Club Aparthotel,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Pie-fect!,"Went at the weekend and it was as good as people say. 6 of us - 3 different versions of pies, all £4.99 and all tremendous. Just what you need on a cold winters day (especially if you don't want fish and chips). Had to wait 10 mins for a table but it was worth it - well done - coudl eat one now thinking about it (and it's only 8am!)",Date of visit: December 2012,Humble Pie 'n' Mash,1,"Whitby, United Kingdom"
"Lights, camera, action (for all the family)","We took the kids for the first time on Saturday and we all really enjoyed it.

Car parking locally was fine at £3.50 all day. They have an indoor picnic area which is great as you can bring your own food and drink and not get tied in to the cafe (which may well have been nice, but that's not always the case and this was handy to save a few £).

The museum itself had something in it for everyone, from history of photography, to Zippy from Rainbow, to old arcade games like Galaxian and Defender. Highlights were probably the mini cinemas you can go in and watch whatever you want from a massive catalogue (my lad and I took in a Dr Who from 1971 in a 2 seater). Also the animation workshop, where you can make clay models and use them to create a short cartoon - the kids loved that.

We should have timed it better and got a bargain curry while we wree in Bradford to complete the day, but the museum was fantastic. The fact it's free makes sure it gets full marks.",Date of experience: November 2012,National Science and Media Museum,1,"Bradford, United Kingdom"
Things that go bump (on your bank statement),"Went yesterday with my wife and was pretty disappointed. The guy at the ticket desk was easily the spookiest aspect of the visit.

On the plus side, the house itself is quite atmospheric (particularly the 'seance room' where you can well imagine supernatural things happening).

There's too much 'dressing' though - the house doesn't have to have zillions of 'spooky' artefacts plonked all over because that just spoils the atmosphere rather than helps it (Emma Bridgawater spotty jug in the cellar??).

The tape recording is also pretty poor - I wanted to know the history of the house rather than have actors screaming about dead babies and such like. No need for hamming it up!

The house is very atmospheric and I think it coudl be made into a much better attraction. £18 for 2 people for 20 minutes - too steep!",Date of experience: November 2012,"Haunted, 35 Stonegate",1,"York, United Kingdom"
Good family day out,"We enjoyed this place and considering it's free, I'd certainly recommend it. The mine tour was informative and enjoyable (you certainly leave with increased respect for those who have made their living that way). The guy who took us down was a bit of a comedian (Norman Colliery?) and was a bit brusque with some of the women and kids, but in a funny way and we enjoyed it.

The only thing I'd say as a slight 'negative' is that once we came out of the mine (c 2.45) the on site train had stopped running and the pit ponies had been put away, so if we'd known that we'd have done things in a different order. Arrive early and you will get to see everything.

We didn't eat in the cafe but the food looked nice and it wasn't too bad price wise either.

Worth a visit!",Date of experience: November 2012,National Coal Mining Museum,1,"Overton, United Kingdom"
