Saturday Lunch,"Visited on a busy Saturday lunch, we had booked a table and where quickly seated, the waitress was attentive and service was good. Food arrived I had the risotto which was delicious, My partner had the fish and. Chips which he said was also delicious, we didn’t have room for a pudding, all in all I very pleasant experience. My only gripe would be £9 for a glass of wine, which I feel was over priced, yes I know we pay more for wine out dining, but this is a pub, not a high class restaurant. Apart from that a good meal was had",Date of visit: February 2020,Judson's Bar,4,"Pocklington, United Kingdom"
Spa night away,"Myself and a couple of friends returned for a girlie spa.we had visited the spa some five years ago, and had good memories. These memories unfortunately were not to be repeated.
Yes the hotel is under refurbishment this however should not impact on. The guests staying, there.
We where booked in for lunch, but no record could be found, a change over of systems where to blame ! We did get lunch and the went. For a relaxing swim, the whole pool area is looking tired and the jacuzzi was not working.
Dinner that evening was below what we had experienced before. I had the chicken very dry, my baked Alaska pudding was awful, not sure where the meringue was.
Our room was on the 5th floor it was clean, the only problem being the wake up call from the work men at 7.30 the next morning, with their drilling and banging. When we mentioned this at check out, we where told they had heard nothing, probably because they where on the ground floor, a course in customer service is needed there. On the who.e a very disappointing stay and I doubt we will be back.",Date of stay: October 2019,Aldwark Manor Golf & Spa Hotel,4,"Aldwark, United Kingdom"
Lunch meeting spot,"A group of ladies met up here, before moving on to a weekend away. It was a great start to our trip. We did book. The staff are extremely friendly and made us feel most welcome. The food was delicious all served piping hot, we just managed to squeeze in a pudding. Would highly recommend",Date of visit: October 2019,Ebrington Arms,4,"Kirkby on Bain, United Kingdom"
Weekend away,"We spent a fantastic weekend in the orangutan safari tent. We where celebrating a 50th birthday. The tent was clean,beds comfy, and kept warm with the copious amount of logs we had delivered for free. The staff were most helpful, the hot tub was checked twice a day. The rain poured but we were snug as a bug. Our only gripe was there was no frying pan for our bacon butties, but we improvised with a pan. We didn’t venture from the tent to try the on site activities. Well worth a visit.",Date of stay: October 2019,Bainland Lodge Park,4,"Woodhall Spa, United Kingdom"
Fantastic day Fishing,"This trip was booked to celebrate a birthday, there were 7 of us in our group and it was the most amazing day ever. I was a little worried about sea sickness which I had suffered from before, I have to say I didn’t, feel unwell at all. The whole day from start to finish was excellent, Giorglas and his crew where most welcoming and informative the whole day, from putting the nets out to the surrounding area and the bays we stopped in. The food was delicious, and we enjoyed sitting and chatting with the Other 5 guests on board. Yes it was an early start but so worth it",Date of experience: August 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
