What a wonderful day we had with Tassos, a fun and thoughtful host. Stopped for lunch at a wonderful fish restaurant. An all round perfect trip despite catching no fish."

2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Janie,August 2019,5,Amazing day with Tasos on a boat trip around Poros.,"We loved our day with Tasos. He collected us from the jetty below New Aegli Hotel and brought some wonderful local food for us to eat on the trip: Baklava pastries, biscuits, fresh bread and cheese from Galatas, fresh fruit and salad vegetables, soft drinks, lots of ice cold water and lovely local wines. There was more than we could eat.  Tasos took us on a journey around Poros island. He was really considerate and kind host. We stopped in several places to swim, secluded bays with crystal clear, turquoise blue water.  The children had great fun jumping off the boat and swimming in these quiet coves, which you couldn't reach by land.  Tasos was very aware of safety, we felt totally confident in him and he was very knowledgeable about the places he took us to and what we could see in our journey.  He is such a lovely person to spend time with and made us feel really welcome on his boat. This was such an amazing experience for all of us. We were two families with several teenage children and we all had the best day of our holidays.  I have been visiting Poros for over 40 years, but this is the first time I have been around the whole coastline of Poros and the first time I have visited the beautiful Daskalio island near Russian Bay.  I highly recommend Poros Fishing Tours to take you on a breathtaking tour of Poros' coastline with exquisite places to swim. But it was Tasos himself that made the trip extra special. Thank you for a great day and wonderful memories!…"

Fishing, swimming, dining, and sightseeing are some of the activities that made this a GREAT trip, but the MEMORIES that were made that day are not to be missed!! Our day there has long passed but the memories are thought of fondly and often. So, if you and your spouse or family have the opportunity to book this adventure I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! A day with Tasos on the sea is most definitely a PERFECT day in a not so perfect world. …"

Swimming, fishing, stopping at several islands and having a lot of fun. Boat is not luxurious, but if fantastic captain and atmosphere, fresh fish dishes for lunch, also attention to customer is your priority - this is the best choice in Poros!!!   P.s. ask Tasos to show some jokes on his phone :)…"
