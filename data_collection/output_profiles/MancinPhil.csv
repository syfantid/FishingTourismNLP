Excellent Experience for an Amateur Climber in Winter Conditions !,"My guided climb to the top of Ben Nevis was an excellent experience from my initial inquiry until the climb was complete. I would absolutely recommend Kirkhope Mountaineering if you wish to climb with a guide, and I would definitely recommend a guide in winter conditions as I encountered on my climb last week. Despite what you may read climbing Ben Nevis in Winter and low visibility is dangerous and a guide is a must if you are an amateur climbing such as myself. My guide Ben was very easy to talk to for the whole climb and we had many interesting conversations and laughs. We made a fast ascent and descent and completed the climb in about 6 hours, but that was not rushed. We set a good pace and stuck with it. Due to the blizzard conditions and sub zero temperatures at the summit we didn't stick around long !",Date of experience: November 2020,Ben Nevis Guided walks,4,"Fort William, United Kingdom"
Great Private tour of Bangkok and surrounds,"Our guide for the day Elena met us at the hotel. We sat down over coffee as she explained the city and what options we had based on what we would like to see. We did the palace and Wat Pho then had lunch. We then left Bangkok and went to a farming area 30 minutes from Bangkok. This was fantastic as we saw how many different products were farmed. It included a few boat rides. It was a great day. Thanks to Elena for being a fun guide for the day, and making things easy and stress free. Our first visit to Bangkok and the city is huge, so I recommend this guided tour for any first timers. Thanks again Elena !",Date of experience: December 2019,Private Guide In and Around Bangkok: Custom Tour,4,"Bangkok, Thailand"
A taste of real Chinese food,We were met by our guide Linda at our hotel. Linda took us on an amazing tour over more than 3 hours around Beijing. Linda was very pleasant and well educated to provide us with much information about what we ate at each location. TIP - Do not eat too much too early !! There are maybe 8 stops on the tour to sample food. We felt guilty towards the end as we were full and could only try the last few dishes. No pressure to eat the food though. Linda was very friendly and likeable and would recommend her for this tour. Thanks Linda !,Date of experience: December 2019,3-Hour Private Night Tour: Beijing Foodie Experience,4,"Beijing, China"
Snorkeling tours,Took 2 snorkeling tours. Very well priced for the amount of stops made. The experience can all depend on which longboat driver you get. Overall a great experience and would recommend,Date of experience: December 2019,Paradise Tours Koh Lipe,4,"Ko Lipe, Thailand"
Alone on the Great Wall !!,"We were picked up at 7am by Bruce in a nice Toyota sedan. The drive to the wall was relaxing with some information from Bruce given. Bruce answered any questions we had, but otherwise focused on the driving. He stopped off to give us some water. We arrived at the wall around 8.30am, This was the best part because nobody was there. Even the workers were just arriving !! We got the cable car up to the wall. Bruce walked with us and took some photos of us, then he let us walk on our own. There was no one on the wall !! Took some amazing photos before anyone else showed up, so I thoroughly recommend leaving early. Bruce arranged to meet us in a cafe after we were done. No pressure on time at all. We spent a couple of hours on the wall then took the toboggan down. Great time. Parts of the wall are steep so be prepared for a work out. No special shoes required.",Date of experience: December 2019,Mutianyu Great Wall 5-8 Hour Flexible Private Tour with English Speaking Driver,4,"Beijing, China"
Cost Effective way to see the southern side of Milos,"Very good value for money at 35 Euros. We did the sunset cruise and glad we did, as you can make use of most of the day until you board at 3pm. The beach where you board is nice and has a great spot for lunch while you wait. The boat is an old fishing boat with some character. You are served drinks and some water melon, so be sure to eat before you board and you do not return until 8pm. Overall a great way to see the southern side of Milos without spending 100 Euros on a crowded yacht or catamaran.",Date of experience: August 2019,Armi Sea Excursions,4,"Milos, Greece"
Makes sure you do this if you're in Pollonia !,"My wife and I travel many Greek Islands and always take boat tours. This by far was the best we ever did. This is for a several reasons. 1) It's a small boat so only a few other tourists will be with you on the boat, no party boat chaos. 2) The crew were happy, helpful and made us feel very welcome. 3) The route the boat takes is excellent, and many stops for swimming. 4) The atmosphere was never rushed. 5) The experience of seeing fisherman at work, and being able to participate in the experience was fantastic. 6) Actually eating the fish that you catch that day. 7) The price - very reasonable considering everything is provided and the meal is excellent.

Some tips - 1) During the summer the winds can make the sea a little rough. My advice is call Andreas to discuss when the boat will go to Polyegos because this is the tour you must do to have the best experience from Pollonia. 2) As the boat is a fishing boat there is not much storage, so pack lightly for the trip, take just the basics (a towel and sun lotion is basically all you need). 3) Again it's a working fishing boat, so I do not recommend very young children for this trip. Ages 10 or over would be fine.

Many thanks to Andreas, Andreas and Marios. It was brilliant. If you remember my wife was the opera singer who sang while she was putting the nets in the water :)",Date of experience: August 2019,Explore Milos with PoseidonÂ®,4,"Milos, Greece"
Fantastic personal boat trip away from the crowds.,"Possibly the best 4 hours of our trip to Zakynthos. Boat is small which makes the trip very personable. However, because the boat is small the trip is dependent on weather conditions so call them as soon as you arrive on the island to book the trip. Boat owners are very friendly and easy going. There is no rush on this trip to meet deadlines getting back to port. A very relaxing and fantastic experience.",Date of experience: July 2017,Renata Boat,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Perfect location away from everyone...,"Location was perfect for us. 5 minute walk from the town and beach. Private access to the sea for amazing snorkeling. Amazing views of the sunrise directly from the balcony. Owners very friendly and flexible for check in time (we arrived at 9pm). Parking is free and spacious. Apartment is clean and basic. It has a fridge and some plates and utensils, but cooking in the apartment is not an option. But who wants to cook their own food !! A few extra glasses would be helpful, and also the shower is open so the floor gets wet. A shower curtain with the shower head on the wall would be helpful, however none of these minor comforts take away a fantastic stay at this location. I recommend it.",Date of stay: July 2017,Palataki Absolute Blue,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
