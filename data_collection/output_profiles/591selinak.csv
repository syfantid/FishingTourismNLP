Most amazing part of our trip!,"Amazing views, service, food and experience! Cannot recommend coming here more. We paid for the VIP area which was well worth the money especially because all they money can go towards food and drinks. The staff were all very lovely and attentive too. Will definately be recommending this place to everyone and would love to return.

Best day of our 6 week holiday!,"This was the highlight of our trip. Dimitrios and Efthimia were absolutely wonderful hosts, soo down to earth and entertaining and go out of their way to make sure everyone is comfortable and has a great time. Not to mention the food was better than in any restaurant by mile!!!! Such a great cook!
We went to 3 secluded beach spots to swim and in between helped remove fish from a gill net. The fish was prepared and cooked while we were all swimming and everything was timed to perfection. I will definitely do this again when back in Kefalonia!",Date of experience: September 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
