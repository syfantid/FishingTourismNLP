Great bacon sandwich!,Super little coffee shop with great service and a super menu to choose from. The coffee is great and the bacon sandwiches are scrummy.,Date of visit: January 2020,Bradleys Coffee Shop,1,"Anglesey, United Kingdom"
Going downhill,We have always loved this fish and chip shop and have rated it the best on the island but queued three times recently only to be told that they have no haddock!! It is bad enough once but a notice on the counter or on the door advising that they have no haddock would have saved time and tempers. Very disappointing,Date of visit: January 2020,The Golden Fry,1,"Anglesey, United Kingdom"
Kebab delight!,"We had a meal to celebrate my daughters birthday before going to a concert at Parr Hall . The oysters were a melt in the mouth delight and the prawn and calamari in tempura batter disappeared with gusto. Two of us ordered the teriyaki fish kebab and the other ordered scallops. The kebabs were eaten with relish and the scallops were large, meaty and cooked to perfection. The staff are friendly, discreetly attentive. I would thoroughly recommend this to couples and groups alike.",Date of visit: November 2019,The Grill on the Square,1,"Warrington, United Kingdom"
A magical day!,"An absolute must for anyone visiting Kephalonia even if you are not into fishing! Efi, Dimitrios and Mohammed are fantastic people who went out of their way to make every part of our trip enjoyable. Greeted with coffee, tea and pastries we set off to sail down the coast. We watched the hauling in of the fishing nets and the preparation of the fish, drinking refreshing tasty home made lemonade. We then had a swim in a beautiful bay before sailing further down the coast for another swim whilst Efi cooked the fish and prepared lunch. The highlight of this second swim was dipping into a pool of clay at the end of the beach and covering ourselves in this elixir of youth!! We all swore we looked 10 years younger afterwards!!! The very best part of the day came with the consumption of beautifully cooked fish with salad, potatoes and bread washed down with really good home made red wine, bliss on a plate! The company was really convivial and it made for one of the best days of our holiday.",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Brilliant place to stay!,"What an absolutely great place to stay. Very quiet location but central for getting around the island with lovely gardens to relax in, very well maintained and plenty of parking. The hygiene is second to none with linen changed every couple of days and washing machine and washing line provided for guests use. Grigoris is the most delightful friendly host who greets all guests on arrival and is there each morning and evening so if there are any problems (we had none) he can sort them out. He was very helpful with advice on which beaches were close and how to get to various attractions of the island. If and when we return to Kephalonia we will book into this lovely place once more.",Date of stay: September 2019,Dina Apartments - One Bedroom Apartment,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Hard work pays off!,This is a great place to visit and see the ongoing work which is being carried out to bring this ruin back from the brink! The hard work that is going into this restoration is amazing.,Date of experience: May 2019,Gwrych Castle,1,"Abergele, United Kingdom"
Coffee bliss!!,The coffee here is the best by miles! The toasties are great and good value and the staff are really pleasant. Well worth a visit.,Date of visit: June 2019,The Plantation Coffee Shop,1,"Abergele, United Kingdom"
Coffee catastrophe!,"Well I suppose once you have been to one outlet they all seem the same but at least we had heard the cafe had good food so we thought we would give it a try. The place is pleasant enough and the food we had was really good but if you want a decent cup of coffee don't bother here! Hot brown water was the best way to describe what came out of the machine, not good enough in this day and age, how difficult can it be to provide decent coffee?",Date of experience: June 2019,Tweedmill Shopping Outlet,1,"St. Asaph, United Kingdom"
Heaven on a Plate.,"This was our first visit to Sosban and it didn't disappoint. Just when you thought that it couldn't get any better, it did! The Wagyu beef course was simply divine and I am not a lover of ice cream but the ice cream lollipop with dark chocolate was scrumptious. The bottle of red Pinna Fidelis was such a good accompaniment to the meal. We will return!!",Date of visit: June 2019,Sosban and The Old Butchers Restaurant,1,"Anglesey, United Kingdom"
NOW that takes the biscuit!!,"Having been to Jollys a few times with my husband and enjoyed it I popped in for a coffee and decided to have a shortbread biscuit. When I came to pay my bill was £5,15 which was £2.20 for the coffee and £2.75 for the biscuit. I said to the delightful lady that had served me that I felt that the biscuit was overpriced and I would not be visiting again and that I would certainly be putting it on tripadvisor. The manager turned round and said I was rude and that the prices had nothing to do with them. She also said that she had handed her notice in due to the abuse she had had from customers over the prices. I was not rude or abusive, it is not in my nature, but I do not like being ripped off and wanted the message passed on to the owners. I was offered a refund but as I had eaten the biscuit and not asked the price before I ordered I said no thank you but will not returning. There are plenty of others places to go in Beaumaris and I would suggest people try them instead.",Date of visit: September 2018,Jollys,1,"Anglesey, United Kingdom"
Fantastic Restaurant,"This was the best experience of a good restaurant in a long time. The food was exceptional and the staff brilliant so much so we are going back tomorrow! I would recommend this place to everyone, well worth a visit",Date of visit: August 2018,La Fiorentina,1,"Glasgow, United Kingdom"
Signage required,Visited Pollock House eventually after touring the gardens first! No signs to say where entrance is and we and others had to ask ground staff where to go. It is a lovely house to visit but to compare it to Downton is a little pretentious! It is great to be able to wander around rooms without being behind ropes. Do visit the cafe in the basement as it is a great place to eat.,Date of experience: August 2018,Pollok Country Park,1,"Glasgow, United Kingdom"
Above average,This is a light airy place to eat with staff who are friendly and attentive without being over the top. The food was very enjoyable although a little 'samey'. It would have also been more enjoyable without the smell of the spray that the tables were cleaned off with permeating the surroundings.,Date of visit: August 2018,India Quay,1,"Glasgow, United Kingdom"
New restaurant!,"The zoo has just opened Oakfield House as a new place to eat. Brilliant move. This place is great if you want something a little more special and to spend time with the people you are with. The menu is extensive and when it arrives the food is beautifully presented and delicious, we had the rump of lamb and ham eggs and chips, the lamb was epic and my 94 year old mother, who has a small appetite, ate her ham etc with relish and cleared her plate! We are already planning our next visit which will include a visit to the Oakfield.",Date of experience: August 2018,Chester Zoo,1,"Chester, United Kingdom"
Planning our next visit!,Extensive menu and comfortable surroundings with friendly efficient staff make this a great place to have lunch. The lamb was epic and we are already trying to schedule our next visit to the zoo when we will definitely be visiting the Oakfield.,Date of visit: August 2018,The Oakfield,1,"Chester, United Kingdom"
Delightful place to visit,"This is a great place to visit. Congratulations must go to Cadw who have really done a lot with this castle since our first visit in the early 70s!! The free audio guide is informative and means that you can work your own way around the castle. Make sure to visit the tearoom, the coffee is great tasting and the bara brith scrumptious",Date of experience: July 2018,Castell Coch,1,"Tongwynlais, United Kingdom"
Great day out for all the family,"This museum has expanded over the years and is a great day out for all ages and it is free! Yes you have to pay to park and it would be great if you could pay for this by card rather than cash but it is worth it. There is a lot to look at and the members of staff we spoke to were informative and very pleasant. We ate in the restaurant and the meal, welsh faggots, was excellent in light airy surroundings.",Date of experience: July 2018,St Fagans National Museum of History,1,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"
Information boards required,This is a great castle covering a huge area. The surrounding water was being cleared of weed when we were there and this was much needed. The castle would benefit from more boards around the site informing visitors what happened in that area. There is a great stone carving of a soldier crouching down to protect himself from missiles thrown from above but the information is on the wrong side so most visitors will not see this from the path! There was no information on the large wooden siege machines which are in a section of the castle grounds. This is a great place for children to run around and play freely. The dragons are super,Date of experience: July 2018,Caerphilly Castle,1,"Caerphilly, United Kingdom"
Return Visit,This is a great place to dine. The food is excellent and the staff are friendly but without being over effusive. The prawn and smoked salmon cocktail is epic but would benefit from a wider container to make it easier to get to the prawns down at the bottom!,Date of visit: August 2018,The New Inn Baschurch,1,"Baschurch, United Kingdom"
Well worth a visit!,Thank goodness that this has been saved by the Gwrych Castle Conservation Trust. There is a lot of work to do in the coming years but it is a beautiful place to visit with spectacular views and so peaceful. We shall look forward to visiting in future to see the progress that is being made with this fantastic place.,Date of experience: June 2018,Gwrych Castle,1,"Abergele, United Kingdom"
Brilliant Time!,"This is the best place to eat In Cabo! The lobster and shrimp are brilliant. It has not changed since our last visit 8 years ago! Still the same great staff, still great food and still a great experience. Not to be missed.",Date of visit: February 2018,Maro's Shrimp House,1,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico"
Delicious!,"Spent a lovely evening eating Lasagne and drinking Sauvignon Blanc after a day snorkelling, perfect end to a perfect day.",Date of visit: February 2018,El Merkado,1,"San Jose del Cabo, Mexico"
Awesome!,"We went out with Tania as our guide who was informative and eloquent and very knowledgeable. Every precaution is taken regarding safety and the captain was very experienced. The trip was fantastic, whales were found and followed but at a safe distance so as not to disturb them We followed a mother and her calf who was full of the joys of life and gave us the most fantastic, thrilling time, breaching and chin slapping it was the most wonderful sight to behold. To cap it all we have just received 290 brilliant photos taken by Tania which gave us the opportunity of watching the whales without the worry of trying to catch what we were seeing on camera ourselves. Do not miss this trip it is well worth every penny spent.",Date of experience: February 2018,Whale Watch Cabo,1,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico"
Good snorkeling,This is a public beach and very well cared for and safe with clean toilets and showers and life guard! The snorkeling is brilliant with a great variety of fish. Unfortunately the beach has changed since our last visit 8 years ago when we were the only people on the beach each day but even so it is a lovely place to spend the day.,Date of experience: February 2018,Chileno Beach,1,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico"
Don't miss the bats,"It is 47 years since I visited the zoo (I am not a fan of zoos) and it has obviously changed in that time - big style. We arrived at opening time and they locked the doors as we left!! Brilliant place, lots of enrichment for each and every animal which are all in super condition, We saw everything apart from the penguins as they are getting a new enclosure. The best part of the day and something not to be missed is the bat cave! Surrounded by bats flying in at close quarters the smell leaves something to be desired but well worth it, we didn't want to leave and Phil the member of staff in there was brilliant. Friendly and knowledgeable he came across as someone who enjoyed his job, it was a pleasure to speak with him. All the staff we spoke to were helpful and very friendly. This is a must for anyone of any age.",Date of experience: September 2017,Chester Zoo,1,"Chester, United Kingdom"
Fireworks - not!,"We have been attending the tattoo for over 20 years and only missed a couple due to illness. This has always been spectacular with a Saturday night finale of fireworks. Each year the tickets have increased in price and over the last few years the fireworks have decreased until this year we had a finale which when watched by the royals included fireworks to Conquisador, when we were there we listened to the music with a flash of fireworks at the end. We were not the only people who questioned the lack of fireworks and it cannot be blamed on the weather as we have been there with much worse and had fireworks. Next year it will be the Pipe Band Championships for us we will watch the highlights on the television.",Date of experience: August 2017,The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo,1,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Wonderful!,"We have stayed at Arden house a number of times and yet again we had a wonderful stay. From the welcome coffee and home made cakes to the stylish and very comfortable bedroom everything was perfect. The wonderful breakfasts set us up for the rest of the day. We highly recommend this elegant house as a place to stay,it is so close to Edinburgh with plenty of places to visit within a short distance.",Date of stay: August 2017,Arden Country House,1,"Linlithgow, United Kingdom"
Delhi Delight,We dined here on Friday 18th August. Our meal was delicious from start to finish. The service was excellent without being over the top with very friendly and observant staff. My only criticism is that the restaurant is very hot and became uncomfortable so much so that we had to go out for some fresh air. If this is rectified then it would be perfect.,Date of visit: August 2017,Delhi's Winter,1,"Linlithgow, United Kingdom"
Fantastic day out.,"This is the first time we have visited the castle and we were absolutely blown away by the experience. The castle is fantastic, there is so much to see but the Stirling heads gallery is awesome. Every member of staff we came into contact with were super but the guide who gave us the tour went above and beyond all expectations, he brought the whole thing alive and made the whole experience enjoyable. I don't remember his name but watch out for the guy with a pony tail and a booming voice - brilliant! You really must eat in the cafe, fab food, fab service, not the usual offerings. Unforgettable day.",Date of experience: August 2016,Stirling Castle,1,"Stirling, United Kingdom"
Leaves you breathless!,You do need to be fairly fit and agile to climb to the top but once there you can catch your breath and enjoy the fantastic views - stunning! You can also use each level to restore your energy before getting to the top as there is quite a bit to see and a lot of information offered. Either stoke up your energy levels at the cafe before beginning the climb or restore them afterwards but either way the food offered is great.,Date of experience: August 2016,National Wallace Monument,1,"Stirling, United Kingdom"
Overpriced drinks!,"We have eaten here before and really enjoyed it, the food is great and the location is brilliant. We ordered 2 Peroni and the lamb shoulder. The meal was great although the potatoes could have been warmer but they were acceptable. What was not acceptable was the price of a bottle of Peroni - £3.40. I know this is a continental beer but even so this is overpriced and has put us off returning here again.",Date of visit: July 2016,Corn Mill,1,"Llangollen, United Kingdom"
Nothing Special,"We thought that this would be good for lunch as the place was busy. The food was very nice but nothing special and the service was really non existent. As we departed there was no thank you for coming, enjoy your visit - nothing! We will not return.",Date of visit: May 2016,Fouzi's Cafe Bar Pizzeria,1,"Llangollen, United Kingdom"
Get the meal times posted on the doors,"We have been here a few times for lunch and the odd drink and ordered lunch one day when the weather was good and there was plenty of tourists about but were amazed when customers were turned away as they were told that food was nor served after 2.30 pm. but would start serving again at 5pm. Now the website states otherwise and the menu states that the sandwiches are available until 5.pm. We decided to contact JW Lees, as they request on site, only to receive no response whatsoever. Very disappointing. there are now two new ventures within Trearddur Bay and complacency will not keep the punters coming through the door. We have gone to one of the other establishments for lunch, better service, better choice, better surroundings.",Date of visit: June 2016,The Inn at the Bay,1,"Anglesey, United Kingdom"
Exemplary service,"We have eaten here many times and our visit on 20th February was up to the usual high standard. The seafood linguini was superb and the blueberry eton mess left everyone wanting to lick their dish. What made this visit a little more special was the service we received from Ally. This soft spoken gentleman was attentive without being intrusive or ingratiating he is a credit to the restaurant.
Our only gripe is that the lift for disabled patrons,which was out of order before Christmas, is still out of order so made it difficult to access for my 91 year old mother and my daughter who has a full pot on her leg. Surely this should have been dealt with before now as a matter of high priority.",Date of visit: February 2015,The Oyster Catcher,1,"Anglesey, United Kingdom"
Oh dear what can the matter be?,"We have visited this pub on many occasions in the past but have not been since last summer. My husband and I went on on 13th February and the place was quite quiet compared with when we have visited in the past we found plenty of spaces in the car park whereas we have had to park on the road on previous visits. We soon found out why! Gone are the seafood specials which were offered Thurs/Fri there used to be a choice of a couple of starters and 3/4 main courses. Instead we had one mains special of chicken! We resorted to the normal menu. This has also changed and not for the better. The couple at the next table also were unhappy, it didn't help when the waitress spilled some of the meal on the floor before she served it to this table with a 'whoops' as an apology but did not replace the food lost. We asked if the ownership had changed, as had the couple at the next table, only to be told no. It is about time that the management took a long hard look at themselves and the business they are running. If I wanted to eat usual pub food I would go to a Wetherspoons when I want something different I will not be going back to the New Inn.",Date of visit: February 2014,New Inn,1,"Huddersfield, United Kingdom"
What a gem!,"We have just spent another fantastic weekend at the stunning and peaceful Arden Country House. Everything was wonderful as usual. The coffee and beautiful home made cakes on our arrival were very welcome after travelling up the A1 from Yorkshire. Nothing is too much trouble for Beth who is truly the hostess with the mostest! Everything about this place is of the highest quality, you want for nothing! The breakfasts are truly historic I cannot imagine anyone not being able to satisfy their needs with what is on offer – the scrambled eggs and smoked salmon are to die for! Roll on next August!",Date of stay: August 2012,Arden Country House,1,"Linlithgow, United Kingdom"
Take a picnic!,"The hotel has beautiful views over the bay and we had enjoyed our last meal there so decided to return for lunch on Saturday 4th August. We ordered the club sandwich and the local seafood platter with artisan bread. The club sandwich was fine although we could only have white bread and this was three slices of thick supermarket white.The chips are fried in oil that leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. The seafood platter consisted of a small bowl of defrosted decent sized prawns, a smoked mackerel with a dry tail and a desertspoon measure of crab with two small pieces of artisan bread (more like supermarket special) with butter. Not what you expect for £11.95! Both meals were presented naked - no dressing, nil points for presentation. Next time we will take a picnic at least we will know that the prawns are fresh and the bread by a real baker!",Date of stay: August 2012,OYO Cliffemount Hotel,1,"Runswick, United Kingdom"
40th Anniiversary,"We have just spent two nights at this hotel celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary and it was the best way we could have celebrated! The hotel is great, the food wonderful and the staff brilliant. We cannot fault anything - and I am fussy!! We were discussing how warm it was and that there was not a breeze through our room and a member of staff suggested that we have a fan in our room. When we returned to our room after our exquisite evening meal not only was there a fan but it was switched on cooling the room beautifully. Nothng was too much trouble, every member of staff greeted us with a smile, they are attentive but unobtrusive this hotel is quite brillant! This was our first visit but certainly will not be the last!! Roll on October!",Date of stay: June 2012,"Another Place, The Lake",1,"Watermillock, United Kingdom"
Awaesome!,"This was brilliant! A little wet but thats the British summer for you! The force of the water was stunning the trees, especially the biggest pine I have ever seen in this country, unbelievable well worth the effort even in the rain!",Date of experience: July 2012,Aira Force,1,"Penrith, United Kingdom"
A little gem!,This really is a gem of a place. We had the feeling that Beatrix is still around and that she had just stepped out for a little while! What a super place and we found it far from gloomy but of its time! We have been intending to visit for years but never got round to it until now and it did not disappoint. This is not a grand stately home but a much loved house that gives you a great insight into the person who lived there. Well done the National Trust!,Date of experience: June 2012,"Hill Top, Beatrix Potter's House",1,"Hawkshead, United Kingdom"
