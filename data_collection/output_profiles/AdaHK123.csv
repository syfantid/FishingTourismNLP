Great dinner on the water,"I gave this 3-stars but only because the servers were inattentive. We chose to have dinner here because of the beautiful location. Our table was right on the water and the views of Poros town at night were incredible. The food was quite good (mussels saganaki are delicious). Other than the service, food is great and location is amazing.",Date of visit: August 2019,White Cat,3,"Poros, Greece"
Amazing Fishing / Lunch trip - perfect for friends or family,"We came to Poros from New York with basically no plans. We went to Poseidon Taverna (lovely restaurant) and asked the owner where we could rent a boat. He said there were no boat rental places on the island but his son (also works at the restaurant) takes groups on fishing trips. You can hire the boat privately for the day, as my fiancé and I did. We chose to go spear fishing. The captain, Giannis, is an expert spear fisherman and it’s amazing to watch him free dive. And his English is great. He caught several fish as we watched with snorkels from the surface. He then grilled the fish on board and served the most delicious lunch, fresh Greek salad, bread and tzatziki (the best meal we have had in Greece!). The boat was beautiful - an upgraded version of an authentic fishing boat with lounge chairs, a picnic table for meals, large canopy for shade, comfortable turf deck and bathroom on board. It was an amazing experience and if you like being on the water, this is a must-do in Poros.
