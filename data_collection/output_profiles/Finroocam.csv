Authentic food,"We went for a lunch mid-week ,chose quite a few dishes to taste, having lived in Spain.we wondered how good it would be! We were so pleased - the dishes we liked the most were chorizo with honey and red wine, and patatas bravas, all the others were great, the service was excellent.

Wonderful holiday,"This was our second visit this year , but this time we were with family, and Barbara studios were perfect for us all, we had aircondtioning , which you pay extra for but it is a must in July! The rooms are kept spotlessly clean and have everything you need to do a bit of basic catering, we chose B block as there is a lage picnic table there, perfect for family breakfasts/ dinners alfresco .The pool is down by the bar and it's great, we always managed to get a lounger. There seem to be a lot of repeat guests here ( us included) , and we put this down to the extraordinary kindness of the family who run these studios, Erato, Barbara and Panagis ,did everything possible to make our holiday wonderful-- and it was!",Date of stay: July 2019,Barbara Studios & Apartments,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
