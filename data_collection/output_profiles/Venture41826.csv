The only way to discover the real Milos!,"This made our European trip!
Right at the end of the season, this lovely couple, Nikos and Froso welcomed us on board their fishing boat.

Nikos (with 35years fishing experience!) and Froso (the amazing hostess) looked after us like we were part of their family.

It was great to see the unique way they fish the sea and to see the island from a different perspective.
We pulled in over 11 species of fish and ate at least 6 of them!

Red snapper grilled with salad and Nikos's home made soup and the freshest most delicious broth you would ever try!

We were treated like royalty, fed like we had never eaten and drinks just kept on coming!!

These other reviews do not lie. They are the most kindhearted people you will meet and love what they do and it shows.

We can't thank you enough, we will be back!
