Best Day,"Have to be honest going on this trip was my husband and son's idea, I went along because I didn't want to spend the day on my own! So glad I went along, Captain Gerasimos and his daughter Sissy are two of the nicest people we have ever met.
The day started with a lovely breakfast, Sissy was lovely and explained everything to us. Went out to the nets, seeing them come in was fascinating and Captain Gerry (hope he doesn't mind me calling him that!) explained all the fish that was in the nets. Had a tour round the fisherery and then went to White Rock beach which was beautiful, was taken there by dinghy, had inflatables umbrella, water and a six pack of Mythos - perfect!
Back on the boat was cooked a amazing meal - another confession - I don't really like fish/seafood but everyone else did so didn't think it would be a problem. There was so much food, everything that was caught was cooked, as we was the only people on the trip it was down to us to eat it all, unfortunately our youngest son was a bit sea sick so was down to my husband and eldest son to eat it all! You certainly couldn't get fresher and should have come clean and told them I didn't like fish as I felt bad for not eating! .
This trip really was the best day out ever, we are going back in May with friends and hopefully will be able to go again.
Thank you Captain Gerasimos and Sissy x",Date of experience: August 2018,Poseidon Fishing Tourism Kefalonia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Nice but not fantastic,"Went here yesterday (6/5/18) as I was given a voucher by my brother for Christmas, was from the Ritz itself so no discount he paid full price. When we arrived our waiter asked if we had had a good day, we replied that we had as it was my husband's birthday and our anniversary. He straight away said "" well your voucher is for traditional afternoon tea only so no champagne or birthday cake"" I replied that I knew that but felt that the comment really wasn't necessary as we hadn't asked for any extras was just making conversation. We was served with our plates of sandwiches and cakes on looking round everyone seemed to have more than us but that was fine. We had only been there 15 minutes when our waiter came over and said do you want more sandwiches as you have eaten them quickly and i don't want you arguing over what is left, which I again thought was uncalled for. While everything was "" nice"" that's about as far as I would go, we enjoyed it but won't be rushing back seemed to be treated differently if you was paying by voucher.",Date of visit: May 2018,The Ritz Restaurant,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Love this hotel,"Stayed here again last night second time we have stayed, got a bigger room than last time and everything was perfect as before. Staff are really friendly and helpful only thing different was no nuts/snacks with our drinks in the bar but won't stop me coming back!",Date of stay: May 2018,Sunborn London,4,"London, United Kingdom"
A Few Issues,"Just been for a meal, as soon as we were seated could smell a damp/ dirty floor mop smell, worked it out that it was coming from the door the staff were taking dirty plates back to. Smell seemed to get worse the longer we was there, service was good food was fine but when son and husband went to the toilet - my husband is on crutches as broken his hip but as toilet was on ground floor he didn't think he needed to use the disabled - what a mistake! The floor was swimming in water both my son and more worryingly my husband slipped and slid about 4 feet across the floor, my son just managed to steady himself and help my husband before he fell over. Reported it and was told it was being dealt with but was very scary for both my son and husband.",Date of visit: May 2017,Harvester Rayleigh Weir,4,"Rayleigh, United Kingdom"
Great value friendly apartments,"Great value and spacious apartments. Nearest metro station is a 2 minute walk and a big supermarket underneath the apartments where you can buy anything you need at reasonable prices.The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, we arrived at mid day and check in was at 3.00pm we left our suitcases with them so we could start enjoying our holiday and done the same on the day we left. Apartment had everything you needed and the sheets and towels were changed twice in the week we was there. Would definitley stay again",Date of stay: August 2015,Aura Park Nord,4,"Barcelona, Spain"
will definitely be back,"Only just found this fantastic place, our son has been at Warwick uni since Oct 2014 but only discovered this little gem when we visited on may day bank holiday to celebrate my husbands 50th. We travelled up on the Friday night didn't get there till 8.45 the welcome we received was brilliant the food even better. We called in the next day for a quick drink they remembered us and asked if everything had been OK. This will definitely be our place to go in the next 4 years our son is at uni.",Date of visit: May 2015,The Cape of Good Hope,4,"Warwick, United Kingdom"
