New to area,"Just moved just a few minutes walk from The Old Boathouse, after days of constant unpacking we decided to walk down and have lunch at our 'local'.
We werent disappointed friendly staff, lovely atmosphere and very tasty food.
We both ate off the 2 courses for £8.95 menu, I had pate` and hubby had soup, both were delicious (we tried each others) and then i had quiche and hubby had fish and chips, it was hot, tasty and more than worth the money.
We werent waiting long, despite being busy and werent at all rushed.
Particular reference to young lad who waited on us, excellent service and so friendly and the blonde lady who also went beyond to make us feel welcome, apologies for not knowing your names, but outstanding service.
Will absolutely return.
Thankyou for making the move nicer, and for making our first visit warm and welcoming.",Date of visit: October 2019,The Old Boathouse,1,"Astley, United Kingdom"
Our piece of Heaven,"First visit to Svoronata, decided to visit Dum Spiros Speros on our second night, beautiful 20 minute walk from Astra Village to location in Svoronata village ( although longer with my camera!!) Immediately felt relaxed, greeted at the door by owner Spiros and offered any table, which was lovely....table 27 then became ours we visited every other night after that, we tried others but the food, service and staff could not be beaten. Dad in the kitchen, mum baking, Spiros and his wife Anna out front with the wonderful Peter. You are treated as friends not customers, we witnessed people returning afters years of visiting this beautiful part of Kefalonia to be hugged and welcomed back to this wonderful restaurant. We were left to enjoy our evening rather than being rushed to order, often staying 3 hours to savour the house Rose' and the delicious home cooked food. Never had a bad dish and went through most of the menu. The homemade Taramasalata was divine, Mama Dum is a must, Stifado, Kleftiko and my personal favourite chicken Souvlaki..the whole menu was wonderful, cooked with love and flavours of Kefalonia. These special people became our friends even making me a birthday cake and singing for me on my special day....absolute gems, and we will return here for many years to come ❤️",Date of visit: June 2018,Dum Spiros Spero Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
What a fantastic experience!!!,"We are here on holiday and had heard good things about Michalis Fishing Tourism. So I contacted them and got an immediate response from Antonia, Michalis' wife..booked for two of us for the day.
Well we just returned from not just an exciting and beautiful day but an informative one too. We got to the harbour at Svoronata for 7.30am greeted by boatman Hassan with a Greek coffee. Antonia and Michalis arrived with homemade cake. Antonia is amazing at welcoming you and giving you lots of information about the island and lots of other useful tools about Kefalonia.
We set off around 8.15 with 10 other guests including children to go and pick up the nets....wow!!! Lovely people, scenery and so fascinating to watch this lovely boat on a normal ish working day....questions about the catch answered if you had any...holding the catch was amazing...especially Larry the huge Lobster ....once nets are in we pulled into the small bay at Spartia, so the team could cook the catch....amazing homegrown veg salads and lobster...beautiful homemade Salva...Bruschetta...homemade wine which was devine....lots of time for swimming in the beautiful bay and then set off for home.
Please try this experience you will not regret it...pure family run authentic day out...with amazing,beautiful people who tirelessly help to make your day amazing...the best trip ever!!!!",Date of experience: June 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Lovely,Visited here as part of our first experience of the Yorkshire coast.....beautiful idyllic place...only downside was the crowds. Whitby itself is extremely popular and was impossible to move through the masses of people. The Abbey was a quiter peaceful escape and so scenic with amazing views from the top of the cliffs down towards Whitby.,Date of experience: August 2016,Whitby Abbey,1,"Whitby, United Kingdom"
Full of fun,Visited on Regatta weekend...spent time watching the yachts..canoeists..and sailing boats coming in and out of the lovely harbour...very busy as to be expected in summer months. The walking of the plank was lots of fun to watch and drew much attention from tourists...lovely day out x,Date of experience: August 2016,Whitby Harbour,1,"Whitby, United Kingdom"
Prime view...nice food and beers!!!,"This little place has lots of pluses...lovely food, excellent prime location on Marina/harbour front...our favourite cold beer was on tap...and good shelter from the sudden downpour, yet still outside and able to watch the world go by!!!! Only negative the waitress dropped peas from a neighbouring table which exploded all over us...our clothes were badly covered and we were given no apology....despite we being the worst hit!!! Had to clean up in loos...but badly stained jackets as a result!! Would return for the lovely food and views though!!!",Date of visit: August 2016,Harry's Lounge Bar & Brasserie,1,"Whitby, United Kingdom"
Nice little place,"Whitby was hectic the day we went...we found this little cafe whilst trying to escape the masses...clean, lovely seating areas...lots to look at on the walls...including the food challenges!! Staff were lovely and friendly, menu was varied but we option for fish and chips deal....hot, fresh and tasty...not the greatest but enjoyed just the same and an excellent brew to wash it all down with!!! Not a bad little eatery x",Date of visit: August 2016,Skippers Cafe,1,"Whitby, United Kingdom"
Quick visit but would return!!!,"Called in to surprise family whilst in the area....what a lovely warm, cosy retreat!!! We didnt eat as it was a flying visit...but would definately return to sample what looked like wonderful food!!! It looked and smelled amazing...and my nieces pudding looked amazing and was a decent portion size! Our pint was lovely...and the place was wonderful and homely...im coming back to try that menu!!!",Date of visit: August 2016,Bryherstones Inn,1,"Scarborough, United Kingdom"
Very disappointing,"Just returned from a last minute booking here. Me and my partner had enjoyed two nights in the area and decided to extend our stay by another day/night our original hotel was booked so we searched for another locally and the Arrochar came up...set in a beautiful location, although we were aware of the room we booked as being a non view room as they had sold out. Got there before noon, as our previous location was quite close by. We went in just to see what it was like....the receptionist had no record of my booking, was blatantly uninterested in speaking and trying to remedy the issue, despite me having my booking on my phone in plain view...and told us to come back at three pm. So, undeterred we went off to explore the area. Arrived back at four to different staff but of the same lack of interest approach, customer service isnt Arrochar's strong suit. Given our key we went off to see the room, cannot describe the feeling when we opened the door...which by the was was a good size narrower than all other room doors....im an average sized women and i had to turn awkwardly to enter. I can only descibe this room as robbery...dark, dirty, tired, noisy and a gorgeous view of gas containers and staff break area!!! No hot water for shower/bath just warm....bath filthy with stains. Bedtime drink with off uht cartoned milk (which takes months to sour!!) Reported milk and i was brought fresh milk but thrust at me through the tiny door!! Bed was ok and we finally nodded off. Despite no hot water previous night...our teeth were brushed in scalding hot water from the cold tap!!! Breakfast was appalling, apart from porridge and the one and only pleasant staff member....we packed up and i asked the receptionist for the manager to express my thoughts of our stay...politely!!! He responded with i just work here and fill a card in from your room...difficult when i just handed my key in....this stay completely tried to ruin our last day of our trip to the Trossachs...it did not suceed but i will never return and i would never recommend this place!!! We had just left a nice hotel with fantastic views for a lot less than the Arrochar...which was the most appalling accomodation in its entirety that i have ever stayed in.",Date of stay: July 2016,Arrochar Hotel,1,"Arrochar, United Kingdom"
Lovely,Walked here from our hotel for a drink and to relax....fabulous place...wonderful views out back...besieged by wasps..but didnt spoil a lovely little place. Didnt eat as we had already eaten...but food looked and smelled wonderful...would go back !!,Date of visit: July 2016,Ben Arthurs Bothy,1,"Arrochar, United Kingdom"
View was amazing!!!,"Just returned from Argyll hotel for a short break...lovely location, decent room with an amazing view of the harbour. Staff ok...breakfast ok...it just looks a little tired in places...this place has so much history and looks so beautiful externally...just needs some love and cash to boost it back up to its former glory!!! Didnt eat here apart from breakfast which was not bad..porridge was excellent tho!!!! Wanted to stay another night but this hotel was full...so had to move on and we missed our view room...so we would return.",Date of stay: July 2016,Argyll Hotel,1,"Dunoon, United Kingdom"
Lovely place,"We ate here twice on our stay in Dunoon...lovely staff...nice atmosphere...lovely food and a great pint of Peroni !!!! I have to say our second visit the young male waiter was delightful..talking about Dunoon and our trip, and it wasnt just us, we watched him with other guests as it was a busy friday night service...and he is a credit to the restaurant. Food piping hot and fresh and my salad bowl was phenomenal!!! Full to the brim of tasty mixed leaves with endless chicken and bacon...fabulous!! Would recommend and return xxx",Date of visit: July 2016,The 51st state Bar and Grill,1,"Dunoon, United Kingdom"
Fab fish and chips,Travelled to Inverary Castle on Saturday 30th July...explored the town a little and decided we were ravenous...the smells coming out of this place brought us to the door....we were not disappointed. The most delicious fish and chips ever!!! Sat eating them on the edge of the Loch only added to the experience.....i would happily drive the five hours for a repeat lunch!! Fab xxx,Date of visit: July 2016,Mr Pia's Fish & Chip,1,"Inveraray, United Kingdom"

Nice to go back!!!,"Years ago my young daughters loved this treat at Disneyland Paris, so returning with my mickey crazy grandson this march i decided to take him for character breakfast. Lovely food, great atmosphere for kids. It was €17 each if you were a disney resident, worth the money...although characters were few and far between and the staff seemed off. But i would take him again!!!",Date of visit: March 2015,Cafe Mickey,1,"Marne-la-Vallee, France"
Amazing!!!,"If you go to Disneyland Paris, you have to eat here....absolutely out of this world, culinary masterpiece!!! Even the childrens dishes i.e chicken nuggets are delish!!!

Lost the magic!!!,"Just returned from a family trip, not impressed, been going to dlrp for 12 years, even had honeymoon there but i wont be going back. Took my daughter,partner and grandson, me and daughter been before and rest had not. So upsetting, rides closed, hardly any characters n parades...once upon a disney you couldnt breathe without characters at your feet n parades every hour ish...no more! It really disappointed me after so many years and much money spent that the magic has left the once magical place.",Date of experience: March 2015,Disneyland Paris,1,"Marne-la-Vallee, France"
Family return trip,"We have visited Disneyland paris many many times, over many years. I have just returned with my now grown daughter, her partner and my grandson and was not disappointed in our accommodation as staff were friendly,helpful and room was ok, albeit very old and a little shabby. Drawers falling apart, tv broken and wrappers under beds.My reason for this post not being great is the parks....i knew the expense as ive been before, but almost everything was closed, i was so disappointed, theres no parades anymore, no characters and basically the magic has left the place. I remember shows, parades and falling over characters and not so long ago either....but no more...after paying a few grand for a family trip for 3 nights i was devastated to see our lovely retreat such a soul-less place...the staff are fed up, the oomph has gone...and after many visits over many years my love for the place has gone too...i will not return. My main upset is for those families on a first stay there...at least ive seen the wonderful place DLRP used to be...Bon Voyage Disney!",Date of stay: March 2015,Disney's Sequoia Lodge,1,"Coupvray, France"
Perfect stay,Me and hubby just arrived home from a lovely 3 night break at Knipoch hotel....lovely hotel..lovely staff..lovely breakfast....we had a traumatic first night with no sleep due to noisy foot traffic above us but manager couldnt do enough to change things for us....ended up in a beautiful suite (room 18) stunning room and excellent views n space!! Manager n her dog Fudge were happy to stop and explain local area n the gent who served breakfast was an absolute gem...i wanted to take him home....lovely man with an abundance of smiles and wonderful phrases each morning...we loved the older room for breakfast it felt more in keepin with the house...we tried the whole breakfast menu n all were delicious...but my fave had to be the muesli....never tasted muesli that good ever!!!grounds n house are stunning and a pleasure to have experienced it in warm days. Would definately return to this idyillic location n hotel.....thankyou for a wonderful first experience of scotland!!,Date of stay: July 2014,Knipoch Hotel,1,"Knipoch, United Kingdom"
Amazing place to eat!!,Just got back from a 4 day break in Oban and dined at the Olive Garden twice.....lovely food...nice place..young girl who served us first night was fab...really looked after us...second time we went for lunch n even tho it was relatively quiet our service wasnt as great but not terrible either! We waited longer for our food but wen it came it was excellent aswas evening meal....we had the tapas selections and they were piping hot and superb...i will miss oban n this restaurant especially!!!,Date of visit: July 2014,The Olive Garden,1,"Oban, United Kingdom"

Please go....good prices for excellent fruits of the sea!!,Date of visit: July 2014,Oban Seafood Hut,1,"Oban, United Kingdom"
Unsure,I booked this hotel last minute to surprise my sister for her wedding in paphos....i was initially impressed with the hotel despite it being quite far out from anything. Room was clean n good views but im afraid barring two staff the service was rude bordering on obnoxious. I began eating at restaurant early in the holiday as it seemed reasonable 15 euros for 3 courses...but i stopped due to a young blonde waiter being extremely rude...dining alone is difficult but to be stopped mid mouthful n told to pay now n being watched was embarrassing and uncalled for....they knew me i had already given my room number where could i possibly go? So i abandoned the restaurant that evening...the shop was appalling...but i enjoyed walking to the local supermarket nr irish pub. Behind the hotel was a lovely walk which i did daily! Gorgeous scenery....i liked the fact that the hotel was a little far out....it was quietn charming...it needs an overhaul...mainly staff n shop...but it wasnt horrific....just needed some heart...as u can see it used to be amazing. I heard quite a few regulars n timesharers say that they wouldnt return despite coming to Panareti for yrs....pretty sad really!!!,Date of stay: June 2014,Panareti Coral Bay Resort,1,"Coral Bay, Cyprus"
