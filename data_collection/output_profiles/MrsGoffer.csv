Pampering end to Girls Trip,"My girlfriends and I chose to stay here the last 4 nights of our island hopping adventure. We wanted a lush, quiet, escape to relax at before heading back to reality. We found that and so much more here at Sea Dance Resort. A special thanks to Faith & Helen who were not only amazing hosts they became friends. The service and welcoming from the very first moment had shown us we had picked the best place. We had arrived hot and sticky from the boat ride and taxi from Koh Phangan. When we were greeted with fresh iced tea and chilled face towels, I knew we had found paradise. I have never liked the big resort feel so this place suited our needs. The 4 of us took a two bedroom villa with a private pool. The rooms cleanliness and design are the freshest and most beautiful that I have seen in Thailand. The bed, pillows and linens were super plush; they were the nicest I had the pleasure of sleeping on during our trip. The location is great tucked away on a quiet beach, so you feel disconnected from the hustle and bustle of Chaweng but you're less then 10 minutes away by taxi. Best chill out spot is definitely the big nets that hang over the sea, the 4 of us spent a good portion of a day just hanging out there. I would recommend the Sea Dance Resort to anyone looking for a nice peaceful getaway. Don't miss the Sea Dance Resort.",Date of stay: February 2019,Sea Dance Resort,4,"Bophut, Thailand"
Don't Miss This!,"I had 5 days in Innsbruck and the first day was cloudy so I didn't go up. I checked the webcam online to see what the view was like and it was only clouds.
The moment the skies cleared, I bought a ticket straight to the top!! Worth every penny! Enjoy!!",Date of experience: December 2018,Innsbrucker Nordkettenbahnen,4,"Innsbruck, Austria"
Great Location,"This was my second time in Innsbruck for business for 5 nights. I enjoyed my stay here!
Why I liked it:
•location close to the best attractions of Innsbruck- catch the train and cable car to go up the mountain Nordekette at Congress station, just a 5 minute walk away
•yummy breakfast, huge selection
•big bathroom with a huge bath tub, heated floors and towel warmer
•level 2 terrace and roof top terrace
•friendly staff
•basement spa with dry sauna & wet sauna ‍️
•housecoat and slippers ‍️
•traditional decor very cozy and rich
•comfortable bed, I would say above average for Europe. The pillows were little too fluffy/soft & the duvet was devine
•restaurant was delicious I went twice

️I did not like that the hotel does not have parking.‍️️
I had rented a car for the duration of my trip, if you have a car do not stay here, the only parking nearby is expensive, over my 5 days I paid over 65€. ‍️‍️‍️

Over all it's a pretty romantic place I would consider coming back with my husband.‍️‍️",Date of stay: November 2018,Hotel Schwarzer Adler Innsbruck,4,"Innsbruck, Austria"
Business Central,"My colleagues and I were here for 2 nights. The rooms are well kept and large. My king size bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows were enormous and fluffy I slept very well here. I loved that the breakfast was free, and full of endless options. They has coffee cups to go so you could take coffee with you. I loved having vitamin water and ice tea for breakfast options!!! The outdoor was too cold to go in at night so I went in the hot tub instead. They also have an indoor pool which was probably warmer but I wanted to be outside. We had meetings at Disney so it was about a 15 minute drive away. We found Gator golf down the road because us foreigners couldn't leave Florida without touching and feeding some alligators The staff at the hotel were great, they were all extremely friendly. Thanks for a pleasant stay.",Date of stay: October 2018,Embassy Suites By Hilton Orlando Lake Buena Vista Resort,4,"Orlando, Florida"
Every wall is Instagram worthy,"Come here with your camera ready. Every wall here will make you gasp, stunning works of street art on display. Come here for the afternoon and be sure to stop by panther coffee for some real coffee.",Date of experience: October 2018,Wynwood Walls,4,"Miami, Florida"
Business in the Bay,"I had a bay facing room which has no balcony, but has an incredible sunrise view. Quite lovely spacious rooms with and extremely comfortable king size bed and pillows. By far the biggest television I've ever seen in a hotel room!!! The location is perfect, if you wanna see downtown Miami. $10 uber gets you anywhere you need to go. We walked to American Airlines arena for a Miami heat game one night. The pool area is nice and I spent some time in the hot tub. The staff are incredible Junior, made us feel warm and welcomed. He was extremely courteous and made us feel at home. Thanks Junior The pricey breakfast buffet is larger then you can handle, or at least for me it was. All the American classics, piles of cheddar and bacon, made to order eggs and waffles, fresh fruits and so many kinds of breads. We made sure to start our work day with multiple servings of breakfast.",Date of stay: October 2018,Miami Marriott Biscayne Bay,4,"Miami, Florida"
Romantic Anniversary Getaway of a Lifetime,"We spent 3 nights here for our ten year wedding anniversary. The photos on T.A. and it's website do not do this hotel justice. The pyramids are quite literally a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Pay for the room with a view, if you are staying here you do not want to miss out on waking up with the pyramids outside your window. Nothing in the world can compare. The staff at the hotel went above and beyond everyday. I forgot some feminine hygiene products and I asked the staff for directions to a drug store, so I could go buy myself. But the lovely lady at the front desk assured me that they would be happy to help, and they ran out to the store to pick up the pads I needed... One night during Ramadan we were stuck late at night, about 3kms away from the hotel, We had tried, with no luck, to hail a cab/ uber for over an hour. So we called Marriott Mena House and they sent us a taxi cab to bring us home. Tip: Ramadan is an amazing time to travel to Egypt... don't listen to all the warnings. The breakfast buffet every morning was the best I have had in Egypt, the backdrop is also nothing short of dramatic. The restaurant serves up some amazing Indian food, one of the yummiest meals I've eaten in Egypt. You truly feel like royalty staying here. The rooms are rich and textiles plush. The bed and pillows and linens were devine. The room has a romantic sensual feel. The whole grounds are perfectly kept and the pool area is stunning. If you are considering a massage book it in advance as far as you can, they didn't have a female masseuse the day we decided we wanted a massage. :( Overall I would come here again and again to feel like a visiting queen from abroad.",Date of stay: July 2018,"Marriott Mena House, Cairo",4,"Giza, Egypt"
Scuba pros,"We scuba dived with this club during our 5 days in Dahab. Great team of people, we had a great time. They brought us to different dive sites around Dahab, arranging everything. Choose these guys!",Date of experience: September 2018,Octopus World Dahab,4,"Dahab, Egypt"
Scuba Retreat,"I wanted a place in Sinai that didn't feel like a scuba dorm. So we ""splurged"" and stayed here for 5 nights. The bed and pillows were very comfy, the air conditioning and refrigerator worked very well. You can hear the waves if you open up your door. One night we slept with the door open and just the mesh curtain drawn, it was an incredibly refreshing sleep. I liked that the hotel wasn't in downtown Dahab, the taxi only cost about 30 pounds and the hotel will happily arrange that for you. The service here was great. All the staff made you feel extremely welcome and relaxed. Breakfast buffet was simple but a has everything you need to start your day. Yes the shower is salty-ish, but most places to stay in Dahab also have salty tap water.",Date of stay: October 2018,Dahab Paradise,4,"Dahab, Egypt"
Mixing Business with Pleasure,"I spent 3 lovely nights here during a conference and I enjoyed my stay very much. I had a view to the city/mountains, it was glorious to wake up to the amazing view from the 17th floor. The room's furnishings and design sparkle, everything felt clean, fresh and new. The entire vibe of the hotel is elegantly cool and mesmerizingly relaxing. The staff were incredible they were some of the best most trustworthy individuals I've had the pleasure of meeting on any of my trips. They made us feel like royalty! A special thank you to Miguel and Thali..(sorry for spelling that wrong) you really made my stay special. This hotel is in a great location for my first time visiting Barcelona, beside a huge mall, 2 minute walk from the beach, 1 hour walk to the Sagrada Familia... I took a 10euro cab ride to it and then I walked back :) The hotel's breakfast was delicious with many local delicacies and all the familiar ones too ;) My only observation is that the breakfast buffet in the later hours 9-11 felt a little understaffed so the service was slow. We weren't in a rush so we didn't mind too much.
Overall one of my favourite hotels visited to date. Thank you Hilton Diagonal.",Date of stay: April 2018,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,4,"Barcelona, Spain"
Stay here,"During my trip I was in 4 different countries and stayed in 4 separate hotels and this one was my favourite. The rooms felt brand new and clean, very modern and pretty big. Super comfy bed with perfectly fluffy feather pillows and duvet. Bathroom small but hey this is Europe. It had the best blowdryer I have ever seen a hotel. The shower had a huge, ultra modern, rain showerhead.
The location is ideal, minutes from the train, mall, canals and sights. Utrecht is less then 20 minutes by train to Schipol Airport. The friendly staff gave clear directions with a map that was easy to follow.
Breakfast was good, I wanted a fried egg but no waiter came to the table. I was hoping also for some filter coffee but didn't find any. Everything was super fresh, so many delicious fruits, huge variety of juices, yum strawberry juice... I didn't know that was a thing! Best yogurt I have ever had in a hotel and many delicious cheeses. Automatic coffee machine was... Ok... Contact Smit & Dorlas asap for a better machine. The breakfast was yummy and busy. I loved my stay and I would go back.",Date of stay: May 2018,NH Utrecht,4,"Utrecht, The Netherlands"
Too short,"Stopped here for about 10 hours, my colleague and I landed in Dusseldorf and made the quick walk over. We were pleasantly surprised at how close it was to the airport. Big beautiful rooms, very comfy bed, feather pillows and duvet were clean and comfy. The large bathroom was sparkling and decorated superbly. Wish I had more time to spend in the big tub. Bonus: the blow dryer was far more superior than most I've seen!
Breakfast was yummy with so many choices. Thanks for a good nights rest and a great start to another busy day.",Date of stay: May 2018,Maritim Hotel Düsseldorf,4,"Düsseldorf, Germany"
Great location,"Clean hotel right in the center of it all. The old city just around the corner with shopping and tons of food and night life. The hotel itself seemed newly renovated, the staff we kind and helful. The roof restaurant has some great views. The room itself was large in size with a modern style and everything felt fairly new. The bed was firmer than I would normally like but still comfy, the pillows and blankets were lush and feathery. I loved the large walk in closet. The bathroom was spacious and clean, with great water pressure, no tub but a lovely shower stall.
I wish I could have stayed longer. This is the perfect place to rest after a long day of sightseeing in the city.",Date of stay: May 2018,Z Executive Boutique Hotel,4,"Bucharest, Romania"
This is What You Need,"This place was so cozy and really captured the relaxed local mountain vibe right in the heart of the city. Just a quick walk, 5min, from most of the sightseeing spots, old city, golden roof, the Inn- river, many churches, the arc, shopping, train station, the list goes on and on. I wish I could have stayed longer. The room I stayed in was finnished in warm woods and made it feel like a cabin but the ceilings were high, so it gave the smaller room a lot of light with its huge interior facing window. The beds were small, I was traveling solo on business but the room had two small seperate, single beds, they were very comfy and clean with feather pillows and duvet. The breakfast felt a little DIY, but I managed. I had to hunt down a waiter to find the filter coffee. They have a delicous selection of local meats and cheeses. The staff were warm and welcoming and let us check in early after our long trip to get there. This place is truly a great place to come home to after a day of busy sightseeing.",Date of stay: May 2018,Hotel Central,4,"Innsbruck, Austria"
Vacation Special,"My husband and I were on a diving vacation in Eilat and chose to eat here one of the nights. The Shuk Dagim was designed nicely and reminded me of our vacations to Greece, so it had a relaxing laid back atmosphere. I took the seabream oven roasted as our friendly waiter Yarden reccomended. The fish was extremely flavourful and was the tastiest sea bream I have ever had. I also adored the bounty of salads that came with it. Overall a lovely experience and not pricey. Really worth the value. Great service, delicious food and a lovely atmosphere! What more do you need! Go here! Don't miss it! Thanks Yarden for making our visit a memorable one!",Date of visit: March 2018,Fish Market - שוק דגים,4,"Eilat, Israel"
Accommodating,My husband and I celebrated my Birthday here because I am a carb-aholic but the menu was filled with delicous complex pasta dishes. I am a very picky eater so I explained to my very accommodating waiter my likes and dislikes and we were able to make a dish that suited my preferences. Most places aren't so understanding and willing to change the menu for an adult child who doesn't like broccoli... But Avi was great! We had a lovely experience. The pasta was so fresh and cooked to perfection! I would go here again.,Date of visit: March 2018,Pastory,4,"Eilat, Israel"
Regular Asian Food Bar,"My husband had a strange visit to this place. I felt that they had crammed way too many tables into the floor seating so I was uncomfortably close to the table beside us and my chair kept hitting the ladies behind me. The food was yummy the flavours were good. But I am not too sure why it's the price it is, I'd say it's only mildly overpriced. The waitress dropped a bear bottle on the floor and cut my husbands toe so they gave us our appetizer free... My husband also forgot his phone in the restaurant and they held onto it for us untill we were able to come back to get it... Talk about an awkward night. Overall good food, great people but tight seeting arrangement cheapened the atmosphere.",Date of visit: March 2018,Ginger Asian Kitchen and Bar,4,"Eilat, Israel"
It doesn't get more authentic!,"Want to taste Italy? Looking for authenticity that can't be faked?
Go here! Order a meat and a cheese platter with a bottle of Amarone, and find your favourite pasta, the carbonara was to die for. Not joking! This was the best restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of dinning at, ever! I was only in Milan for 5 days on bussiness and this little gem was reccomended by an Italian friend. If you are in Milan go here! We did twice!!! Oscar we love you!",Date of visit: November 2017,Ristorante Da Oscar,4,"Milan, Italy"
Feeling posh in West Hollywood,"This hotel fits the vision of what you think hollywood should be; glamourous, and expensive. The staff were amazing, friendly and chatty. It says free wifi here on trip advisor but I was surprized to find out that meant only by the pool or in the lobby-not in the rooms- which was honestly annoying. You can charge $8 for 500ml of water but you can't put free Wifi in the guests' rooms?
The facilities were stunning; designed to perfection, clean and well maintained. Overall pricey; my one breakfast cost me over 40USD! Too rich for my blood!",Date of stay: January 2018,W Los Angeles - West Beverly Hills,4,"Los Angeles, California"
Big and Cozy,"I was in Foster city for bussiness and stayed here for 3 nights. My first night we had an 4.3 earthquake, so the hotel is earthquake proof- that's good!
The facilities themselves were well kept, I loved that there was an indoor pool and hot tub! Yay! The Wifi was free and strong through out the hotel! YAY!
The room was very large, the beds and pillows were very comfy, I slept very well here.
Foster city if you've never been has nothing much going for it other than the high tech companies that have moved there.
It takes about 35+ minutes in really good traffic to get to downtown San Fransisco and costs about $40USD in an Uber to get there.",Date of stay: January 2018,Courtyard by Marriott San Mateo Foster City,4,"Foster City, California"
Bussiness with a View,"I enjoyed my 4 nights there in the tinest hotel room I've ever seen. The room was small but comfy and clean. The bed was luxurious and large complete with many fluffy pillows.
The view was remarkable facing the Thames and its location is prime for the bussiness district. But with lots of history surrounding there was so much to see and do.
I enjoyed the heated bathroom floor feature and the robe and slippers that came with the room. They even had a European and an American electrical outlets, convenient because I only had one adapter for all of my devices.
The breakfast was lovely with many types of breads, cheeses and meats. I did find the food to be the freshest earlier in the breakfast service than later.
Over all a pleasent stay with good wifi connection and staff that go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable.",Date of stay: November 2017,The Tower Hotel,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Did the Job,"My team of 8 people stayed here for a conference. I had the opportunity to stay in two rooms during my stay. First room was on the main floor which I shared with a coworker was styled in Italian 1980's fashion was tiny and echoed the subway station underneath quite clearly. The room was small and dark but felt clean. The bed was very firm and the pillows were very thin. The second room I stayed in was on the second floor and was large enough for a small family. It was bright with huge beautiful windows. You could still hear the subway but just barely. The bathrooms both had a funky looking bidet soap that became somewhat of joke to my entire team. Beware the of bidet soap, it looks like a forgotten science project that none of us were brave enough to use.
We were here on bussiness attending a 5 day conference at Fiero Milano, so this hotel's location was excellent because it was only a few stops away.
I loved the breakfast it had cold cuts no hot meats but lots of cheeses, yogurts, fresh fruits, even freshly sqeezed oj and unlimited coffee.
The staff were pleasant and helped me print some emails.
I'd stay here again for bussiness but wouldn't be my first choice.",Date of stay: October 2017,Mokinba Hotel Montebianco,4,"Milan, Italy"
Quiet and Quaint,"During my recent trip to Cologne, my colleagues and I spent 4 nights here. We all agreed that the beds were extremely comfortable. Bathroom was small but so clean; I loved the towel heater. I had a room facing the road and I had no noise problems. The breakfast buffet was tastiest when it first opens; it was yummy with lots of choices; bread, croisants, meats, cheeses, muesli, cereals, fresh fruit, juices and lots of coffee. The staff were courteous and kind, helped us order taxis and gave good recommendations around town. The hotel is located near the forest, the perfect place for a nice peaceful walk through nature. Over all simple but clean, comfy and cozy.",Date of stay: September 2017,Novum Hotel Silence Garden,4,"Cologne, Germany"
Fishing Adventure,"My husband and I saved this excursion for the last day on our four day trip. We booked through the faliraki beach activities booth. 35€ and we were picked up at the beach by Sergio, at 12:00. The fishing vessel was an authentic fisherman's boat, large enough for probably 8-10 people to fish comfortably. We however were very lucky and had the boat to ourselves . Sergio was a friendly local fisherman with the patience and know how, to help us remember how to fish. The last time we fished was over ten years ago so we were a little rusty. Sergio helped us prepare bait, untangle our lines, and give us tips and tricks for success. We spent over 3 hours in a few different spots and wound up catching a bunch of fish! (See our final catch in photo) Afterwards Sergio brought us to his friend's restaurant where they cooked our fish for free, we paid only for the salads and drinks . It was an incredibly authentic experience and it was the highlight of our trip. My husband and are pretty relaxed and laid back people and this fishing trip was a relaxing, fun adventure that we will never forget. Thank you Sergio!",Date of experience: November 2016,Sostis & Saratonga Faliraki Fishing Trips,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Snorkel Paradise,"Make sure you go up to the look out to capture Anthony Quinn's complete beauty. This place is stunning from every angle. My husband and I spent an afternoon here, where the boats appear to be floating in the air, the water is that clear. But we were there later in the season when waters tend to be their clearest and the tourists are fewer. While snorkeling the waters we're filled with large schools of sea bream and many other smaller species. Here we also spotted a squid from the shore. Stunning location recommended for the snorkelers out there!",Date of experience: October 2016,Anthony Quinn Bay,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Authentic Romantic Getaway,"My husband and I wanted an escape to paradise so we stayed in the executive suite at Kouros Exclusive. It was the best value for money I have ever received from a hotel. The room was absolutely breathtaking, the bed was huge and extremely comfortable, open concept bathroom was straight out of a magazine, which had a rain shower head and seemingly endless hot water. Our room also had a Jacuzzi on the balcony.
Hotel grounds are tidy and beautifully designed, with a stunning saltwater, infinity pool.
The staff were extremely warm and accommodating, they really went above and beyond to make sure we were enjoying our stay. The breakfast was fresh and delicious and filled us up each morning before heading out for a day of adventure. I would most certainly recommend this hotel, I would definitely return.",Date of stay: October 2016,Kouros Exclusive,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Self Guided Snorkelers,"My husband and I visited here for the second time by ourselves. Last time we took a tour group, and I am so glad we rented a car a drove from Faliraki this time. A completely different experience without having to be limited by time contraints. The city itself is pretty tourist trappy probably the most expensive place in Rhodes. But it's stunning and always worth a visit. We snorkeled for hours in the bay which had some interesting fish and bits of red corals. The sand is beautiful and soft and we enjoyed the views while laying in the sun.",Date of experience: October 2016,Agios Pavlos Beach,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
