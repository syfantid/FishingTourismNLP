Best boat tour on Santorini!,"Friends of ours booked this tour. When they called and gave us the description of what they had booked it sounded amazing. It turns out that you could never properly describe this tour in words - it HAS to be experienced in real life in order for you to understand just how amazing it is!

The combination of authentic Santorini fishing history, with a trip to the extinct volcano at Palea Kameni and all the sights that come with that, with amazing seafood and accompanying Greek salads, as well as all the beer and wine you can drink (and believe me, Captain Kyriakos will make sure you drink!) means that this trip makes the standard boat tours seem so basic in comparison. I challenge anyone to finish all the food that is put in front of you - it’s almost impossible!

And if you are a fan or music, and Greek music in particular, then this tour offers you something I guarantee you will never find from any of the other tour operators on the island. Father Kyriakos, son Antonis and mother Sveta are a family team who go above and beyond to ensure you step off the boat knowing without a doubt that you will carry with you memories that will last a lifetime. The tour ends with a special sunset surprise that I won’t mention now as it is amazing to experience without knowing what’s coming. Let’s just say that Antonis is a master of his art, and he entertains you in a way that leaves you with goosebumps, and photos and videos that will make all of your friends supremely jealous.

In summary, this tour is run by Captain Kyriakos, a Santorini legend, and his amazing son, a maestro in his own right, along with Sveta the matriarch, who can’t do enough to please the guests. Really, the only reason to choose a different boat tour on Santorini is if Flora is already booked. The memories will last long after your memory card is lost or deleted, and you can’t say that about many experiences these days.",Date of experience: September 2020,Flora Fishing Tours,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Brilliant beach break,"With sweltering weather predicted we were lucky enough to secure a booking at Colson House for a weekend getaway. It was our second time staying here and it was better than we remembered. We were given the Four Poster Room, and we slept better than we do at home. John and Billy are brilliant with recommendations of things to do and places to eat, and Kemptown beach is at the bottom of the road. Colson House is perfectly located for exploring Brighton, and it’s easy to see why we met other guests who are also regular returners, we wouldn’t stay anywhere else in Brighton.",Date of stay: August 2020,Colson House,5,"Brighton, United Kingdom"
Birthday snorkeling trip,"My girlfriend and I took a half day trip with Tobin to celebrate her birthday. Tobin collected us from our villa in his 4x4 and took us to his shop to complete he paperwork, and then it’s a short stroll to the beach and his awesome boat. Definitely NOT underpowered. We hopped on and were off.

Tobin has lived on Koh Tao for some time so knows the island well and so knows when is the best time to get to certain snorkeling spots.

My girlfriend was not a confident swimmer, and started the day snorkeling with a life jacket, which is not easy. At the second spot she went in without the jacket, following Tobin, or was it the other way round?!?! We both saw so many different types of wish, and were lucky enough the see the bait ball phenomenon. Tobin has hinted that he might find it, but didn’t give it away until it was there in front of our eyes. Amazing.

Can’t recommend Tobin highly enough. What an amazing day - a birthday to remember for sure.",Date of experience: January 2018,Extreme Academy Koh Tao Water Sports Centre,5,"Koh Tao, Thailand"
