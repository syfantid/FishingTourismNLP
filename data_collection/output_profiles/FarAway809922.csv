Mythos at Milos.,We always go to Milos when in Skala beach. When Andreas is there he opens in the evenings and there is always good food with good music. I love to have a Mythos or two there when at the beach. We have been visiting Milos since 2008 and it’s bee favorite of ours ever since.,Date of visit: September 2020,Milos Restaurant Bar,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Either the others writing,"Either the others writing the bad reviews have been unlucky or we have been lucky in all our visits to the Bull. The food has always been good. We have never had an issue with the service. We used the online app tonight and everything came in a reasonable time. The food was good , and service was good.",Date of visit: September 2020,The Bull Restaurant,1,"Otford, United Kingdom"
Always amazing,"Lovely rooms spotlessly clean. Lovely pool cleaned every morning by Costas who made sure the job was done even though he was suffering badly with back pain. Lovely food cooked by Maria with her home made marmalade and fresh eggs, fruit and vegetables from the farm. Sia is always around to make sure everyone is happy, and they will all do everything then can to make sure your stay in Kefalonia is the best. The lovely Irene is never far away with a lovely smile and lovely family. Pelagos is such a great place to stay. Once you have been to Pelagos you will want to return that’s for sure. They work on the apartments through the winter. Not a year goes by where the apartments are not painted and something is changed to meet Sia’s keen eye for detail in maintaining and upgrading various items as and when she can. Sia has many dreams for Pelagos and each year she makes a change to get a little closer to what she has planned. We have seen many little changes and some big ones over the years. Allot of work goes into running Pelagos. Much of it out of season. This year Poppy was a great asset, always smiling, always entertaining.
The rooms were cleaned daily to a very high standard and the cleaner was always busy but had time to say hello.
It’s been a difficult year for everyone this year but the three weeks we spent with the family were the best of 2020.
We look forward to seeing you for the best two weeks of 2021 as well and hopefully the world will be a better place.
Thank you Pelagos.
Thank you Costas, Maria, Sia, Irene, and Poppy.",Date of stay: September 2020,Pelagos Apartments Skala,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
80’s wekend,"The rooms are just ridiculous, the response to these posts seems to be a standard response since Tripadvisor first started. We had three radiators two of which barely heated the room and the one which worked well did so until it fell of the wall while we was out on the first night. The fixings holding it on were not suitable. The shower only worked after playing with the dial to get it to go hot and the holder was broken. The door didn’t close so with three people showering one after the other the water was in the living area. One key per room is not great when others want to get in alone. Some areas look like a cloth hasn’t touched them since it was built. These reviews mean nothing, nothing seems to change. Is it because they don’t care, the cleaners/ maintenance people do not do their job properly , or the management are just not up to doing the job. Maybe they are just clinging onto a job knowing that realistically it should be knocked down.
So let me predict the reply if there is one.
You are saddened to read about our recent stay and you will pass the comments on to management so this can be improved for future guests.
Maybe management can’t read! Or just don’t care.",Date of stay: March 2020,Pontin's Camber Sands Centre,1,"Camber, United Kingdom"
Birthday celebration,"The food was very enjoyable but there was confusion between the six of us that although we ordered as couples most small dishes were for one so we had to have half a skewer each or re-order so the other person could have a portion. We didn’t feel this was very clear but it wasn’t a huge problem as it didn’t take long to get the food.
We would go back as we all enjoyed the food.",Date of visit: January 2020,Robata,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Pre and after theatre drinks,We popped in for a drink before a show. I left an item there so we returned after the show and the barman returned it to us. It’s a very small friendly bar and we had a few drinks more than we planned. Great little pub,Date of visit: November 2019,The Compton Cross,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Afternoon tea,"Another great couple of hours spent gazing over the city of London with great service. Nice sandwiches, cakes and scones with a glass of champagne.",Date of visit: November 2019,Ting Restaurant & Lounge,1,"London, United Kingdom"
5th visit in 4 years,"We love Shangri La The Shard.
We noticed a few minor changes this year. No way to play music in the room this year and a few other small differences. But overall we still had a great weekend. The in room dining menu is now much more extensive which is a bonus. We have booked for next year and can’t wait to get back. The staff as always are very attentive and the view is just as amazing.",Date of stay: November 2019,"Shangri-La Hotel, At The Shard, London",1,"London, United Kingdom"
Great food,"There is no denying that the food here is very good. We have had Chateaubriand on both occasions and it’s been cooked perfectly.
Tables are a bit crammed in and on both occasions we have been sat extremely close to adjoining diners which is the only thing I can say disappoints me about Roast. And from speaking to others we are not alone in that thought. So one star dropped for that reason. Food and service was very good.",Date of visit: November 2019,Roast,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Come From Away,"This show is just grips you from start to finish and is absolutely brilliant!
An emotional roller coaster of a show.
Truly outstanding!",Date of experience: November 2019,Phoenix Theatre,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Group visit,"This place is beyond belief. Look at all the replies saying they will
Pass on the comments for future reference. It takes more than passing on comments. Picking up a broom and mop would help for a start. The rooms are filthy. My son’s bed had food crumbs in it. The floor was sticky The general dirt was just not acceptable. And obviously this has not changed in years. The rooms look like they need knocking down. Filled holes in doors that look Like they have been filled by a two year olds with play dough. It’s just a dirty run down place. There is no consideration for any other guests as people are allowed to sit outside there rooms talking, shouting, playing games and making general noise until the early hours keeping other guests awake. Can you believe that electric is actually extra. Maybe a clean rooms is extra?
The worst accommodation I have ever stayed in and no comments form the management are going to change this.
My suggestion is don’t bother because they obviously don’t.
No business deserves to exist under these diabolical conditions.",Date of stay: July 2019,Pontin's Camber Sands Centre,1,"Camber, United Kingdom"
Not up to the usual high standards,"We are fairly regular visitors to Shangri-La The Shard. We first tried afternoon tea last year and was very impressed. We decided to take the family this time as a birthday treat for my son. We arrived a little early. The seat was great and as requested. The sandwiches were ok but the wait for them was nearly an hour from sitting down. Last year the service was perfect and just flowed as it should without being intrusive. We then asked for some more sandwiches plus some ham with no mustard for my son. We again had a long wait for the sandwiches and then had to wait twice as long for the ham without mustard and the bread wasn’t as fresh on those, and by the time they had arrived we had moved onto sweets. So as always the view is great. But @ £277 for 2 adults and 2 children the food and service was not up to par on this visit. Staff were friendly as always but it just wasn’t as good as before as we have come to expect. However we are back for the weekend later in the year so we may try again , we will see.",Date of visit: February 2019,Ting Restaurant & Lounge,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Fantastic,I cannot recommend this show enough. It was amazing! We had the Ultimate experience which we didn't realise was £45 each and only purchased one ticket ion advance. We had to buy another one. The snacks are minimal and I would suggest they double up when there are two of you as I can't see them giving half a bowl for one? But with two half bottles of champagne and chocolates plus a separate WC's avoiding long queues it made the day that bit more special. But as I say they could do a little more regarding snacks.,Date of experience: November 2018,The Lion King,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Our 5th visit and re-booked for next year.,"I have not found fault in 5 visits now. We had a small room issue this year. It was resolved in 5 minutes of reporting it. The room was amazing. The staff are amazing. Can't wait for our next visit.
Thank you for another great anniversary weekend!
See you next year!",Date of stay: November 2018,"Shangri-La Hotel, At The Shard, London",1,"London, United Kingdom"
Very good!,We had a fantastic meal here. The scotch egg was really nice to start. Followed by Chateaubriand which was cooked just right. Then home made desert to finish. The food and service were great.,Date of visit: November 2018,Roast,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Home form hime,"I say it’s like going home, but it’s not really as it’s much better than home. Which is why we have been back every year since 2008. And will continue to do so. We have adopted Maria, Costas, Irene and Sia as our Kefalonian family , well if they like it or not they have no choice. Nothing is ever too much and Two weeks is never enough.
Yammas!!",Date of stay: August 2018,Pelagos Apartments Skala,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Great place , great family!","We love Kaliva, great for breakfast on the way to the beach and great for an evening meal. We have been going to Kaliva for many years , before they moved to their new location with a wonderful view. It’s a family run business and such a wonderful friendly family at that. Always there to please. Always great food. What more could you ask for.",Date of visit: September 2018,Kaliva Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Another great day,"This was our second trip and we once again enjoyed a great day with great food, company and scenery.
Well done!",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Very poor,"We booked a family adjoined room for convenience to start out holiday off in a pleasant way. It went wrong from the start. First downside was the building Work in the hotel which meant the main bar was not accessible which is a feature of the Hotel.No mention of this inconvenience when we booked or any reduction in cost. We checked in at 2pm. We entered one room only to find someone asleep in the bed of the other room!
We were moved into a room with pretty run down decor. Nothing in the room bar. We ate in the small restaurant/make do bar and was amazed at the cost of what was extremely overpriced and average food.
When we woke in the morning we noticed we had left €2000 and four passports in the original room. The front desk said they could not help us with out a previous room number as the computer system was being undated and the system was down. Can you imagine the stress when flying on a family holiday three hours later. Eventually we worked out the room number and our stuff was found. £425 for one night in what I would have described as no better than a Holiday Inn.",Date of stay: August 2018,Radisson Blu Hotel London Stansted Airport,1,"Stansted Mountfitchet, United Kingdom"
Very over rated,"I didn’t find any dish to be exceptional, and to be honest at those prices they should be. For a start the fat in Crispy duck should be rendered down, not soft and thick in places making it unpleasant to eat. Service was ok but not the friendliest waitress. I guess they are popular for location and not quality of food.",Date of visit: March 2018,Hutong,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Birthday treat,Another great visit to Shangri la. Always friendly and welcoming. I just can’t just £40! for two drinks in the Skybar though. Will give that a miss in future. But the view in Shangri la never changes and the staff are great.,Date of stay: March 2018,"Shangri-La Hotel, At The Shard, London",1,"London, United Kingdom"
Very average,We visit London on our wedding anniversary and make a point of trying a top rated chinese one night of the weekend. The food was quite bland compared to all other restaurants we have visited. The bill however was amongst one of the highest. It’s been ticked of the list but a return is not planned. Disappointed to be honest as we had high hopes. Maybe back to Kai’s next year.,Date of visit: November 2017,China Tang at The Dorchester,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Amazing,"Just can’t get enough of this place. The staff are polite and helpful. The views are the real draw here though and we keep returning.
The rooms are nice, maybe they need to get in top of a some little maintenance jobs like tile grout missing and cracked tiles. But that’s a small observation. Great place!",Date of stay: November 2017,"Shangri-La Hotel, At The Shard, London",1,"London, United Kingdom"
Fantastic,"This is our home from home In Skala. This is where our lovely Greek family live and we cannot wait to visit. Unfortunately 2 weeks at Pelagos is never enough! We love Kostas, Maria, Sia and Irene. They make our stay in Kefalonia even more amazing than possible. We cannot recommend Pelagos high enough. 12 holidays and everyone as amazing as the other. We love you all xxxx. Carry on doing what you do so well and you work so hard to make sure your guests are happy.
Bravo!",Date of stay: August 2017,Pelagos Apartments Skala,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Cannnot fault in any way,What a great experience with a great family. We were greeted by Antonia for a light breakfast with Greek coffee. Then we went out to retrieve the 2km of net they put out the evening before. We had an assortment of Scorpion fish Red Snapper and various others. They sorted through the catch and made a lovely fish soup with lemon and fried Red Snapper with fresh vegetables from their garden and washed down with family made white wine. Dinner will change depending on the catch which makes it more interesting watching the net come in. The trip the day before had 8 Lobster! The food was amazing. We got plenty of time for swimming before and after lunch as well. Another annual holiday must do for us.,Date of experience: August 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Valentines meal,I can't fault anything about our meal tonight. The service could not have been better and the food was fantastic. Can't wait to go back.,Date of visit: February 2017,The Little Garden,1,"Sevenoaks, United Kingdom"
"Amazing , love this place!","When we first arrived for our second visit the Premier city view room we were given seemed to have a much smaller window area than that of our deluxe city view room the year before. We just didn't get that wow factor when we entered. I returned to reception and explained my concern. He did a room check and offered to show us another room. As soon as I entered the new room I got that wow factor back. I'm so glad I asked for the room change as was close to staying put. We did notice that our room looked into the bathroom of the adjoining room which was a minor issue so beware! Our new room was amazing like last years but bigger. The view was across to the wheel etc. The bed was huge. We had room service just so we could stay in and look out of the window (it was also November 5th) We have just got back and booked again for next year as it's become the best possible place to spend our wedding anniversary each year. We have upgraded again to an Iconic City view room. We have put a room request in for a bath with a view and one of the higher floors so lets wait and see.
The staff cannot do enough to make sure your stay is a memorable one. This has to be the best Hotel in the UK. Where else can you just not wait to get back to your room and become a hermit for the weekend (apart from the odd meal out and West End show)",Date of stay: November 2016,"Shangri-La Hotel, At The Shard, London",1,"London, United Kingdom"
Dissapointed,"This was our second trip which was chosen again for our wedding anniversary meal after a great meal last year. The food was very good but the ending was disappointing. My wife and both counted the money left for the bill payment and infact I am quite OCD so counted it three times. We handed in the payment and proceeded to leave. My wife was then pursued across the restaurant by a waitress calling out that we had underpaid! Not wishing to make a scene and to be honest it was our word against hers I just paid and left feeling let down and disappointed. We were both not wrong and as I say it was checked and checked again.
Not the evening we was hoping for this year.",Date of visit: November 2016,Hakkasan Hanway Place,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Great service,"The food was very good with a good menu. The staff were very attentive. The only downside on the day we visited was it happened to be the windiest day of the holiday so wasn't ideal regards location but that's irrelevant to the review, I just suggest you go on a clam evening as it's open to the elements. Great food and great service!",Date of visit: August 2016,Kelari Taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"The odd negative review, really!","So the weather is bad, let's put the accommodation down. Read all the other reviews and you will see that Pelagos, and everything that goes into it which is lots of hard work from a great family, is fantastic. I realise that everyone has a right to review and their opinion, but really! The weather is bad , no atmosphere! Costas, Maria, Sia and Irene work very hard to make sure people are happy and nearly everyone is, as the reviews show but you just can't please everyone in this world!
A 1 star rating is not deserved in my opinion and the atmosphere is what you make it!
Unfortunately they cannot make the sun shine but if they could they would!
Next there will be complaints about pebbles on the beach
Keep it up Pelagos see you next year",Date of stay: August 2016,Pelagos Apartments Skala,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Good food,One of the only restaurants we have visited most years for 9 years and they don't recognise us or at least welcome us like they do which really means allots and keeps people coming back even more .,Date of visit: August 2016,Manolis Taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Charlie Brown,We have been having breakfast here for years. We had two great evening meals there this year. The Kefalonian meat pie was the best I have eaten. The owners are always very friendly and the new waiter is entertaining. The view is also great! Can't really ask for much more.,Date of visit: August 2016,Kaliva Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Was looking forward to this but left disappointed.,Service we found to be quite poor. My son was not given a knife and I had to ask two members of staff as the first one just carried on taking orders leaving my son picking at his food for 10 minutes after it was served. The ribs tasted ok but for 15€ I would expect fresh ribs rather than what I think came out of a bag with sauce like found in UK supermarkets. So very overpriced for what is essentially a cheap fast food option that could actually make a huge difference if cooked well in house and then maybe be worth the €15.,Date of visit: August 2016,Burgerata,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Ok,"I ordered a medium Rib Eye which came out well done, i sent it back and the next one was cooked ok but was just a plate of gristle.
The kids had lemonade to drink which was basically soda water so we sent them back.
No-one ever asked if our meal was ok at any time during our meal.
Not great!",Date of visit: July 2016,The Bull Restaurant,1,"Otford, United Kingdom"
Weekend in the woods,"This place is great. Kids absolutely love it. Camp fires allowed and you can hire a grill that rotates and is height adjustable for cooking all your food. Jacket potatoes dropped into the fire before you start, wine in the cool box and what a great weekend had by all. They have a small shop that sells water, fresh free range eggs, sweets and crisps. Plus bags of fire wood. The owners are very friendly. The WC's are composting so although not the most pleasant they are kept clean and if found dirty it's usually because someone has used them incorrectly. Clear instructions are on the walls. The bushcraft and woodcraft sessions are well worth it. My son made a parachord wrist band and loves it. It's as close to true camping in the woods can be with the added bonus of a few facilities and some great walks through the woods. Highly recommended.",Date of stay: July 2016,Badgells Wood Camping,1,"Meopham, United Kingdom"
Easter Break,We have been meaning to this restaurant for years. The food was very good. The main course portions were very large in comparison to UK portions. The starters were more what we are used to. The food we had was very good. Would definitely go back.,Date of visit: April 2016,Chinese Dragon,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely place to visit,"The view on the way down to Assos is amazing.
It's a lovely little village with some nice taverna's.
Take your camera!",Date of experience: August 2015,Assos,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great photo opportunity,"This is a lovely beach to head to for a day out if you have a car.
It does get busy and the sea can get rough on occasions. This is one of the most photographed beaches in Greece.",Date of experience: August 2015,Myrtos Beach,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
The view!,Remetzo is in a great location near the port of Poros. If you sit outside around the back the outlook is amazing. Somewhere to just drink coffee and gaze out between the rocks into the ocean!,Date of visit: January 2016,Remetzo,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Xmas Eve,"Had a nice family meal tonight. The food and service was very good. We had Squid, satay Chicken and scallops to start. Then Giggling beef, another beef dish with thai herbs and chicken with cashew nuts.",Date of visit: December 2015,Giggling Squid Sevenoaks,1,"Sevenoaks, United Kingdom"
