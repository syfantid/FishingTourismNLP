What a day!!!,"Not much to say about this day except... Absolutely perfect!!!
The entire boat was for us and hosted by this beautiful couple that gave us the complete experience of what we were looking for.
Nikos the captain knows everything about those islands and where to go to make you spend a perfect day for fishing, discovering nice spots for swimming and show you some breathtaking places ; can’t forget about madame also, Frosso who’s a really good chef and knows how to host you perfectly.
Well, if you pass by Milos don’t hesitate go to this place you won’t be disappointed that’s for sure.",Date of experience: October 2020,Milos Fishing Experience,5,"Milos, Greece"
