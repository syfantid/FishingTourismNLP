Great Fishing Trip and an amazing BBQ,"At the end of May 2019 we were guests on the boat of Captain Manolis. We were together with 3 other guests of different nationalities. It was a fantastic afternoon. The group was perfect and very pleasant. Quite a lot of fish was caught. The captain was always helpful in catching the hooks and handling the fish. Enjoyed a fantastic barbecue and a delicious cold beer at the end of the afternoon. The boat trip was very nice, given the opportunity to swim in the clear blue sea. Highly recommended .
