Best pizza in kalamaki,We visit tazies every time we go to kalamaki. Great pizzas and gyros. Would recommend for a cheap tasty meal.,Date of visit: August 2019,Tazies,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Massive portions,We had a great meal at puzzle. The portions are humongous and tasty. Make sure you go when you are really hungry. Nice atmosphere.,Date of visit: August 2019,Puzzle Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Amazing,I booked this trip for me and my son for a bit of bonding while on holiday. What a amazing day we had giorgias was very informative and a pleasure to be around. We learnt about how they fish and stopped of for swimming while the nets was out. We ate our catch and was absolutely beautiful if you have one trip in zante make it this one.,Date of experience: August 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Soooo good,We went in after a recommended by a friend. Was so good. Ellie worked as a waiter and seen the bad food leaving the restaurant so decided to start her own and put a effort into the meal. Really nice food and staff,Date of visit: August 2019,Ellie's Place,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Restaurant,I enjoyed our meal at the restaurant very good food and staff was very nice. What I didn't enjoy was the fact that the owner assume we only ate on the main Rd and no one gave the restaurant a chance as people are just sheep. I went to a restaurant of the strip and had to wait 30 mins for a seat took us a 20 min walk. They was nowhere near the main strip. People will come if you are good. Good luck,Date of visit: August 2019,D & B' S Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Getting very repetitive,We have been to pandesia at least 5 times and always on the Greek night. The last time we went was our worst time if I was a first time visitor it would be a 3 star. The bill took 40 mins to come after asking 3 times for it. The food was average and again took a long time to come but we expected this as we had been to Greek night. We wanted to leave but we couldn't as we never received the bill. It not all negative the staff are absolutely brilliant and do entertainment the customers but for us it was exactly the same as every other Time. The Greek dancers are very good and entertaining and don't push u getting up. The guy at the front door is absolutely lovely and very appreciably. The best staff member.,Date of visit: August 2019,Pandesia Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Back to roots,What a amazing guide and tour. I have teens who easily get bored but they loved this trip. So informative. The best trip in zante. Worth every penny.,Date of experience: August 2019,Nefis Travel - Private Day Tours,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Amazing window and views from the tower,Visited the minster on the york pass and paid a extra Â£5 to climb the spiral staircase to the top of the tower. Great place to visit. Didnt get to do the guided tour as was a bit restricted on time but wish i had as i would of learnt a lot more about the history of the minster. The stained glass on the east side is amazing and i was in awe stood in front of it.,Date of experience: November 2018,York Minster,1,"York, United Kingdom"
Race over to f1 karting,"Great track, great prices, great karts. We was staying in kalamaki and walked over to the teack from our hotel even though you can get a free transfer if you call them. The karting was really good i had a 300cc kart while my 12 year ols and 13yr old had a 160cc kart. I really recommend this place. Amazing couple of hours spent in the afternoon. Good cafe on site as well. If going with children i recommend befor 8pm.",Date of experience: August 2018,Formula Zante Go Kart,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Gr8 band shame about the venue,"Went to see the killers at the macron. What a absolute joke. Having been to over 200 gigs i would say this is the worst venue i have ever visited the toilets are disgusting, the queues were unbelivable to get a drink at a rip off price. It really did put a downer on what should of been a special night. They are too small to do a gig on this scale. Small club mentality. I would never return even if it was free.",Date of experience: July 2018,University of Bolton Stadium,1,"Horwich, United Kingdom"
Bar is a joke,I often come here to wait for my daughter while she attends a club nearby. The waiting time to get a drink is a joke they are always understaffed on the bar once waited 15 mins just to order 1 drink. The staff look like they are ready to sling themselves on the m60 next to it,Date of visit: June 2018,Toby Carvery,1,"Oldham, United Kingdom"
Avoid ordering tzatziki,This was our third visit to the restaurant and has really gone down hill. Service charge added to the bill which i never get in a restaurant as i cant serve myself i would gladly tip good service but i have to pay a service charge for bad service. Food was average service was rushed and miserable. Extremely over priced. I will not be returning which is a real shame as greek is my favourite cuisine.,Date of visit: May 2018,Rozafa,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
