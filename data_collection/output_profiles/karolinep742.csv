An authentic and amazing Greek boat trip ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡·,"Hello from the Norwegians.

My fiancÃ© Sam and I booked this boat trip as our wedding present to one of our favourite friends :) We wanted to book a whole day trip with authentic Greeks and authentic Greek foods and views. And that is exactly what we got!

Antonia, Michalis the boat captain were absolutely amazing hosts and company throughout the whole trip! The trip started with the crew picking up the nets of fish. After that the boat travelled quite a distance to get to a quiet location near a beautiful beach with cliffs and a gorgeous view. We got to swim for a long time around the beach and boat, and the water was so warm and delightful.

Then we were served beautiful starters (Greek style bruschetta), and after a while we were served a full main meal consisting of lobster, fish, spaghetti, Greek salad, Greek potato mash and beautiful local white wine.

Throughout the whole trip the crew made sure we were informed of all the sights and fun local facts about the island. The crew were really good with mingling with us, but also give us some space to eat and space when needed.

The married couple could not have been happier and more pleased with the gift, and kept saying throughout the entire trip how amazing the trip was!

We could not have been more thankful, amazed and grateful for the trip, and want to thank the crew once again!

We definitely recommend this trip highly! One of the most amazing things to do when visiting Kefalonia

All the best and greetings from Norway,

We had been driving up from Stoke that day and were looking forward to eating Southern American food, but did not realize the extraordinary food we would be served!
