Fabulous little baa!!!!,"What an amazing little pub!! So quirky & inviting!! All the staff were brilliant, from the many many tempting craft beers/lagers & ciders to the fascinating rooms upstairs.....(dare you to stay in the “doll room” for more than 5 mins)?!! We had a fabulous time & the live music from Robbie Reay was a real bonus!! Amazing duo!!! Most definitely worth a visit & just off the Main Street too!!

Fabulous Food & Amazing service!!!!,"WOW!!! the moment we set foot in this lovely cafe/bistro we felt at home!! A warm friendly welcome, glowing log burner & fabulous menu to tempt us!! Have to say Katie is a gem!! She is so enthusiastic & genuine & certainly knows the food, describing in detail the ingredients in the salads & how the pizzas are made with the freshest produce....(we hope Enzo is ok after his little incident tonight) however the arrival of Robbie in his Superhero cape saved the day!!! Well done Guys!! Food exceptional, wish we weren’t heading home tomorrow or we’d be back.....",Date of visit: October 2019,The Smith,4,"Windermere, United Kingdom"
Delightful!!,"From arriving at this lovely country pub to leaving for our walk back to the Wombleton caravan park (exactly 18 minutes each way) we could not have had better service, delicious food & lovely drinks! The 2 ladies at the bar were so friendly & helpful, the food (once decided on) as there was a good choice from the main menu & the specials board of locally sourced produce was excellent. The Malbec perfect & instead of a dessert we opted for a Local G&T....again perfect!!! The ambience & surroundings made it a wrench to leave!! We’d definitely recommend The Plough!! Thank you!! (Sorry no photos of food as we were too eager to eat)",Date of visit: October 2019,The Plough Inn,4,"Wombleton, United Kingdom"
Fabulous little restaurant!!,"Where do I start?? From the moment we arrived we were so well looked after, we sat outside on the patio as it was a warm evening & were quickly presented with a menu where we wanted 1 of everything!! We plumped for a lamb & a chicken dish after the mezze which was a meal in itself, cannot fault anything, service efficient & friendly, food beautifully cooked & so tasty, we’ll be back!! Definitely recommend Az!!! Thanks guys!!",Date of visit: August 2019,AZ Restaurant,4,"Scarborough, United Kingdom"

Lovely beach bar!!,"Fabulous bar with sunbeds for daytime use & perfect for pre-dinner drinks & snacks & meals!!

The food is very good & the waffles delicious!!",Date of visit: August 2019,Nemesis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Absolutely FABULOUS day!!,"From reading reviews prior to our holiday, this trip was a definite!! The very BEST boat trip!! 8am depart from the harbour returning around 3pm.... perfect day assisting bringing in the nets & helping (if you wanted to) remove the fish, returning some to the sea, learning the names from Efi & identifying the huge variety. Our 1st swim stop at the “mud bath” beach (it didn’t provide eternal youth unfortunately) gave the crew time to prepare & cook our haul.... delicious, served with Efis salads & plentiful wine & beer!! Another swim stop after seal spotting & a cruise down the coast before return.... we can’t praise this high enough!! Dimitrios & Efi are amazing hosts & we’ll be back!!!",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fabulous!!!!!!,"A favourite of ours in Katelios!! Fabulous food (& plenty of it) freshest Greek salad of huge proportions, kebabs & meat platter delicious, we had take away gyros & chicken pittas on numerous occasions & meals in the garden restaurant. The waitress was so busy but always had time to chat & was so welcoming, wine good too!! A must when visiting Katelios!!",Date of visit: August 2019,Tsobos Garden Grillhouse,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Definitely recommend",Date of visit: August 2019,Captain Jerry's,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Fabulous setting, will definitely return!!","What a perfect setting!! Peristera apartments are set in beautifully tended gardens full of Oleander & Pomegranate bushes, Olive trees & manicured grass... the pool area is spotless with plenty of sun beds & surrounded by stunning views of the hills. The apartment we had, no 5 had a very comfy bed, lovely balcony overlooking the pool & the sea in the distance. The apartment was very clean with plenty of storage & a small but perfectly adequate bathroom with shower, clean linen & towels approx every other day & Spiros on hand to help with any queries! We had a kettle & fridge with sufficient cutlery etc for sandwich making only but wouldn’t have used any cooking facilities as the tavernas in a Katelios are plentiful & excellent!! It’s about a 15 min stroll into the village/ beach with a small supermarket & bakery 5 mins walk away.... we absolutely loved our stay at the Peristera & can’t recommend it enough!! An excellent base for exploring the island (we hired a Quad from Kostas at Venus, just near the supermarket) thanks Spiros, Sandra & Kevin",Date of stay: August 2019,Peristera Apartments,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fabulous home from home!!,"What a fabulous base for a holiday in Mauritius, we travelled all over the island from Jackie’s lovely home in Souillac, she is a wonderful host, the flat is immaculate, 3 beautiful bedrooms, huge family bathroom with washing machine (very useful), very well equipped kitchen, comfy lounge & dining area with sole use of roof terrace with fab views, loungers, roofed seating area & bbq!!! Quiet area, 10 mins walk to GrisGris beach & 5 mins from supermarket, stunning beaches only 10 mins drive...Jackie can arrange car hire too & offers breakfasts & home cooked meals if required! Could not have been happier here, definitely recommend Aurelia Lodge!!",Date of stay: December 2018,Aurelia's Lodge,4,Mauritius
