Alexander the poor,"We went there because it had good reviews which was useful because it was a stones throw from our hotel, but it must have been an off night.

I can only credit the ambiance, really, because both the service and food were rubbish. We had Moussaka in Paros and it was superb but here they must have swapped out the mince with some sort of dog food! The “BBQ chicken” wasn’t so great either and seemed like it was cooked hours before and then reheated for service. The taste was dry and would stick to the top of your mouth and the outside looked like it had been left in the fire.

Service wise it wasn’t great too. Nobody knew what the other one was doing and they’d congregate at the entrance discussing WTF was going on, right in front of our table. The Chuckle brothers would have done a better job.

Not a great night guys!",Date of visit: September 2019,Alexander the Great Greek Restaurant,4,"Athens, Greece"
Great way to explore Milos,"Having spent most of our time exploring the island via ATV (quad) and scooter we decided to set sail with Captain Andreas and Pedros (who were great!).

The boat is small and there were only 7 of us on board (inc. crew) but it made the trip far more interesting than if you were on a boat of 40+.

We visited 4 secluded parts of the island (that you can only access via boat) which were beautiful and, because of the pebbles/small rock beaches/coves, the water is so clean and transparent.

True to their word food was served up and alcoholic/non-alcoholic drinks were provided (Andreas makes a mean spaghetti and shrimp pasta!).

Thanks for the trip boys!! Here’s a few photos ;)",,Explore Milos with Poseidon®,4,"Milos, Greece"
Mum knows best!,"Family run restaurant offering the best in homemade cooking. Mum and dad operate in the back whist the rest of the family work front of house. The food is rustic and the service authentic. We had the moussaka, amongst other things, and it was one of the best we’ve ever had. We finished the night with baklava which was just amazing (better than anything you buy prepackaged). Portions are served as if they came form a platter or straight from the stove.

Superb! It doesn’t need to be anything more, really.",Date of visit: August 2019,Taverna Geromanolis,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Best Ramen I’ve Had This Trip,"There’s plenty out there, but for me, this place served up the best Miso Ramen. It was friggin awesome !",Date of visit: May 2018,Ramen KAIRIKIYA Kawaramachi Sanjo,4,"Kyoto, Japan"
Authentic Italian,It may be small (probs doesn't sit more than 20) but it doesn't get more Italian than authentic thin based pizza and organised chaos. Reminds me of being in Italy. Great food and great people. That's all I have to say about this place,Date of visit: May 2016,Il Buco,4,"Byron Bay, Australia"
Great Vibe & Large Portions,"Went out for birthday celebrations and we managed to book a table for 5 at late notice #winning. We had 5 mains (seafood is great), two entrees, twice beers and a bottle of wine. Total cost $260. The service wasn't half bad either.",Date of visit: September 2015,Fish On Parkyn,4,"Mooloolaba, Australia"
Breakfast of Champions,"Can't fault the place. Quirky, rustic and great for breakfast. I'm someone who like to have a substantial feed before the day ahead; so I went for the 'Huntsman'. Sausage, hoc ham, mushroom, egg, halloumi cheese, the lot!! Needless to say I left feeling very full and very satisfied. Great place to eat.",Date of visit: September 2015,The Velo Project,4,"Mooloolaba, Australia"
Beachfront breakfast for the win!,"Great food and great view (that's if you are lucky enough to sit outside). Breakfast on the beach front doesn't get any better!

Busy morning, but the staff here look after you very well.",Date of visit: June 2015,Bistro C,4,"Noosa, Australia"
Rustic Deliciousness,"You can feel the hustle and bustle of the cafe as soon as you walk up to the entrance. The staff are quick and efficient and the chef's knock up rustic deliciousness! The atmosphere is energetic as people prepare and discuss for a big day ahead. The demographic is mostly young; couples, families and friends. Really nice place to start your day.",,Elk Espresso,4,"Gold Coast, Australia"
Great day out but park opens at 10am,"Young children will love it! Parks and rides don't actually open till 10am (which is a shame) so no benefit in getting there super early.

Still, a great day out with some super rides.",Date of experience: March 2015,Warner Bros. Movie World,4,"Oxenford, Australia"
Would Do It Again,"Despite being a little late to our lesson, Luke (the instructor) was more that accommodating for us. The lesson was informative as much as it was fun and I’d have no hesitation in booking another lesson.

There is also the fact that - after a lesson - you can keep hold of your board for the rest of the day for only $20 - a bargain!!",Date of experience: February 2015,Go Ride A Wave Noosa - Surf Lessons,4,"Noosa, Australia"
