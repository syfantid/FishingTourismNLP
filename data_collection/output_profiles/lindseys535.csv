Right next to train tracks,"The hotel is fine, but it is right next to a set of train tracks which can be heard from most of the rooms. There is free parking which is nice, but it is still about 20 minutes away from downtown. It was also under construction during my stay, which could be heard from our room as well.",Date of stay: December 2017,Hampton Inn Memphis-Poplar,1,"Memphis, Tennessee"
Complete waste of time and money,"The description on the website does not match the actual event. I thought we would be going to haunted places on our walk, but we really just stopped on street corners and heard ""scary"" ghost stories about other areas of Chicago. And you don't get anything free for your $25. You have to pay for every drink, and you only have time at each bar for about half of a drink so most of the time you are chugging your drink to run to the next street corner to hear about a scary place on the other side of town. Also, this is minor but the bars we went to were just sports bars that were empty except for us.",Date of experience: October 2017,Nightly Spirits,1,"Chicago, Illinois"
Sunset tour,We did everything listed for the experience. It was fun. Got to cliff jump. The only reason I'm not rating it 5 stars is that I didn't know there would be 2 people to a kayak at the time and there was a lot of people on our tour. We made it back just before sunset though.,Date of experience: May 2017,X - Adventure Sea Kayaking,1,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
NOT CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT,"I looked at 3 different websites about this hotel and all of them advertised close to the airport 5km 10 minutes or less. It takes at least 20 minutes, there are no bus routes and to take a taxi is 35 euros flat fee.

We selected this hotel because we had a 20 hour layover in Athens and wanted a cheap close place. Not the case.

That being said it is definitely a cheap hotel. The usual uncomfortable beds, and pillows but my only real complaint was the ants on the beds.",Date of stay: May 2017,Kiani Akti,1,"Porto Rafti, Greece"
More of a food tour,"I selected this trip because we wanted to go deep sea fishing, but the only fishing we did was collecting the nets on the boat. After the initial disappointment we really had a wonderful time. Efi and Dimitrios were very kind and helpful. Efi prepared a delicious meal of Greek potatoes with the fish we caught in the nets. We swam at a beautiful beach and got to talk to learn a lot about what it is like living in Kefalonia as a fisherman.

So this isn't really a fishing tour, but more of a food and culture tour on the Ionian Sea. With that in mind, this was a really wonderful experience and should definitely be on your list of things to do!",Date of experience: May 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
