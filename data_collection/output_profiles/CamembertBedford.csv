Wonderful day with my son fishing,Firstly Dimitrios the owner and Captain of this boat is a super host and very kind and thoughtful with his guests. You couldn't want for a better fisherman to take you out. The boat is lovely and clean and not too big to be impersonal and not too small to feel cramped. We chartered the day for just my son (6 years old) and I to go out and rod fish and Dimitrios was great with him. Showed him how to fish an helped him. We stopped for a magical swim at a cave on the way back and made superb memories. he 32 fish we caught we took to a local tavern a I had the chef cook them. This was one of the best days of our holiday. We will be back. Make sure you do this trip!,Date of experience: July 2019,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Best resturant in the area,"Costa and Helen are wonderful hosts and passionate about food and service. The menu is excellent and punches above its weight. If this was in London it would be five star and you wouldn't be able to get a table for months. Every dish is made with fresh local ingredients, the sauces tasty and the presentation faultless. Go here to be amazed and wowed, there is nothing else like this in the immediate area. It is excellent value for what you get. Better that Alamar next door which is more expensive. Don't be put of by the tables being back from the road, go up the drive and you will be made very welcome. Our favourite place to eat in Koukounaries.",Date of visit: July 2019,Cookoonari,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Bit too corporate,We ate here more than once as it was near our hotel but that was only for conveinience. Meals good but expensive overall. You can find more authentic options near by if you look with equally good fresh sea food dishes. Fine if you like linen aprons and uniforms. It can feel like your in any air port departure lounge in the world which is a shame. The cocktails are very good!,Date of visit: July 2019,Alamar,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Poor service let them down,"These guys work hard to get you in and then in our experience dont follow up with good service. We had to ask for drinks, cutlery and four times for the bill to several staff who were clearly distracted by the next new table comeing in - they just want the business and dont care about you. Felt impersonal and rude!! I wouldnt eat here again. Food was plied high and cheap. Ideal if you have lots of mouths to feed but dont expect much personal service or recognition.",Date of visit: July 2019,The Big Bad Wolf,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Family run hidden gem,"Do not miss this place. It's tucked away off the road and you need your eyes peeled to find it. But make sure you do. Look for the little tale with a menu on it at the beginning of the avenue of palm trees. Family run hidden gem with Papa in the kitchen (he like a rice beer if you send one to him). Mama and the kids serving. Excellent traditional dishes, really family friendly and welcoming people. You wont leave here hungry. Don't miss this place.",Date of visit: July 2019,Ilias Orchard,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Lovely local taverna,We ate at Strophilia several times whilst staying locally. Superbly prepared traditional and some international dishes. Tasty and good value. Really helpful staff and nice atmosphere dining outside. We'll be back!,Date of visit: July 2019,Strofilia,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Wonderful sand,Spent two days on this beach with the family. Perfect sand and wonderful shallows for swimming and games.,Date of experience: June 2019,Highcliffe Beach,4,"Highcliffe, United Kingdom"
Superb lunch,Popped in on the off chance - an amazing village pub with a superb menu. Been seriously invested in and is now a top destination. We will be back. Best pub in the village if not the immediate area. Not to be missed.,Date of visit: August 2019,The George Inn,4,"Maulden, United Kingdom"
Not a quiet place to stay. Service patchy. All in all a dissappointing hotel and experience.,"We booked this hotel for a week as a treat for our 20th wedding anniversary for a final week of a special three week long holiday package with Virgin from the UK (cost £10k). Things started to go wrong when we arrived to book in and after queuing at Reception the lone very hassled member of staff announced we had no reservation with them. He did manage to find us the last room in the hotel (room 808) but it had none of the special requests we made (balcony and quiet spot, potentially high floor) because they had no booking. We were grateful he could find us a room but as that had no reservation for us from Virgin they had no record of our requests or liability to give them to us. The room was OK, bit tatty, furniture dated, inspection panel hanging down in the bathroom, AC very loud and old that sort of thing. But it was clean, the beds comfy and the linen nice. Not four star level in my mind. May be OK for a US domestic market but not four star UK level. It was very noisy with much sound from neighbours to each side, above and below, from the corridor and from the pool and bar outside. I think its just the age of the hotel and its construction. Virgin confirmed, when I called then first thing the next day, that our booking was emailed to the hotel and followed up with a phone call to confirm our requests. The hotel had failed to put our booking on their system. Virgin were great and negotiated $100 credit to our service bill and waived all Valet parking costs. The hotel sent up a bottle of fizz and some strawberries and Virgin sent a hamper to our home address as they could not offer us any where else at Daytona to stay. This was all fine and we decided to put up with the poor room and noise, and make the best of it, until the room above us was occupied by someone with a dog that ran up and down the room all the time (including at night) going thump thump thump! I then looked at the hotels own website which encouraged dogs and offered dog based package discounts. Yet again not what I'd expect from a four star hotel. Knowing that we had an issue with noise and that we had our reservation missed by the hotel I'd have hoped they would have proactively moved us when the new guest arrived above us to avoid any further disappointment. They didn't. I went to Reception and asked if any other rooms had become available with a balcony on an end or top floor since we checked in three days ago (as per our original request). They said a good room was free (room 417) and we could move to it. But I had to ask! It was a great room with a balcony and terrace to the side at the end of the corridor with no one passing. I would recommend you only stay in these room on the side at the end. There was still noise from below and above but it was much less. The food was very nice indeed, except for the weekend breakfast buffet which was poor and the service levels dropped as it was very popular. The pool was always crowded and popular thus noisy and difficult to relax. I wouldn't stay here again which is a shame as the location is superb.",Date of stay: June 2017,The Shores Resort & Spa,4,"Daytona Beach Shores, Florida"
#1 thing to do in the world!,I bought a half day tank driving and car crushing experience for my wife's birthday as a surprise. It was incredible. Todd and Nick are amazing tutors and such nice guys. The tanks were so cool and my wife loved every second. The car crush at the end was superb. Highly recommended and worth every penny of the £495 price. Do this - you won't regret it!!,Date of experience: July 2016,Tanks-Alot,4,"Helmdon, United Kingdom"
Hurtigruten MS Kong Harald,"What did I expect the experience on board a Norwegian coastal ferry service to be like? Well, if like me you main experience of ferry transport has been cross channel, as a family in your teens, years ago, then your expectations would probably be a bit low to be honest. This is definitely not what you get! As a business Hurtigruten has had a successful financial turn around resulting in an investment programme in their ships interiors and customer experience and it shows.
I travelled on the MS Kong Harald named after the current king of Norway, a seasoned sailor himself. The bar is named after the Norwegian polar pioneer Fridtjof Nansen, while explorer Roald Amundsen lends his name to the café. The top deck offers great views of the astounding landscape gliding by, whether you choose the sun deck, the observation lounge or the panorama lounge.
The recent refurbishment has transformed the public areas in places to an eclectic mix of a traditional Norwegian home with wall hanging plates and pictures, rocking chairs, sheep skins, classic Scandinavian designed lines and colours, right through to the cutting edge reclining chairs in the huge panorama lounge with charging points a plenty to for your devices as you catch up with news, update your status with the amazing images you’re taking real time or Skype the family and show them what they’re missing whist you enjoy world class refreshments and food!
Its almost impossible to describe in words the serine feeling of relaxing in a panorama lounge recliner, gazing nature struck, at the early morning mist clinging to the Fjords stony coast line as tiny white village houses and churches cling to the steep green slopes of the snow topped mountains as life literally drifts by silently reflected in the clear crisp blue waters. Or the rush of excitement as your hear the Captain’s announcement for the Northern Lights, jumping out of bed, pulling on your clothes, ascending to the observation deck, being hit by the cold night air and above witnessing the swirling, sky wide, display of green and yellow celestial mists. Too feel so close to nature in so many ways whilst surrounded by such memorable and well appointed accommodation is very rare indeed.
Not only have Hurtigruten upped their game on the interiors and cabins appointment (mine felt contemporary city crash pad meets boutique hotel) but the food offering across the ships different dinning options is well worth a mention. With the Norwegian Kitchen theme maximising the use of locally produced, raised and caught foods in the menus the food never failed to surprise and impress. Mussels, langoustine, salmon, herring, spider crab, sea bass, divine desserts, reindeer, succulent beef, mind bending array of breakfast combinations and lets not forget the indescribable Stockfish or beer flavoured ice creams! All served by friendly and smiling staff with skill and courtesy in surrounds akin to a Belgravia cafe bar or restaurant.
Needless to say this was no ferry trip. No way Jim Bob! This is the only way to sail the sea. Hurtigruten has a unique offering that should propel them to global leisure and exploration cruising domination!",Date of experience: April 2016,The Northern Lights Hunter,4,"Tromso, Norway"
Unmissable. A MUST!,Couldn't get our 3 3/4 year old to leave! An amazing attraction with very helpful staff. If you go to Stratford don't leave without visiting the MAD Museum :-) really fun for all ages.,Date of experience: June 2016,The MAD Museum,4,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom"
Lovely relaxing time,"Super variety of butterflies. Relaxing waterfall, plants and tiny birds. Very special place. Probably the best butterfly attraction I've ever been too.",Date of experience: June 2016,Stratford Butterfly Farm,4,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom"
Castle theme park,"Warwick is superb if you want to amuse the whole family. Here you're able to get a castle fix by climbing the towers and battlements. A garden fix in the peacock gardens. Things for the kids to do in the new horrible histories maze, princesses tower and the scary dungeon. 19th century room sets and country house experience in the weekend tea party and great hall. Top tip - search out the all you can eat pizza and pasta in the basement fir good value family feeding! But if you want a true more authentic castle experience go to Kenilworth Castle near by in stead. Warwick is good as a 'castle theme park' which is what you'd expect from the owners - Merlin.",Date of experience: June 2016,Warwick Castle,4,"Warwick, United Kingdom"
Ace premier inn,"Really sick and span. Staff very helpful indeed. Walking distance to sea life centre, numerous pubs etc and beach just over the road. Stayed here to visit adventure island. It was perfect. Food downstairs great value. Stayed with wife and three year old in their cot on one room. It was ideal. Very quiet at the back of the hotel.",Date of stay: September 2015,Premier Inn Southend On Sea (Eastern Esplanade) hotel,4,"Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom"
Superb Indian!,Went here last weekend on a Saturday night. Its a small place but was seated no problem by some of the nicest staff ever. Very good English. Food came very quickly and was superb quality and value. Cant recommend enough. I will be back.,Date of visit: May 2014,Koh-i-Noor,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Superb to cycle round,"Biked round the park one Saturday afternoon with friends. It was lovely to see so many people enjoying themselves outdoors. Nice clean city park with lots of mature trees, ponds, lakes and play areas. Brilliant for picnics and hide and seek :-)",Date of experience: May 2014,Vondelpark,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
"Amazing place, amzing locals!","This small, ancient bar is in the heart of Jordann. The décor hasn't been touched for years so if you don't like old and eclectic don't go! I went here one Saturday night with my friend James for a early evening drink before dinner and we had a blast soaking in the atmosphere and talking to the two owners and a local couple at the bar about the history of the bar, its contents and Amsterdam. We were here for three hours! It feels like a film set from an old war movie. The Gents loo is very quaint with the water flush tank inside the main bar, so you to the loo, then step back inside the main room, close the door and pull the old chain :-). The hosts were very welcoming and spoke great English. The drinks were good value and the experience priceless.",Date of experience: May 2014,Cafe Chris,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Great place for quality!,"Dined here one Sunday evening. Had a superb meal served by a waitress who looked like a young Julia Roberts. Spoke excellent English. Food was very, very good. Wine selection was superb. Great place for a special meal or to treat yourself and escape the Centre for a while.",Date of visit: May 2014,Het Melkmeisje,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
What a place! A must for everyone....,"My friend and I spent three hours here whilst the rain poured down outside, lost in the luxurious opulence of the smoking room. We purchased two superb Cuban cigars from the biggest walk in humidor I've ever been in and was attended to by two wonderful staff who kept us topped up with ten year old port and free coffee. The cigars were a bit cheaper than UK and delicious. The smoking room never got busy and was very comfortable indeed. Even if you don't smoke go in and take a look at the 1920's interior - it will blow your mind. They have an excellent high quality range of things to buy for every smoker.",Date of experience: May 2014,PGC Hajenius,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Fantastic,"An amazing dinner. Superb service, atmosphere and food. High quality and high price but well worth it. One fo the best meals we've ever had anywhere in the world. Book this as a treat but do book as they have only 13 tables and turn many people away each night who just show up. We will be back!",Date of visit: October 2013,Box Tree,4,"Ilkley, United Kingdom"
