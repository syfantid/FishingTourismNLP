2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TwisterDK2300,August 2020,5,The best Santorini boat trip,"Every time we go to Santorini we go on this trip. It combines authentic fishing, swimming, and the best seafood directly from the sea with a lot of information and knowledge about the animals.  Captain Anthi and her staff - this year Mohammed - gave us again some of our best days of our holiday. You always feel so welcome on board - and all restrictions of the Covid -19 was respected this year.  Every time it so exiting to see what's in the nets that have been set before the trip. Anthi knows every fish and other creatures in the sea and tells us with her great enthusiasm about them and answers all questions with a great knowledge. While swimming in the sea or fishing with your own fishing lines the staff prepares the catch of the day on the grill. It'll be served with rice, bread, frish tomato salad, and grilled squash - a meal which never will be the same dependent on the catch.   There might be two trips per day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon that includes the beautiful sunset.  Don't hesitate to sign up.....it's a trip you'll come back to.....anyway we do.....  …"
