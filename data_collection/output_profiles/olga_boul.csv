Expected a fishing tour and ended with an experience for live,"Without hesitation I would recommend this trip to everyone - Families, couples or friends. It included fishing, live music, sightseeing, swimming and dining. The live music by Antonis and Kiriakos was so emotional and wonderful that it touched my soul. For the dining Vetta is preparing the fishes you caught yourself before and those are accompanied on the table by other traditional self made Greek food. What impressed me the most was that the whole family gives everything to give you one of the best days of your live - and this comes out of there heart. Thank you Vetta, Kiriakos and Antonis!",Date of experience: August 2020,Flora Fishing Tours,5,"Santorini, Greece"
