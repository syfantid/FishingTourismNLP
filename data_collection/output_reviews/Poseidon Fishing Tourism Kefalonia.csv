0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nasa00,September 2020,5,Very nice trip,"Maria and Gerasimos are very warm and interesting people. There was plenty of fresh and delicious food, all made by Gerasimos. The beaches that we visited were beautiful and non-crowded. The sea was calm. We enjoyed our trip a lot and would definitely recommed it to others!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KENT_Gang,August 2020,5,The best of trips with super-friendly hosts. 100% recommended,"This was definitely the highlight of our wonderful fortnight in beautiful Kefalonia. We had the best of days; watching the fishing nets being recovered (and the myriad of different, and as we found out, tasty species), seeing the sea turtles around the fish farm, swimming and snorkelling at the White Cliffs beach and Vardiani Island (both only accessible by boat), and eating the finest of freshly caught and prepared food, all washed down with local wine and tsipouro. Maria and Captain Gerasimos were so friendly and welcoming, explaining how the food was prepared, and taking time to answer all of the questions we had about Kefalonian life. We also had the delights of Maria's very friendly young daughter to entertain us. We are a family of four including two adult, 18 and 20 year old daughters, who all thoroughly enjoyed our fabulous trip."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kizomir,August 2020,5,Great day,"I had a great time. Hosts, Maria and Gerasimos, are very kind and warm. We visit interesting places. The food was delicious, Gerasimos is excelent chef. The best day of my vacation. If you go to Kefalonia, Poseidon fishing is must see!"

4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/136arner,August 2020,5,The best trip one can wish for,"This trip is the most pleasant combination of secluded beaches, amazing  seafood, great company and unforgettable fishing experience. Small group size allows guests to get to know true locals, the nicest people you can meet, Captain Gerasimos and the host Maria. Beautiful trip, authentic experience, oh and did I mention insanely fresh and tasty food? In short, do yourself a favour and just book it."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/139ur_aa,August 2020,5,Best boat trip,It was the best boat trip we have ever had. The food was amazing and prepared with love. Maria and the owner are really warm people with a kind heart. We would reccomed this experience to all who come to Kefalonia. It was un unforgetable day.
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ariako,August 2020,5,Best day of our holiday,"Best part of our holiday! We enjoyed an entire day of sea, sun and fishing. Especially the  fantastic meal (we ate the catch of the day) that was cooked by the captain himself!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roadtrip66,August 2020,5,Super day fishing and boating,Had a lovely day! Capt and Maria were super hospitable. Was great to see traditional fisherman at work and help with the catch! You'll eat the freshest most delicious fish and prawns in the world! Swimming in the crystal clear waters is a real treat. Short sail around the fish farm was interesting and we were lucky enough to see pod of dolphins! Can highly recommend!
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/426jakah,July 2020,5,Beautiful,"By far the best and most authentic trip I've ever been on. It's a must for anyone who likes sea food, you will not go hungry (even if you don't catch much that day). An overall excellent experience, can't recommend it enough! Breathtaking view and beaches, swim to your heart's content and take a diving mask and flippers with you. May even get to see some turtles!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Isa_SDot,September 2019,5,Private tour,"Due to the late season, we were so lucky that Maria and the Captain gave us a private tour, just for the two of us. The tour started with a delicous breakfast during the way out to the sea to get the 1 km long fishing net. Some of the rare sea turtles greeted us on our way. Afterwards, the catch was inspected. The fishing net has a special size to catch the really huge and tasty shrimps. At a lonesome beach, that is only accessable by boat, we made a stop for swimming (about one hour). The lunch was prepared fresh and live on the boat.Some maybe important facts:toilette available on the boatshadow on the boat thanks to awningslonesome and lovely beaches accessed by boat (dry feet) or, if preferred, by swimmingpossibility to take a freshwater shower on the boattasty breakfast along with coffeelunch composed of the catch of the day: fried fresh fish and huge shrimps accompanied by noodles and greek salat fruits as dessertbeverages included: we were served plenty of water, lemonade, beer, wine and ouzothe price is reasonable and an awesome deal for the quality of this unique experience.To summarize, we had a lovely day with Maria and the Captain and we are happy we had the opportunity to spend the day with them on the fishing boat.

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neilo834,August 2019,5,Day fishing trip,"What an amazing family day out. So relaxed on the boat with Captain Gerasimos and Maria. We saw turtles, explored the bay and were lucky enough to see a pod of dolphins too. The captain showed us how the local fishermen fish with nets and explained all the different fish he caught. The trip was brilliant, afterwards we went to White Rock beach for some snorkelling. Then headed over to Rabbit island for a lovely lunch and drinks prepared by the Captain and Maria using the caught fish (parrot fish, red mullet, cuttlefish and shrimps). An excellent day out, learnt lots about net fishing and the area. The kids (12 & 10) had a fab time too, can highly recommend going. Really good value for money. Thank you for all the memories!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ss1252014,August 2019,5,Great experience,"I'd highly recommend this to adults and families with older children. A rare chance to learn about traditional fishing, see the turtles,  swim / snorkel on remote parts of the island on a quiet traditional fishing boat (just 7 of us on this trip) with very friendly hosts who genuinely want their customers to have an amazing experience. Thank you, some fantastic memories!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/181NeilH,August 2019,5,What an amazing day !,"If you want to see a fisherman in his local environment - pulling in the nets in and allowing you - if you wish - to help take the fish out - then cooking them along with the most fantastic prawns then this is a must trip.My wife and I joined another couple who had booked for the day - after a great traditional Greek breakfast we headed to the nets to see the catch, then on to a small beach for a spot of snorkelling and swimming while the hosts Maria and Captain Yannis prepared today‚Äôs catch - we then went to a small Island where we watched them cook the most fantastic fish stew and fried fish.We learnt so much from Maria on Kefalonias traditions, and about the island. Yannis spoke enthusiastically and showed us how everything was done - so we can try and repeat the recipes in England.After a great swim where Yannis joined us - we went back to Port completely satisfied on the whole day.I can not recommend this enough. "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robcrawfordsb,June 2019,5,Best day of our cruise!,We stopped here on a 7-day cruise. My brother-in-law found this fishing excursion and it turned out to be our best day. Yanks and Maria could not have been more accommodating. We saw sea turtles aboard a great boat. We went to a private beach where they provided snorkels for us to explore. While we played on the beach they prepared a feast from fish that was caught that day! It was incredible. Thank you Captain and Maria for a day we will never forget!
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M2056PEsarahc,June 2019,5,A taste of Greece,"A relaxing day with great people and a real taste of Greece. Fishing on the boat, releasing the fish from the nets and then our captain cooked the catch for us whilst we lay on a secluded beach! Turtles and a bit of snorkelling too.  The food was amazing, fresh & tasty.  Nothing too much trouble.  You have to try this, more personal, very traditional and we learnt something too.  Thank you Maria and Captain - we loved it! "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janrL6558EV,June 2019,5,"Fishing with the Greek, a lovely day","Five stars are not enough, such a wonderful day. Yannis and Maria take you fishing on their fishing boat Poseidon. After a hearty welcome on board, we start with breakfast the Greek style. Then we take off, on our way to the location of the nets. Maria is our host Yannis the captain/fisherman. Maria does everything to make you feel at home and tells all you need or want to know. When the net rolls in the first fish and shrimps appear, if you like you can help by taking the catch out of the net.Then we set of to a beach only accessible by boat. While the guest take their leisure in the water or at the beach, the Poseidon team prepares the lunch.And what a wonderful lunch. Our Catch from earlier reappears. Nothing but the freshest. By the time we head back for the harbour everyone is really satisfied!Thank you Yannis and Maria for this wonderful day. You are superb.If you are in to boating and like to go for the small trip on a real working fishing boat(no big crowd, not more then 10 people) you should really consider go fishing with the Poseidon, we did and what a surprise and moreover what a treat it was!!Jan, "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccaseace,June 2019,5,Five Points are not even enough for a day to remember all your life!,"If you want to experience some vey special hours with, friendly, heartwarming and nice people then you definitely need to do a trip with the Poseidon.Our day started in the port of Lixouri where the Poseidon and her captain Gerasimos and his companion and crewman panos where awaiting our arrival. After a friendly welcome they served breakfast with ""kefalonian"" feta cheese, which is one of the most tasty pieces of cheese we have ever tried, fresh tomatoes from the region, a wonderful olive oil, handmade bakery, cookies and even original greek coffee.While we were closing the meal, the captain already set course to the location where he has casted out his fishing-net early in the morning.The net was reeled quickly and a respectable catch was revealed, now it was time to remove the fishes from the net, and if you want to, you can also participate and give them a hand. But this is not an easy thing, which I experienced when I was trying to get our designated food out of the nets hooks. Fortunately and to my advantage the captain Gerasimos was very patient and gave me advice more than once.Now we had some time to enjoy a swim in the ionian sea and a bath in the sun, so the Poseidon casted anchor in a beautiful cove, where we were brought ashore in a small boat by panos. As true professionals and predictive Fishermen they also brought a sun umbrella, an air mattress a pair of flippers and diving goggles to experience the underwater world neat the surface.While we were enjoying our visit to this lonesome beach our two friends on the boat where already preparing lunch, which was served some time later while the Poseidon was lying in calm waters south of the island. They served their traditional fish soup, ""Kakavia'"" which has an overwhelming taste and freshness, a beautiful fried fish and a tasty glas of white wine. Gerasimos proofed that he was not only an experienced fisherman and mariner but also an impressive cook. During our time on this beautiful boat we had lots of time to talk to Gerasimos and Panos and to share memories, experiences and funny moments. The only bad thing of which we can report is the fact we had to leave the boat in the afternoon and to say good bye!Thank you Gerasimos and Panos, for this incredible day and for giving us an understanding of your life near and on the ionian sea. Im sure we will see us again!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardbR9672AR,June 2019,5,Boat trip with an original twist,"Idilic day began with nicely presented Greek breakfast. We then arrived at the site where Captain Gerry had set his overnight nets. It was fascinating to watch him pull these in and catch what was to become our super fresh lunch. A couple of stops for swimming and turtle spotting, all the while being informed of the area and way of life by both Gerry and Panos.  A fantastic lunch of giant prawns with spaghetti , Greek salad and then fried fish all prepared on board,  and a lovely local wine.We used both the motor and sail when possible. Captain Gerry and Panos went to every effort to make a memorable day for us. We may even try to book again before we leave - need I say more! "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisbI9075JI,August 2018,5,Fantastic day out,"Great trip! A bit of a hidden gem as they are a relatively new company operating. Geronimus and Babis are excellent hosts and made us all feel very welcome. It was fascinating watching them pull in their nets from the night before to see what they had caught, and the food they cooked up for us as a result was incredible! We also had a lovely swim on a quiet beach they took us to. We really enjoyed being on a smaller boat where the experience was more hands-on and personal. Don‚Äôt hesitate to book. "

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraceyM260,August 2018,5,Best Day,"Have to be honest going on this trip was my husband and son's idea, I went along because I didn't want to spend the day on my own! So glad I went along, Captain Gerasimos and his daughter Sissy are two of the nicest people we have ever met. The day started with a lovely breakfast, Sissy was lovely and explained everything to us. Went out to the nets, seeing them come in was fascinating and Captain Gerry (hope he doesn't mind me calling him that!) explained all the fish that was in the nets. Had a tour round the fisherery and then went to White Rock beach which was beautiful, was taken there by dinghy, had inflatables umbrella, water and a six pack of Mythos - perfect!Back on the boat was cooked a amazing meal - another confession - I don't really like fish/seafood but everyone else did so didn't think it would be a problem. There was so much food, everything that was caught was cooked, as we was the only people on the trip it was down to us to eat it all, unfortunately our youngest son was a bit sea sick so was down to my husband and eldest son to eat it all! You certainly couldn't get fresher and should have come clean and told them I didn't like fish as I felt bad for not eating! .This trip really was the best day out ever, we are going back in May with friends and hopefully will be able to go again.Thank you Captain Gerasimos and Sissy x"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariar0918,July 2018,5,BEST Excursion ever! Highly Recommended!,"BEST Excursion ever! Highly Recommended!  Captain Gerasimos was hospitable, professional, informative, and a magnificent cook on the Poseidon! As we sailed the alluring waters of Lixouri with music playing in the background, Captain Gerasimos pointed out and elaborated on the magnificent sites along the way. The boat was impeccably clean, and most of all held an inviting ambiance alongside the crystal clear turquoise water of the Ionian Sea. The Captain gave us the option of sitting in the sun or in the shade while heading to a flawless, secluded beach for swimming.After our swim in the captivating waters of the Ionian Sea, we came back to the boat and our Amazing Captain Gerasimos greeted us back into the boat with exquisite hors-d'oeuvres and the best shrimp with pasta that we ever had! My husband and I were hesitant to go on an all-day trip, but this excursion was not anything like any other excursion, the entire day was memorable from the point of when we met Captain Gerasimos to the point when we sailed back into the sunset. Thank you Captain Gerasimos for an unforgettable experience in your boat Poseidon!  Till we meet again!Eisa and Maria Shukran"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ariako,August 2018,5,the best boat trip of the island,"It is a great way to experience the ionian sea!! A day filled with amazing views, swimming, beaches you can only reach by boat and a catch of the day cooked meal by on board chef Sisi."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angeliqueorr,August 2018,5,Totally utterly brilliant!  I‚Äôd give it 10 stars if I could,"We went on a half day swimming and boat tour with Captain Gerry and his lovely daughter Sissi - with our two kids who are 8 and 5. Right from the day kicking off it was fab. We were greeted with a warm welcome at the harbour and sat down on the beautiful fishing boat to set off to sea. We heard all about Captain Gerry‚Äôs 40 years of fishing around the island. A full breakfast is provided with fresh coffee, cereal, toast, Kefalonian honey, juice and sandwiches. We‚Äôd told Sissi that our 5 year old son is animal mad so first we went turtle spotting - amazing to close down the engine and bob along waiting for the huge turtles to bob up. We saw three :)). Then we headed to the deserted and beautiful beach for swimming - only reachable by boat. The family have thought of everything - especially for the kids they had floats and snorkels and - best of all - mega inflatables. Captain Gerry also has a little row boat to take you to the shore as he wants to take you the traditional way - though you could swim it if you want to. We were there for a couple of hours snorkelling and playing in amazing clear turquoise water. After that we slowly headed back to Lixouri with the sails out. I‚Äôve been on many holiday boat trips but none come close to this authentic experience. Please go!  The best thing is that Sissi and Gerry are so so kind, especially with the kids. They are clearly so proud of the island and their boat and genuinely want to makeEvery trip special. Thank you for an unforgettable day. "
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kostasd272,July 2018,5,  Amazing experience!!!,"We had a great day with you guys. We went for fishing with nets and fishing robs.we were lucky because our catch was full of shrimps and our lunch was delicious. We went to the beach ""White Rocks"" which has access only by the sea and it was amazing and clean. I think this experience is for all ages and I recommend it to all of you..."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180graemek,July 2018,5,Truly memories made for life...,"We have been in Kefalonia for about 10 days now (5 more to go...). During that time my wife and I have packed in a multitude of activities in order to entertain our kids (13 and 1) but also to scratch our own cultural interests. The Poseidon Fishing Adventure (adventure is the correct word) ticks all the boxes and I do not say it lightly when I define the trip as one of the best family holiday experiences I've ever had. The day started meeting the boat at Lixouri harbour. The Poseidon vessel itself has oodles of charm and as the day goes on you'll come to appreciate that it reflects the captain of the ship well. Captain Gerasimos himself is a charming and humble character and definitely made maximum effort to enhance our day.After initial meet and greet we were presented with breakfast. Cereal was available for the kids and more importantly, coffee for the adults. Setting sail with a cup of coffee in hand on a sunny morning is right up there in terms of satisfaction! There was also cake, toast and bread available with a wide range of jams/butter etc.After sailing out for a bit Captain Gerasimos then cast the 1km long nets in the hunt for our lunch. The kids were mesmerised seeing the equipment in full flow and there was great excitement as tge nets reeled in. Shrimp, fish of different kinds as well as a few treasures from the deep were caught. You can pitch in to pull the fish from the nets and give a bit more interaction to your experience.When that was done Captain Gerasimos gave us a go at line fishing. My son caught 7 fish, me just 1! A great experience overall and something I'm now itching to try again.We were then taken to a secluded beach only reachable by boat. We had this to ourselves for over an hour whilst lunch was prepared for us. Inflatables and snorkelling gear were provided to keep the kids (& adults!)happy.Lunch was a joy. The fish was delicious and served with a large salad. Following this we were treated to delicious shell fish and then a shrimp/spaghetti dish. This washed down well with the white wine served. Overall I think I ate my body weight in seafood. The day may seem like a long one (8:30-4pm) but genuinely the time passed so quickly. The whole family loved it and could not recommend highly enough.Thanks to Captain Gerasimo for his hospitality  "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chichiki,July 2018,5,The best day out imaginable!,"We had such an incredible day with captain Gerasimos fishing and swimming. It really is a must do experience if you visit Kefalonia. It is such an authentic and friendly feeling on the boat it is clear that the family have poured so much love into the trips. They have thought of everything. We had brought a big bag of bits and pieces but we probably could have just brought ourselves as there was scuba gear, inflatables etc. The children were delighted. We were greeted with a buffet style breakfast to enjoy while we set off to where the nets were. After lifting the nets we did some line fishing. We swam on a gorgeous little beach that we had all to ourselves and then ate the most delicious meal of our earlier catch. This is a trip for all ages, we took our 17 month old daughter and our 13 year old son."
