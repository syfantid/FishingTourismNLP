Awesome day boating in Milos,"The best way to see the uninhabited island of poliegos, super authentic fisherman who started off picking up his nets and putting together the fish he caught in a pot for us to eat! He cooked the fish, set up a lunch with salad, fish soup and fresh fish! All served on the boat ! We saw the most beautiful beaches, swam in the most beautiful blue waters! The 2 crew members were super friendly and welcoming. A lovely experience, enjoyed by us as well as our children!
Highly recommended!",,Explore Milos with Poseidon®,1,"Milos, Greece"
Awesome !!!,"Service was awesome, food delicious. Nothing bad to say. Kids had skirt steak which was sliced for them ! We ate like kings and although expensive worth every penny. Lava cakes for desert were awesome!!",Date of visit: January 2019,Zuma Miami,1,"Miami, Florida"
Subpar service,"Super disappointed with service. We had to ask for bread several times and only got it after meal was served. Turns out there were crudités that were also not served. Would have helped our hungry kids as they waited.... Food was great especially the steak, but overpriced for experience. Many other restaurants in area have better food with amazing service. We ate at Zuma last night for example and it was an unbelievable experience. Would not go back.",Date of visit: January 2019,The Surf Club Restaurant,1,"Surfside, Florida"
Awesome après ski activity!,"My son was invited to go to this laser place after ski school, so I went along! Boys had an awesome time! They played several games, had awesome laughs, and can’t stop talking about it! The staff was friendly, the place was clean and super well organized! We’ll be back very soon for sure!! There was also a girls’ birthday party going on and the girls enjoyed it just as much!! Super fun!",Date of experience: February 2018,Mission Laser,1,"Mont Tremblant, Canada"
Things went missing from our room!!!,"I was visiting during the busiest South Beach season, Art Basel. It was also my 40th bday weekend. My husband and I have travelled the world together from China, to South America, Europe etc….Normally the US is pretty Customer service oriented. Not at this hotel. Although there was a safe provided in the room, my husband left his wedding band and watch on the dresser one morning and went to the gym…upon returning to later to the room, the watch and wedding band were gone! We were shocked. We went down to speak to the front desk: nobody seemed too concerned. After taking it further, the manager assured us the hotel's insurance would ""take care of it""…. We filed a police report which amounted to nothing in the end…. We left the hotel figuring something would be compensated eventually. We ordered a new band, and bought a watch, although the sentimental value of a wedding band after 15 years of marriage is not replaceable. Our claim was denied with their insurance. I then called back the hotel, very upset to discuss the decision. Their reasoning was it's the maids word against ours. There was no proof that she stole anything. And besides, 3 employees had apparently entered our room and nobody admitted to stealing it!!!!!! WOW. In the end we were given ZERO compensation. Not from the hotel nor from their insurance company. We were told they were not liable since there was a safe in the room. As if everything not in the safe is fair game to steal. Never have we been dismissed like this and treated this badly from the entire staff at this hotel . From the front desk who didn't seem to flinch when we told them, right down to the managers and head of security who didn't compensate with anything while we were there. No courtesy at all.
Terrible service. To add to this the rooms weren't that great, and the pool area wasn't that nice. I would definitely NOT recommend this hotel to anyone I know. STAY away unless you can get a huge safe to put all your stuff into it (laptop, etc.). Seems like theft at this hotel is TOLERATED by management.",Date of stay: December 2014,Royal Palm South Beach Miami A Tribute Portfolio Resort,1,"Miami Beach, Florida"
