Amazing experience!!,Amazing experience! The crew of mykonos sailing was very friendly and arranged a private cruise for us to Delos and Rhenia island. Our captain Vasilis took us to all the secret beaches with a super fast and new rib boat!! We had a perfect day!! A “must do” while in Mykonos!,Date of experience: July 2020,Mykonos Sailing,5,"Mykonos, Greece"
A unique experience! MUST do it!,"We did this cruise a couple of days ago. All I can say is amazing! You start the cruise by collecting the fish net (actually cpt Andreas does it). Afterwards we went to the beautiful and almost “private” beaches of Poliaigos island which are really the highlight of the area in my opinion. We stopped at an amazing beach ,all by ourselves , to swim and afterwards have our lunch: the fresh fish we just cought ( “kakavia” a tradiftional Greek soup made of fish) and tasty home made “ladenia” - a traditional kind of pizza in Cyclades-by the captains mom. This was accompanied by salad made of tomatoes cucumbers and green peppers grown by the captains dad in milos! A really special and original meal! We stopped at several beaches of Poliaigos which are extremely beautiful and have the clearest water, astonishing landscape and all kinds of colors!
At our final stop at pano Mersini beach we had home grown melon after our swim so that we would have the strength to “help” the captain throw his fishing net again in the sea :-) .
Andreas the captain and his helper Andreas , made this experience so special and unique! One of the must do of milos and Kimolos! I highly recommend this!",Date of experience: July 2019,Boat Trips-VIP/Family daily cruises in Milos,5,"Kimolos, Greece"
