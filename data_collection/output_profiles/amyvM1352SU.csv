Fantastic Day,We met up with them at the dock and promptly got on the boat and had coffee and cake. After visiting for a few minutes we were off to find the nets. They reeled in the net and we got to pick the fish out. Many varieties and sizes. After we finished the nets they motored over to a nice cove for swimming and lunch. Wonderful food! Fresh caught fish cooked to perfection. At the end of the day we motored back to the dock! It was an excellent day. Wonderful hosts!,Date of experience: October 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
