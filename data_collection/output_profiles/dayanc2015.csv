Beautiful,"Beautiful hotel and perfect location. People were very friendly, service was fast and the food and views from the hotel were amazing. 10 minutes walk from the acropolis museum and you can even walk to the acropolis as well , The Prakka neighborhood is close by and other shopping areas.",Date of stay: September 2019,Electra Metropolis Hotel,1,"Athens, Greece"
No better way to do it.,"This short tour is worth the money, when it comes to monuments and important places is better to see them with a guide, this trip is short and precise. Maria Anna, our guide, gave us all the information of the parthenon and the areas around it, we loved it.",,Athens Half-Day Sightseeing Tour,1,"Athens, Greece"
Good but long,"Good tour of Santorini, the guide was knowledgeable but the return to the pick up destination was a little bit messy and most of the drivers of the bus don't speak English so is hard to know if you are on the right bus back.",,Santorini Full-Day Sightseeing Tour,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Fun day at sea,"Amazing fishing tour, I booked it because my fiance loves fishing, the captain of the vessel was an amazing woman whose family tradition is fishing. She took her time to explain to us about the fish, the fishing methods and warned us about the poisonous fish. They cooked a great and abundant meal on board and we got the chance to snorkel and fish with a line. 100% recommend.",,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Amazing view and great service,"I loved this hotel, is true that is far away from Fira and Oia, but they are very helpful with transportation and they take you to the close areas in Akrotiri and to the bus station if you wish to go to the other villages. Amazing view wherever you stand on the hotel and the receptionist Jenny is very helpful as are the drivers. The only reason I don't give them a 5 is because the cocktail selection and food selection are not the best, maybe in the future that can be improved.",Date of stay: September 2019,Apanemo,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Amazing,"One of my favorite Holiday inn, people are very friendly, the place is always clean and is well located. 3 minutes walk to the Picadilly train station and 6 minutes to picadilly Gardens. In addition, the breakfast is quite good",Date of stay: August 2019,Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Amazing,"I loved this place, great environment, everything came to the table on time, food was delicious but most of all the waiters were amazing, my waiter Amir was very helpful and always made sure I was doing ok with my meal, I went alone but he made me feel like I had company.",Date of visit: August 2019,Tattu,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Don't stay at the hotels,"Family of 6, 2 adults, 2 teens and 2 children.

Pros: the children enjoyed the experience in the park so even though I was bored as the rides are mainly aimed for children, it made me happy to see the children happy.

The Rooms at the legoland hotel are themed and it had sufficient bed for a family of 5 to sleep comfortably in.

Cons: The breakfast at the hotel was not the best. Cooked mainly for quantity not quality.

To go to the pool you require to have an appointment and they only let you use it for one hour. If they are going to offer a service they should consider the number of people that are staying there and make a bigger pool.

The gym is very small and not enough equipment to work out.

At the park the lines were extremely long. But I guess that is the same issue with all theme parks.

The staff are very young and not helpful at all, they don't seem to know what to do and they don't always follow the same rules.

Went to buy refillable slushies but couldn't because they didn't have container available. I told the cashier to sell it to me anyways in a plastic cup, that I could save the sell voucher and return at a later time for the containers and she refused.

They gave us a room with a fridge full of old fruits and sandwiches that belonged to the previous family.

Anyways... main point. Don't stay at their hotels because is not worth it. Enjoy the park, is a nice experience for the children.",Date of experience: August 2019,LEGOLAND Windsor Resort,1,"Windsor, United Kingdom"
Good but hot.,"For a 5 star hotel all the rooms should have air conditioning. We stayed for a romantic with my fiance night and we couldn't cuddle at night because it was too hot. However the staff is very friendly, they offered a fan and the public areas are quite nice. Additionally the breakfast was great.",Date of stay: July 2019,Kimpton Clocktower Hotel,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Excelente la comida.,"Tiene un excelente concepto. Una rica comida en forma de teatro con el chef interactuando con el publico. A pesar que me gusto le doy tres estrellas por que el lugar me parecio muy deteriorado, utilizan sillas rimax y en algunos lugares sucios. Ademas la presentación personal tanto del cocinero como de los ayudantes fueron malas sin embargo la comida estuvo muy deliciosa, las porciones generosas y a los que nos gusta el humor negro los chistes y comentarios som divertidos. Si te ofendes fácilmente mejor no vayas.",Date of visit: November 2017,Teatro Magico del Sabor,1,"Cali, Colombia"
Poor,"After reading all the good comments my boyfriend and I decided to stay there. They advertise breakfast but you had to pay for it. The rooms were small only space for the luggage forget about walking, the restroom was small and the shower without a door just a shower curtain that blocked the drainage and got stuck to you body and the water licked outside. No hot water in the morning and when asked to the receptionist why she said because too many people were taking a shower at the same time. The day we left the vale parking driver left the car in the middle of the road and a mini van scratched it and it was a rental so we had to pay the company 300 € for it.
The only good thing is Sofia the receptionist she is nice.",Date of stay: April 2017,Hotel Montreal,1,"Florence, Italy"
Amazing,"My boyfriend and I went to Rome and stayed in the hotel for 4 nights it was just amazing, it's a 2 star hotel but the facilities and the service was amazing. The room was spacious, bathroom, had a HD TV with netflix and amazon TV available so we could watch movies with our own accounts. The bathroom was fully equiped, with everything you need (tooth brush, raiser, etc). And the service was amazing, they really go an extra mile to make you feel confortable. There is a service they offer and they take you to the nearest train station which is 15 minutes away from the center of rome. They sell the train tickets and they give you a map and explain to you where to go.
Cons: the guy with the blue eyes, I think is the owner should smile a little more but even though his seriousness makes him come out as rude he is really helpfull.
If I could give this hotel a 10 star instead of 5 I would and my boyfriend a 100 stars and he is a difficult man ro please.",Date of stay: April 2017,Hotel Castle,1,"Rome, Italy"
Se puede conseguir mejor por el mismo precio,"Horrible, desorganizado, mala infraestructura, te toca pagar hasta para que te den el control del televisor, no limpian bien los baños, las toallas las cambian cada 3 días, la comida es asquerosa, el bar poco surtido, el servicio es pésimo, gente grosera, te gritan a cada rato por que mojas el área de la piscina que me parece absurdo. Lo único rescatable es la ubicación.",Date of stay: June 2015,Hotel Blue Tone,1,"San Andres Island, Colombia"
