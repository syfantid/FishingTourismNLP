Great stay!,"My husband and I stayed here on the last leg of our Europe vacation. It was right around the corner from the train station which made it so convenient to get to when we arrived to Firenze. Check in was later than we arrived but they happened to have an open room and let us check in.

The room was very nice and comfortable which was important since we were relaxing more towards the end of trip.

It was also located closely to the Firenze Cathedral and the wonderful shops and restaurants in the area. This made for easy sightseeing. It was also very close to our new favorite pub The Joshua Tree Pub.

We didn’t get to attend breakfast formally due to having early tours, but were able to grab plates to bring to the room. It was tasty and filling. They also had available snacks and drinks throughout the day which was nice.

Overall a great stay and we would definitely stay again if and when we return.",Date of stay: October 2019,Hotel Alba Palace,4,"Florence, Italy"
Cretan massage!,"I had to get a massage while on the island and after talking to Stella while she gave me shoulder massage with sunscreen, I was convinced to follow through. They made it very easy to choose from and they were all friendly.

The spa was across from our Hotel, Volcano View. The manager greeted me and walked me across to the spa. While I waited for my massage with Stella, they had me wait where there were warmed stone beds that were so amazing.

For the massage, the room was lit beautifully and was super comfortable. Although it was windy outside and very noisy at times, it didn’t bother me. Stella was wonderful. She was friendly and talkative in a comfortable manner. I felt so relaxed throughout the entire massage. She was so kind asking about my heritage and sharing more about hers!

In our package I got an extra 15 minutes so I had a facial massage, which was a wonderful ending to the entire experience! Will definitely return! Thanks Stella!",Date of stay: October 2019,De Sol Spa Hotel,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Great for our short stay!,"My husband and I stayed here on the 3rd leg of our Europe vacation. The staff was friendly as soon as we arrived. The rooms are small but perfect for a short stay. We spent most of our days walking the city anyway so the size didn’t matter because we weren’t there much.

We are breakfast at the quaint dining room which was very simple but good. You have to purchase more than what’s on the breakfast bar, but there was enough there to satisfy us. We didn’t get an opportunity to use the bar but it seemed nice.

The hotel is in such a great location. We were very close to the Colosseum which made getting to our tour super simple. It was a bit farther from other attractions but we enjoyed the walking and sight seeing. Overall this was a great place for the price and the location! Would definitely stay again!",Date of stay: October 2019,Hotel Grifo,4,"Rome, Italy"
Great tour!,"My husband and I originally booked the morning tour with fishing and lunch but had to reschedule our booking due the weather. The captain was able to get us on an evening tour.

Although we didn’t get to fish as we originally planned the experience was just as amazing! They took us to the opposite side of the island than they normally do due to the wind so we missed the white sand beach which I was also looking forward to.

We got to experience them pulling in the shrimp pots and nets that would be providing us with our evening meal. Then we got the opportunity to swim in the Aegean which is a must while there. While they prepared our meal, we did get to “fish” with hand lines which was a fun little addition.

The fresh cooked fish and shrimp was by far the best part. My husband is a fisherman and a charter boat captain so we are picky about our seafood and this was just phenomenal. They provided wine and other beverages, and a yummy salad to accompany the fish and shrimp. Definitely a memorable experience. We finished the tour with getting to watch a beautiful sunset.

The crew and the captain were amazing all along the way and I recommend this tour for everyone. Next time we hope to get the morning tour!",Date of experience: October 2019,Giorgaros fishing tours Santorini,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Greece 2019,"An amazing experience! My husband and i are history nerds and loved learning all that we did on this tour. Jeannie (sorry if it’s spelled incorrectly) was our wonderful tour guide. She was friendly, knowledgeable, open to questions and took amazing pictures of us so we weren’t stuck with selfies only on this incredible tour! I definitely recommend asking for her!

The day started with a pick up at our hotel in Fira and we drove to Oia. Along the way she provided so much history and geological information about the island it was great! The cruise ships hadn’t come in yet so we got to experience Oia and the island without the crowdedness there usually was in the villages. It was so beautiful and we got the most amazing pictures!

From Oia we traveled to Akrotori and saw the ancient ruins of the first civilization. It was a bit rushed but that also was due to a bus coming in and we got stuck behind a group of 30 plus people. Then onto red beach in the same area. We were told that it’s not always safe to walk through the rocks to the beach so didn’t get to stand in the sand but maybe next time.

We then visited the black sand (rock) beach in Kamari, and learned about the area near there. I thought it was beautiful and would have loved to stay longer.

We opted for the winery instead of the observatory which was the better option in our opinion. Argyros winery is must on the island. Learning about their entire process from the vines being shaped into baskets and why, to the final bottling was great, and even better was the wine tasting. I’m not a white wine fan, but Santorini changed my mind. We do regret not shipping back wine, but we know there are distributors in the states. Along the way Jeannie told wonderful stories, answered all of our questions and was just amazing company. When the tour ended, and we were dropped off, she was so kind and inviting, stating “when I see you again it will be with bambinos!” We were so impressed by the tour and learned so much. Thank you!",,6-Hour Private Best of Santorini Experience,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Great food!,We stopped here based on the reviews and it definitely was worth the visit. We had the calamari and the pork and it was cooked to perfection! Definitely make this a must when you visit the island!,Date of visit: October 2019,MeRaki,4,"Santorini, Greece"
2nd Honeymoon Greece 2019,"Santorini was our second stop on our Greece and Italy vacation. When booking our trip, Volcano View Hotel was given to us as an option by our travel agent, and I chose it based on the reviews. I am so glad that I did because it was above and beyond our expectations in so many ways. Of course the views, implied in the name, were absolutely gorgeous and the sunsets were unforgettable. The room, 103, was right by the office which was nice, allowing us access to the road to get on our shuttles very quickly. The room was very nice, clean and had a great view along with the rest of the the hotel. We arrived on a Thursday, and they were having their final Greek Night and we jumped on the opportunity right away to be a part of the celebration. It was so much fun! My husband and I danced with the dancers and group of people during almost every song, ate so much yummy food, and got to break fun plaster plates! So memorable! The pool was cold but still enjoyable. We met so many great people at the pool that we will always remember including Sophia who worked at the bar! She was so friendly and helpful! All the staff was really great, and friendly helping us all steps of the way. They set the pool up so you don’t feel the wind as much as you do throughout the rest of the hotel. The restaurant had tasty food, and again the view, especially during break fast was great. We were highly satisfied and would definitely stay here again when we return to the island!",Date of stay: October 2019,Volcano View Hotel Santorini,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Greece 2019,We were in Athens for a couple of days on the first leg of a Europe vacation. We had the opportunity to see the Acropolis Museum as a part of an Athens half day tour. It was amazing and so much to see. We didn’t see as much as we would’ve of like being that we ran out of time but of what did see and learn about was so amazing. The ability to see the ruins underneath the museum was really great as it spoke to the pride the people are taking in finding and sharing their history. A must stop in Athens. We definitely want to come back!,Date of experience: October 2019,Acropolis Museum,4,"Athens, Greece"
Greece 2019,"Athens was the first leg of our Europe vacation and we only had a couple days to sightsee so I figured trying a half day tour would be nice and it would still give us time to explore ourselves. I would recommend to everyone having a private or small group tour as it is so much more intimate and we didn’t have to wait on the big lines. Martina was our guide and she was wonderful! So knowledgeable about every stop along the way and open to stopping if we wanted pictures or to see more. She took very good care of us and showed care and passion for the sites. We were open to what the tour had to offer and so that made it more fun and interesting. They picked us up at our hotel at the scheduled time in a nice air conditioned vehicle, and the tour was driving and seeing sights as well as stopping to learn along the way ending with the Acropolis Museum.

We both love history and this tour hit a lot of the markers! Half day that is what is expected. Although we didn’t go into the Panathenaic Stadium, it was a great stop along the way. Of course the the Parthenon and Acropolis Museum were the highlight. We had the opportunity to see the changing of the guard the day before on our own so we did not feel bad about not getting out at that stop. Although we struggled with large crowds and some other rude tourists, she made sure we saw and learned as much as possible while there. I wish we would have had more time at the museum but it gives us a reason to go back! To me there were no illusions and the tour was what they said it was! I unfortunately forgot our drivers name and feel bad but he was also very knowledgeable and made the experience very nice. Would do the tour again!",,Private Tour: Half day Athens Sightseeing and Acropolis Museum,4,"Athens, Greece"
Greece 2019,"Athens was the first stop on our European vacation. The Attalos was perfect for our 2 day stay. The staff was helpful and welcoming, and they offered a fun beverage when coming in. The small elevators made the experience more fun. The rooms were clean, the bed was comfy and the view from our balcony of the Parthenon was spectacular. My husband and I love history so this started our trip off right. It’s is in the middle of the city so it made it great for walking to restaurants and seeing the different sites! The rooftop bar had a great selection of local drinks and espresso, and of course provided a wonderful view of the city and the Parthenon. The breakfasts were so good, and they had a wonderful spread. We would definitely stay here again, and plan to in the future. Thanks for the wonderful stay!",Date of stay: October 2019,Attalos Hotel,4,"Athens, Greece"
Boat to dinner plate!,"This was our second year in Cabo, and of course we have made Captain Tony’s a must. We stopped at had food and drinks after a sailing adventure on our second day on vacation. The wings and tacos were so good and of course the drinks were great. Then after our fishing trip on Diablo Loco, the captain Juan Carlos Frias Orozco recommended Captain Tony’s, as he did last year, to cook the bonitas we caught. They did a spectacular job! It was so tasty, and so fresh. They’re service is prompt, professional, friendly and seem to be having fun serving patrons. We will definitely be back!",Date of visit: February 2019,Captain Tony's,4,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico"
Great time!,"My husband and I decided to add another fun adventure to our vacation in addition to our annual fishing trips. We booked the morning snorkeling and sailing trip! Our boat was the Mistral and we shared with 4 other couples. As soon as we arrived where it was moored, they asked for our shoes and what we wanted to drink. The captain, deck hands and photographer were very polite, professional, knowledgeable and on top of service. Before our drinks were done, they were getting us another. We got the opportunity to watch whales, on top of snorkeling and sailing which made for a full four hours and it was great. After snorkeling, we had a great little lunch of sandwiches, fruit and chips with guacamole. We got to meet a wonderful couple and one the of the deck hands that were from the same area we are from so it made for even more fun and comfortable trip. We definitely will book with them again when we return to Cabo!",Date of experience: February 2019,Cabo Sailing Ocean Adventures,4,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico"
Unexpected stay but beautiful,"We did not plan to stay at Pacifica this trip to Cabo. We wanted to stay at Rosé because it is close to the marina, where we had excursions planned, and Rosé is on El Médano beach which is swimmable. Due to Rosé overbooking their resort, even though we paid in full 8 months prior to our trip, they informed us we would be getting “a free upgrade to Pacifica”. We would be staying at Pacifica for 2 days. See our Rosé review for more of the story .

When we arrived at Pacifica, via taxi because there is no shuttle to Pacifica from the other Pueblo Bonito Resorts, they greeted us with professionalism and we very accommodating despite my irritation at the inconvenience. They put us in a very beautiful room right next to the pools, the beach and very close the restaurants. We decided to not let this change ruin our trip because it was Valentine’s Day and we needed this vacation.

Pro’s of Pacifica:
Very new and beautiful rooms and architecture. Adults only so it’s very low key. Our room had a great balcony and it was up to date. Pools were very nice and clean. The one pool at night had lights that made it look there were stars in the pool. There was a swim up bar which makes it nice when wanting a refill while enjoying the water. They had a nice hot tub as well. There was a beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean and wonderful sunsets. The scenery on site was really great and fit the desert feel. Pescados, the sushi restaurant, is where we chose to eat for Valentine’s Day. The food was great, the wait staff was prompt, professional and friendly. They even brought me a rose during dinner saying “here your husband got this for you”. It was nice. We also at Siempre, and it was very good. We had the all inclusive package so chose from those items. Other items had extra charges and sounded yummy. The restaurants were set up very nicely. The lobby bar, Partidos, was a great little hidden treasure because they made the best drinks while we were there. Peninsula has an outdoor seating area which was great from grabbing a drink and watching the beautiful sunsets. Staff at the restaurants and bars were very nice and helpful.

On Valentine’s Day they set up a dinner area you could pay extra for that had music and its own bar. Although we didn’t partake, it was fun watching the festivities. They were also hosting a wedding and it was great to see what they did for the wedding.

They had fun fire pits on the beach at night which was so nice to be warm, the wind made it a little chilly.

Con’s:
It’s on the pacific side of Cabo so the beaches are not swimmable. It’s very windy, so they built a wind barrier at the resort to help with that but it still made it a bit chilly at times. The wait staff at the pool was lacking in their service and promptness. The only bar with beer in a can was at partidos, otherwise it was on tap which resulted in warm, uncarbonated beer. Also the margarita was premixed, and not the best. The other drinks were good, especially at Partidos. It’s a 10-15 min taxi ride to the marina, and since our excursions were there it cost extra and was an inconvenience. There’s no shuttle to the sister resorts so if you want to visit you have to take a taxi. You can walk to Sunset beach since it’s close.

We would definitely recommend Pacifica to couples, friend groups, or families with no children as a place to vacation. We definitely would stay again and would love to bring our parents because of the laid back atmosphere.",Date of stay: February 2019,Pueblo Bonito Pacifica Golf & Spa Resort,4,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico"
A stay to remember,"We chose to stay here this trip to Cabo because it was close to the marina, there was El Médano beach which is swimmable, and we would be able to get to our excursions Friday and Saturday with ease and little taxi cost or we could walk. Unfortunately, when we arrived we were told after filling our paperwork that they didn’t have a room for us, they overbooked, and we would be getting a “free upgrade to Pacifica” to stay instead. We voiced our displeasure with this information because Pacifica is a 5-10 min taxi ride away from the marina. We stayed at Sunset Beach last year and this was one of the cons of staying there. With Pacifica next door to SB we didn’t like this news. The desk staff said the next availability would be Saturday if we chose to come back to Rosé. We let them know that because this was our plan initially we would like to be back. They kept saying that Pacifica was very nice and to call if we changed our mind and wanted to stay there. We said we would be back. They covered the taxi cost to Pacifica because there wasn’t a PB shuttle to or from that resort. (See our review for Pacifica on their page. ) When we arrived at Pacifica we made sure to contact our travel agent and spoke with concierge about making sure our taxi was paid for when returning to Rosé, and that our bags would be stored when we check in early Saturday. We had a fishing trip planned that day and we didn’t want to deal with back and forth travel (and cost) to Pacifica after. They said it would all be taken care of.

Pros of staying at Rosé:
Pretty resort. Great view and access to El Médano beach, one of the reasons we booked specifically with Rosé. They gave us 2 complimentary 50 min massages for the inconveniences of their oversight and overbooking. The resort is close to the marina, where we spent a lot of our time. The staff was very nice and helpful. Luz, the housekeeper, was very kind and did and amazing job when taking care of the room. The room, although outdated, was nice and we had a good balcony view. The food choices at Mare Nostrum were great. We also liked the Sunsets and Sushi Bar restaurant. We spent a lot of time on the beach lounge chairs which had a great view and the water was very nice. It was right next door to PB Los Cabos which made it nice to change up food or bar options. The spa was beautiful and Rosa and Maria were amazing during the massage. The jacuzzis in the spa were so relaxing along with the steam room and cold pool. We loved the proximity to the marina because it is our favorite place to be while in Cabo. Overall, it seems to be very family friendly.

Cons:
Rosé overbooking and creating the inconvenience of us needing to spend more money to taxi to our excursions Friday. Needing to wake up extra early to check in and make sure we didn’t lose a room again, and store our stuff. No swim up bar. Limited restaurants, and bars but it helped having Los Cabos next door.

Finally: While at the pool, although very pretty and eye catching, we witnessed an older man have an accident (poop) on himself. We understand that this happens and is sometimes uncontrollable so we do not fault this man for this. The next part though was intentional on his part. My husband watched when the accident happened and the man chose to get into the pool to clean the diarrhea off of himself. My husband told people to get out of the pool and not get back in. We watched the man shortly and he was wiping off in the pool and you could clearly see the excrement in the pool floating. We got ready to find and tell staff but then we saw staff go up to him and begin telling him to get out of the pool. He sat for another couple or so min. We thought the staff would alert others in the pool but they did not, mind you the pool is one big connected pool. Another couple we met confirmed what we saw and we saw others around him witness it. We expected they would close the pool to do a shock treatment and make sure others didn’t come in contact with the fecal matter. They didn’t right away. We decided to go to the front desk to also let them know, and as we were walking in saw the staff taking caution tape to the pool. We told front desk staff and let them know we saw it all. Though when we walked back by 5 min later, the small area where the man washed his excrement off was caution taped off and they were using a cleaning bet to scoop out what was in the pool and dumping it in the filter, but there were still people in the pool doing water aerobics and swimming. We decided to go to the beach. An hour later, the couple we met said the staff poured what looked like chemicals in the water and closed the pool for 30 min. We still didn’t go to the pool for the rest of the trip. We know they couldn’t cause a big scene but it was very unsanitary. It will definitely be a memory that lasts a lifetime.

We have had the opportunity now to stay at 3 of the 4 PB resorts in Cabo and overall appreciate the experience.",Date of stay: March 2019,Pueblo Bonito Rosé Resort & Spa,4,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico"
Cabo annual vacay,"Travel to Cabo has become a routine for us. This year, our travel agent set us up with Eliker Transfer to get us to and from out resort. We always use a private transfer to avoid unnecessary headaches trying to get to and from where we stay and we know we have a safe ride this way. Eliker kept track of our changing arrival and departure times which took away stressing about our transfer. Eliker was professional and friendly from the time they met us at the airport. Their transfer vehicles are clean, comfortable and nice. They had beverages ready for us both trips and both drivers were friendly. We will definitely use Eliker when we return and recommend them to anyone.",Date of experience: March 2019,Eliker Transfer Cabo Transportation,4,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico"
Cabo Stroll after fishing,"We recently visited Cabo for our honeymoon. One of our excursions was fishing, which gave a chance to check out a little of Cabo after we were done. We stopped and decided to have a drink here. They were friendly and the drinks were fun. We are looking forward to visiting again when come back, and even try the food!",Date of visit: January 2018,Cabo Wabo,4,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico"
Wonderful dockside fish preparation and cooking,"We had an amazing day fishing where we caught a striped marlin and mahi mahi tuna. Juan Carlos, captain of the panga were fished on, recommended Captain Tony's to cook our mahi mahi and prepare our marlin as sashimi! They were very welcoming, and talked my husband through the best way to make our meal. While we waited for our main course we ordered the guacamole. It was prepared table side and the best guac I have ever eaten. They brought the most beautiful plate of marlin and tasted amazing. It will definitely be difficult to beat when it comes to eating sashimi in the future. They served our tuna next, and it was the most delicate, and flavorful tuna. It was amazing. They cooked some in garlic and blackened the rest. I'll never be able to eat mahi mahi the same way again. The staff was great, the drinks were amazing-we got the blue marlin and iguana iguana- and the food by far the best. If you want to have your catch fixed amazingly, do it here at Captain Tony's. Even if you don't have your own fish to bring in, I would recommend eating here. We will be back!",Date of visit: January 2018,Captain Tony's,4,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico"
Private ride for our honeymoon!,"What a great experience with Luis as our driver. He was very friendly, and professional. It made the experience traveling to and from our resort comfortable and fun. I recommend their services to anyone heading to Cabo.",Date of experience: January 2018,Caboride & Transfers,4,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico"
"""Hooneymoon"" for the books!","When we arrived on the 25th of this month for our honeymoon, the welcome completely set the tone of our trip. We had the greatest experience from the beginning. We had a private car from the airport, and were welcomed like royalty. Hugo and Manuel treated us by taking us back to a different room to check in, and we were offered champagne, hospitality and an upgrade from an junior suite to an executive suite to celebrate our vacation. The room was so beautiful, and spacious. It was much more than we could've asked for. We got in after 5p so went to eat at La Nao to end the evening. It was good, but there was a lot of food we couldn't eat due to our diet restrictions. Still recommend it if you like variety and you want buffet style.

The trip continued to be amazing. We spent the first full day with breakfast in the Market, and from the 1950's diner. Food was good, the coffee was the best. We then moved to relaxing and having drinks at the Skypool. John was friendly, and made the drinks very vacation friendly! So yummy and strong. We also went to the beach which is beautiful, but due to the waves you are unable to swim. It is still worth the walk and view. After relaxing all day we decided to have dinner at Tazuna. The wait staff was very friendly but when they got busy, you could tell they were short staffed and we ended up waiting around for different orders for up to 45 min. The sushi was good, as well as the ramen. When ordering the gyoza, one order only has 2 gyoza on the plate, but they were good.

The next day we spent time at Quivira golf course, after getting yummy room service breakfast. My husband played the course, while I road along. It was so worth the time there, and the experience was so much fun. Gordon was friendly, and allowed us to bump up our tee time so that we were able to finish earlier. The course was beautiful in all of it's different views and excursions. The comfort stations were so great to have along the way, and had good drinks and food to partake while waiting on the 3 holes that had them. We had a wonderful time, and can't wait to come back and play the course again. We came back to our suite to a fun and funny surprise in our room. They created a cute happy honeymoon message on our bed with a heart made of petals and kissing towel swans. The funny part was that it said ""hooneymoon"" instead which made it that much better. We now call each other hooney. lol

We went fishing with Captain Juan Carlos on Diablo loco Sunday. It was a beautiful way to see the resorts from the Pacific, and see the beautiful land side. He showed us the famous arch, and told us great little stories about the area. We caught a striped marlin, and a mahi mahi, or durado. We got to have them prepared and cooked dockside at Captain Tony's, which was one the best ways to experience a trip like that. Best marlin sashimi ever, as well as the best tasting mahi mahi I have ever had. My husband is a commercial fisherman, so fresh fish means everything and this was spectacular. We spent more time in downtown Cabo this day and had a great time. We ate at the Bistro and had a few drinks before bed.

Monday we had room service for breakfast again, then did some more pool time. We preferred the skypool because we seemed to get fast and attentive service, as well as drinks that seemed to taste better. Alonso and John were great. We also spent time at the spa getting couples massage. So worth it because there are the different amenities like the pool and steam room while waiting or after your treatment. It was beautiful. We ate dinner at Manila Bar and had a very tasty pizza and yummy drinks. We spent some time in the lobby bar each night which was great, but I preferred El Bar in the market. During the last night, Ricardo took care of us at El Bar creating fun and different drinks just for us to try. That was a fun night! We liked the market because it was close to our building and you could order from several restaurants at one time, and they were all good.

Over all we loved this trip so much. Nancy Hernandez took care of us and our room everyday. She was absolutely thorough, kind, and made fun little towel animals. The cart drivers were attentive and friendly, and anyone we asked for support from made themselves available. It was an amazing trip, from beginning to getting the 10 minute lobby massage before leaving. I will remember this surprise trip from my husband forever. Thank you Pueblo Bonito Sunset Beach for taking care of us, you made our honeymoon very special.",Date of stay: January 2018,Pueblo Bonito Sunset Beach Golf and Spa Resort,4,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico"
Golfing with phenomenal views,"My husband and I stayed at Pueblo Bonito Sunset Beach for our honeymoon, and being that my husband is an avid golfer, this was a must. I rode along while he golfed and it was such an amazing day. My husband loved the layout of the course, as well as the challenges that it gave him. He golfed from the blacks just to say he did, and it was a lot of fun. The comfort stations were great along the way, and made the experience that much more enjoyable. We will definitely be back to challenge this wonderful course again, as well as for the views.",Date of experience: January 2018,Quivira Golf Club,4,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico"
A bad beginning but a better finish,"I had written a previous review while I was staying at the Resort the day I had a horrible experience with the room, and feeling as though I was not being listened to. We stayed a week in April, Sunday through Saturday. My luggage, while in room or in transit to my room, had become soiled with water or some form of liquid that smelled like sewage. It was on the bottom of my luggage, so I didn't notice it until the 2nd full day at the resort while I was organizing our room. The staff was not eager to help right away when I complained about the incident,and insisted that I had packed ice or water and that was the culprit but after an hour of back and forth they finally agreed to clean my clothes for free. They were returned clean, and fixed as a few looked as though they would be stained. They also fixed our shower after letting them know for a couple days that it flooded the bathroom, by putting about 2 in of caulking. It helped, the design of the shower was part of the problem. The resort attempted to be responsive after I wrote the first review, wanting to talk with me but I just wanted to try and enjoy my vacation.

It did get better, and since were there for our friend's wedding and with several other friends it helped. If you go on the slides, be careful. I am also sad the lazy river is so far from everything, including a full bar, and you are technically supposed to be a preferred guest. They are very fast and we witnessed several injuries being that our room overlooked the slides directly. My fiance received one of the injuries. The pools were beautiful and it was nice just to kick it my the swim up bar, which we did the majority of the time. The wait staff by the pool, as well as the workout instructors were very friendly, and made the experience very nice. Hector, Julio, Carlos, Benito and Elias were great among a few more.

We ate at the Brazilian Steak house, the buffet, the hibachi grill and the Tides most of the time we were there. Our friends enjoyed the steak house, but I couldn't eat much of the meat due to all the butter. The hibachi was fun and the food was very fresh. The buffet and the Tides were nice snack places. We went to Secrets for dinner a couple nights, which was nice to experience the other resort and the different style and their food was wonderful at the Italian restaurant. Food overall was good at Dreams.

We had the most fun at Spin bar because we often brought the fun. It was very difficult to find, but because we were mainly the only ones at the bar the first couple of nights there, they treated us very well and got to know us. That was nice because we would see them throughout the resort and they were quick to greet us. Jose was so kind and fun, as well as the other bartenders. We had a lot of fun. Mind you they play the same soundtrack every night, and every where so get used to hearing ""Cake by the ocean"" over and over. Good memories though.

The entertainment was lacking but you could see they were trying. It was a family resort and so they definitely catered to that. The bands and singers were really talented and did a great job.

We were not preferred but because our friends were we often got to tag along to the preferred club, and do ""preferred things"". They were treated with more amenities, and had a different welcoming than we did being non-preferred I guess, but if your ok with just a room to sleep in, which is the same as the preferred room, then save the extra money. It seems there were a few more perks.

Ultimately they should've completed the resort and made sure everything was working and up to resort quality before opening. It has potential to be a beautiful and great resort. I wish I had a better experience, but again it did get better before I left. A manager caught me before we departed, giving his sincerest apologies and sharing that he would love for us to stay again and we would be pampered. I will wait until they are completed with their construction, and see if they have improved. So much more to share but you will make up your own mind. Beautiful resort that has potential.",Date of stay: April 2017,Dreams Playa Mujeres Golf & Spa Resort,4,"Playa Mujeres, Mexico"
Memorable trip at an alright resort,"Positives: We chose to stay here for my boyfriends birthday, which turned into an engagement trip! With that said we stayed for 6 nights. When we arrived we were treated very well, and they gave us an itinerary of the weeks events and restaurant schedule. The rooms were nice, and the mini fridge was stocked with assorted beverages. We had ocean view so it was wonderful watching Boats come and go, as well as the sunsets.

The service at the Asian restaurant was great and the food there was very good. The Italian restaurant was pretty tasty as well but if you're hungry order extra. The Mexican restaurant was also good. The Cevicheria was yummy. Throughout the week we found we preferred the buffet over all.

The servers, especially Raphael, were pretty on top of making sure our hands were not empty when it came to lounging at the pool or the beach. There were a few servers that would seem to forget we were there. The pool was pretty nice, and the atmosphere was welcoming. The beach was small and the swimming area a little rough but we enjoyed it regardless. The vendors on the beach could be buggy but it wasn't too bad if you just said no, and if they persisted the security was good about handling the situation.

I felt safe and taken care.

Negatives: The room service was not very good. One night it wasn't available for a while due to ""something wrong"", and we were also hung up on at one point. One evening we waited 2 and a half hours for our food and it was luke warm upon arrival. I wouldn't recommend the hot dog or hamburger. Give ample warning when getting room service.

The alcohol seemed watered down, and would get really sweet after a couple drinks. Although the mojitos were yummy. We decided either to just drink beer, or order an extra shot to add to the drink.

When ordering from the restaurants, knowing that some of the food items and alcohol on the menus is extra outside of the all inclusive rate is important, as they will charge you.

I will say due to being on a couples trip, the kids playing, and babies crying got to be a little much at times so we will be intentional about staying at an adult only if we would like a different experience. It was nice to see they had some family friendly things though.

Stay hydrated! Take the time to explore outside the resort.

Overall it was a good time. It's Mexico and so we expected the heat, so didn't complain. It will forever be in our memories as the place we were engaged.",Date of stay: July 2016,Fiesta Americana Puerto Vallarta All Inclusive & Spa,4,"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico"
Nice for a short weekend,"Rooms were nice, and clean. Coffee in room was not complimentary- 10$. Make sure you pay the resort fee if you want to drink the bottled water in the room. Small pool area but impressed by the design! Would stay again. Only downside was the housekeepers threw away our souvenirs and when we complained the front desk basically just said sorry.",Date of stay: May 2016,Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino,4,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
Comforting,"Such a great getaway from the mainstream. We both love the outdoors and the lodge was a great way to be in nature but still be comfortable. Travel to the lodge was beautiful. We loved the warm and home like feel, and the staff was very welcoming. We plan to make the lodge an annual trip.",Date of stay: April 2015,Manitou Lodge,4,"Forks, Washington"
