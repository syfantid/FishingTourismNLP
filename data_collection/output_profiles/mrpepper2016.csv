best holiday ever,"The Aligis studios are the best we have stayed in on many trips to Greece. These studios are perfect, even a bath! Chris and Christhia (sorry not sure if that is the correct spelling) are the most welcoming hosts. This was our best holiday ever and hope to be back next year",Date of stay: July 2018,Aligis Studios,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
The best time ever!,"From the start Efi and Dimitri made us feel like we had always been onboard. We swam in crystal clear waters, helped to bring in the fish ( Snapper, Bream, Mullett, Scorpion and Parrot Fish ) which we later ate, with the most delicious salad and wine. Barracuda was my favourite, which I may have kissed! (optional) from the start to the finish we had lots of fun and learnt alot. Thanks to all our crew members and Efi and Dimitri Will see you again.",Date of experience: July 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
