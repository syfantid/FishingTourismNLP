Couldn't fault! One minor but ..,"My wife and I ate here after reading the good reviews. The food was excellent, the portions were large and the staff were very friendly.
The only but is we sat in the large garden which beautiful and both of us got well bitten! Next time I would choose to sit inside.",Date of visit: June 2019,Jerry's Elliniko,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Bit more expensive,Lovely restaurant with great food and service. I gave 4 out of 5 because it is more expensive than restaurants along the same road but I wouldn't day it was any better as all the restaurants I've been to in Katelios are excellent and are very similar.,Date of visit: June 2019,Cozy,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best boat trip !,"Great time had with Efi and crew, so much more than a normal holiday boat trip. We actually ate what we caught! Swimming and secluded beach visits were an added bonus.",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Value for money,"Stayed on February 24th for 1 night before an early morning flight.
For the price we paid Â£31 cannot really argue with the stay. Room was clean, bed was comfy, shower was hot and powerful!
A shame the bar / restaurant decor was very basic, cheap hard seats no carpet and loud unnecessary dance music!",Date of stay: February 2017,Travelodge Heathrow Central,4,"Hounslow, United Kingdom"
