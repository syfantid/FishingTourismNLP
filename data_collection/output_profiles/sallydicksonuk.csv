Friendly and relaxing hotel,"2nd visit to this hotel. Staff are friendly and helpful. Room was lovely, newly refurbished. Pool area very peaceful, loads of sun loungers and parasols. Breakfast is fairly simple but delicious.
Perfect distance from Katelios as not too far up the hill. Will definitely book again.",Date of stay: July 2019,Alkioni Hotel,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Amazing day!,"Highly recommend this trip! A warm and friendly welcome from Efi, Dimitrios and Muhammed. Coffee and sweet treats to start whilst meeting other passengers, then off to sea. Swim stops, seals, a clay pool, rod fishing, and bringing in the nets all part of a perfect day! Lunch was amazing- Efi cooked the fish we caught and provided salads and homemade wine - delicious!
Will definitely book again .",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely Pedicure with Shellac,I was treated by new lady Molly on Saturday. She made my rather neglected feet look absolutely gorgeous and was lovely to chat to. Thanks Sunrise.,Date of experience: September 2017,Sunrise Health and Beauty,4,"Marlow, United Kingdom"

Spot on sports massage,"I have been a client here for a number of years for good reason. The staff are always welcoming and the salon is really lovely. I booked a sports massage as was feeling tight around the neck and shoulders. It was just what I needed. A firm (but not painful)! massage, and the lady treating me checked a few times to see if I felt the pressure was ok. Ah, then the relax on a heated bed before coming back into the real world. Always a pleasurable experience. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend Sunrise ;-)",Date of experience: June 2017,Sunrise Health and Beauty,4,"Marlow, United Kingdom"
