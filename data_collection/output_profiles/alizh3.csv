Authentic fishing,"We spent two weeks on the island of Zakynthos and this program was by far the best of all those we took part in, We got to know a little bit of the real Zakynthos though our captain and his crew. Away from the crowd we could spend a day with friendly company and learnt a lot about fishing. Without this trip our holiday would have been less fun, and I also have to mention that for such a price it was well worth it.
