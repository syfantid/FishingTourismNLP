casual place with interesting cuisine,"we stopped at the Unchained Kitchen as part of a food tour in Halifax.
The restaurant is pretty inside , lots of wood and open space. Everything that we tasted was excellent....along with the craft beer that they produce.
We did not have a proper meal, but we tasted enough to know that this was a place to return to.
One of the owners spent time discussing their beer and was very informative.
If in Halifax i would make it a stop for sure.",Date of visit: September 2019,Unchained Kitchen,4,"Halifax, Canada"
lovely hotel with a spectacular view,"The hotel has a lot to offer and in fact is hard to want to even leave it .
The food is great, the only complaint would be the bread , all that I tried was not up to the the rest of the offerings. The fresh juice in the morning was such a delight.
All the amenities are top notch, the spa area, pool (immense!!) and warm.
The lobby and all the open spaces are comfortable and lovely..
My room was great and had a wonderful view of the falls. The bathroom was stocked with soft fluffy towels and a robe which I almost never took off going to the pool and spa every day.
Be aware of the monkeys, they will invade your space if you are not careful, especially with food on the patio. I found out the hard way and had to run into my room with my room service meal...
It is easy to get into the park from the hotel, you merely walk out of the door.
The grounds surrounding the hotel itself are also nice, there are hammocks to lie in and listen to the birds or read a book.
Speaking of birds, I saw fantastic toucans on the property just on my walk around.
The staff was helpful , really cannot say enough about this property..",Date of stay: March 2020,Gran Melia Iguazu,4,"Iguazu National Park, Argentina"
elegant small hotel,"Staying at the Hub Porteno felt as though you were in someones elegant home.
It was quiet, lovely and very genteel.
My room was large and comfortable with all the amenities that were needed, large closet, robe, great bathroom , desk and a little table and chairs .
The restaurant at the hotel is lovely but was not in use when I was there it was available for room service which was great , the food quite good, especially the empanadas.
The staff was excellent, Ivana could not have been kinder and more helpful.
If you enjoy small intimate hotels without a lot of bells and whistles, this should be your choice when staying in Buenos Aires.",Date of stay: March 2020,Hub Porteno,4,"Buenos Aires, Argentina"
"boutique hotel , great location","The Mine Hotel is located in an excellent area of Palermo. Just steps outside you can find charming shops, and all sorts of restaurants in an easy walking area.
The hotel itself is small , as was my room..however it was comfortable, clean and had all the amenities .
The breakfast rooms was bright and comfortable breakfast was great...in addition to the cold buffet , you could order hot food as well.
The lobby is small but there is a lounge area with sofas and many books for browsing or simply sitting and relaxing.
There is also a small pool area..I dipped my toe in and it was too chilly for me, but it is a nice touch and makes the hotel even more unique.
The staff was exceptional from the front desk to the cleaning crew.
All in all a great place to stay in Buenos Aires.",Date of stay: March 2020,Mine Hotel Boutique,4,"Buenos Aires, Argentina"
"small,charming hotel","This hotel is centrally located in El Calafate, which is a very bustling town in a beautiful part of Argentina. You can easily walk into town and find restaurants ,and many sophisticated shops.
The hotel is quite small and the rooms are as well...they are very basic but clean and comfortable.
Breakfast was in a bright sunlit room and there was a nice selection of items offered.
The owner/staff were very kind and helpful, you could tell they took pride in their establishment.",Date of stay: March 2020,MadreTierra Patagonia,4,"El Calafate, Argentina"
swedish style hotel,"The Simple hotel is just that, Simple in a lovely and soothing way., .rooms are large and comfortable, linens fine...bathroom floor heated.
Your view is of the water. The great room is used for dining or just relaxing with tea or a drink. If you want dinner at the hotel, you need to reserve. We chose not to eat there as dinner started at 8 pm and we knew we would be hungry before that hour.
Breakfast was good, there were hot choices along with the buffet.
The hotel is a little way from the charming town of Puerto Natales, however , you can walk there along a path that hugs the water or if you do not have a car, a taxi will take you . Highly recommended.",Date of stay: March 2020,Simple Patagonia Hotel,4,"Puerto Natales, Chile"
great hotel in a lovely setting,"We had not planned on staying at the Hotel Eco but the situation in Santiago prior to leaving for our trip made staying in the city center not feasible, however this change of plans turned out to be a pleasant surprise . The hotel is about 1/2 hour drive from downtown, but the setting is lovely. It is a quiet area mostly surrounded by homes and mid sized apartments..and lots of trees.
You can easily walk to many restaurants in the are , which we did.
Breakfast is included and was varied and very good, there was a nice outdoor patio attached to the dining room lush with foliage ....Francisco , one of the managers did a great job.
The service at the hotel was top notch and I should mention Pato, Ludwig,and Helida at the front desk.
The hotel did a excellent job of keeping plastic out of the premises which I really appreciated, you could easily fill up your glass water bottle that was provided.
The only tips I would leave would be to have a box of tissues in the room and to provide a robe as there is a charming outdoor pool area with lounge chairs that just begs for a robe.",Date of stay: February 2020,Hotel Eco Boutique Bidasoa,4,"Santiago, Chile"
great eating and walking tour,"We spent a few hours with Nicolas our guide with Urban Adventures.
Along with stopping at a variety of wonderful food tastings (the tour was food based)
We learned a great deal about the culture and history of Santiago.
It was an easy walk, although the weather was warm it did not interfere with our enjoyment.",Date of experience: February 2020,Urban Adventures Santiago,4,"Santiago, Chile"
charming garden,"The Royal Historic Garden is a gem. It is not too large so it is easy to navigate.
If you get tired and want a snack , there is a charming little house where you can order tea and a sweet then eat either indoors or outside in a casual garden setting.
There is also another building in which to view artifacts and offers a list of all the birds one might see on your walk...
a wonderful gift shop is on site as well , I bought seeds there , but upon entry into the USA I had to give them up....
While wandering throughout the garden i happened on a wonderful Arcadian Home circa 1670...inside were two fellows recreating a simple meal of biscuits and maple syrup..it was such a treat ...be sure to find out upon entering the garden the times offered to view the Arcadian Home , i just got lucky as it was open and treats were being served.... all in all a great place to visit in Annapolis Royale which
is a very significant town to visit..beautiful and history filled.",Date of experience: August 2019,Annapolis Royal Historic Gardens,4,"Annapolis Royal, Canada"
well done tour,"Lunenburg is a very charming town...many beautiful old homes in a waterfront setting.

we took a great walking tour with Ashlee, she did an excellent job of bringing the town alive for us..it was full of great detail and we learned a lot about the area.",Date of experience: August 2019,Lunenburg Walking Tours,4,"Lunenburg, Canada"
stately hotel perfect location,"The Great George is a unique hotel. The main hotel is a stately building steeped in history , the lounge area is very comfortable and it is where breakfast (quite good) is served and you can also enjoy tea in the afternoon.
There are also a number of charming homes nearby that are also owned by the hotel and those are available to rent as well...I am not sure how the rooms are configured in them as i did not go inside any .I can say that from the exterior they looked well appointed.
We were booked into another building owned by the hotel, our room was quite large and would have been perfect for a family as it had 2 bedrooms and 2 baths along with a living room and kitchen.
I would not have chosen this particular room for us as it did not reflect the quaint charm of the city ,but we were comfortable non the less.
Be sure to take the walking tour they offer at the Great George, it is well done and gives a great overview of the neighborhood which was brought back from a derelict state to the charm that it has now. Oliver was our guide and he did a great job.",Date of stay: August 2019,The Great George,4,"Charlottetown, Canada"
casual good dining room and food,"We enjoyed a few meals here while visiting the area. It was hard to consider another establishment since the food was so satisfying and good.
The menu featured fresh fish , meat and wonderfully fresh vegetables .
I was addicted to the delicious sticky toffee pudding for dessert, there were other offerings that sounded great, but not for me..
,. It was always busy but this did not affect the service which was efficient and very friendly..
They have a small cafe on the first floor that is open for a light breakfast as well.
They also sell a number of their products and you would be easily tempted to purchase after tasting them .",Date of visit: August 2019,Java Jack's Restaurant & Gallery,4,"Rocky Harbour, Canada"
"nice restaurant to enjoy drinks, lunch or dinner","We enjoyed a lovely dinner at this restaurant. Both my husband and I generally like to share our meals and the kitchen staff was kind enough to split our order beautifully.
There was a nice selection on the menu with many options for all sorts of taste.
The waitstaff was kind and efficient, the atmosphere comfortable",Date of visit: August 2019,The Brickhouse Kitchen & Bar,4,"Charlottetown, Canada"
comfortable small inn,"The hotel is quite small, it overlooks Bonne Bay , it is situated on a hillside very close to the highway. (not too noisy)
The room was clean and well appointed. There was a comfortable sitting area in the lobby where you can enjoy breakfast and tea in the afternoon.
A great perk was the ability to be able to use the washer and dryer for no charge,
There was a pub and a dining room.. we enjoyed dinners there, the food was quite good for such a tiny establishment.
The staff was helpful and could not have been nicer.",Date of stay: August 2019,Bonne Bay Inn,4,"Woody Point, Canada"
"casual dining , fun setting","Mallard cottage is a cute place in a charming little area of St. John's.
We actually walked there from our hotel in town .
We enjoyed a good dinner . The service was quick , food fairly priced and as i mentioned quite good. I seem to remember that the bread was also excellent.
All in all worth going to if you are in St. Johns.
Reservations needed.",Date of visit: August 2019,Mallard Cottage,4,"St. John's, Canada"
"lovely interior, expensive","We had dinner at Raymond's during our stay in St. Johns. The restaurant is lovely inside and the attention to detail is there with the service and table settings.
It may have been our choices but we found the food not up to the price we paid.
Since we only visited that one time, i would hold off on a definitive judgement of the place..
However, we were mostly disappointed with our particular meal that evening.",Date of visit: August 2019,Raymonds Restaurant,4,"St. John's, Canada"
"lovely setting , nice hotel","You will love the setting of this hotel, it is serene and beautiful. The hotel itself is plain .
The rooms are spacious and clean with a simple light wood decor , . Be aware that breakfast is from 7:30-9:30.. and there are no exceptions as i sadly found out.

This is not a sophisticated upscale hotel so we were happily surprised with the
onsite restaurant Black Spruce .. We ate 2 delicious dinners there that were
presented beautifully and tasted equally so.

Be sure to book in advance.",Date of stay: August 2019,Neddies Harbour Inn,4,"Norris Point, Canada"
surprised to find,"Our stop at the Insectarium was unplanned but quite wonderful.
There were literally thousands of live and mounted insects. One of the highlights was watching butterflies hatch from their cocoon.
You could walk through an area filled with butterflies of all types , then go to another room to view all types of insects and a beehive that was amazing .
All in all a great stop, they have a well stocked gift shop as well for all things insect.",Date of experience: August 2019,Newfoundland Insectarium,4,"Reidville, Canada"
a great day outdoors,"We enjoyed a great day out with Sea if Whales, we were given full flotation gear to put on for the chill and water so we were quite comfortable.
There were drinks and (homemade) snacks on board as well.
We flew through the water looking for whales and were not disappointed.
Highly recommend this tour.",Date of experience: August 2019,Sea of Whales Adventures,4,"Trinity, Canada"
Beautiful restaurant in a lovely setting,"We were staying nearby in Trinity and decided to eat dinner at the Fisher Loft.
It was exceptional! The setting was beautiful and the restaurant was equally as nice.
The food was wonderful, be prepared for a number of courses all delicious and served by a great waitstaff.
we had a little wait before dinner so we walked through the vegetable garden and browsed the general store on the property.
Reservations are a must in the busy season...you can also stay at Fishers Inn.
I did not see the rooms, but if they were anything like the restaurant i wouldn't hesitate.",Date of visit: August 2019,Fishers' Loft Inn Restaurant,4,"Port Rexton, Canada"
Inn by the water,"The Artisan Inn located in Trinity has many choices in which to stay.
There are private homes, rooms and suites all found within walking distance of one another.
Our room was comfortable, bathroom quite large, there was a refrigerator located in a small area outside our room that could be used by the guests staying on that floor.
The Inn is old, so do not expect the room to be modern , also the walls are quite thin we could hear our neighbors..
The nicest aspect was the outdoor deck overlooking the water...you could enjoy the view and a drink or tea.
We ate at the Twine Loft, the restaurant inside the Inn. This required a reservation in advance and a decision about your entree choice.
It was all very charming and enjoyable.",Date of stay: August 2019,Artisan Inn,4,"Trinity, Canada"

bed in brooklyn,"The Even hotel has a lot going for it , but it also is lacking in some areas.
The location is good, check in was easy and the hotel prides itself on its holistic atmosphere.
I just needed a place to stay near my daughter so I did not use the gym or the equipment in the room which would be a novelty for anyone who wants to partake.
The average price for a room is quite fair, although on the weekends it tends to get pricey ( more than i prefer to pay ) for this type of hotel. It has the feel of a hostel since the lounge and dining room are all in one area.and it was quite lively. I had dinner, a great salad and was served by a charming wait person names Learie J.
There is also a separate area where you can get fresh squeezed orange juice , coffee , tea and purchase some nice snacks, if you want to take away.
My biggest complaint had to do with the room....the bed was comfortable , shower area fine, but the window covering was so inadequate as to let it all the light from outside. I always bring a sleep mask with me , so i used it.
I would say, if you want a decent hotel and can get a room for under $150.00 a night the Even is a perfectly fine place to stay.",Date of stay: November 2019,Even Hotel Brooklyn,4,"Brooklyn, New York"

Mark was the captain of the comfortable boat that took us around, he really knows his lobster lore , we learned so much about lobster fishing, the business side and the

"ocean view , casual","We enjoyed a nice lunch at Tippy's...it is a very casual place and sits on a lovely beach.
You can actually walk to it if you are on French Leave Beach.
The prices are above average and it seems to be more of a bar type scene at night where I am pretty sure there is live music.
(we did not go at night)
All in all a good place for a meal.",Date of visit: January 2019,Tippy's,4,Eleuthera
library with a view,"The building that houses the library is lovely and is a meeting place on Governors Harbour.
They have a bin of take and leave books which was perfect for me as I had just finished my paperback and managed to pick up another one.

organic farm with a heart,"We were staying in Eleuthera for a month so I had a chance to visit Eleuthera Island Farm many times.
I bought all our salad supplies, fresh bread and a number of pre- made items as well. They are committed to improving farming on Eleuthera and trying to be sustainable.
I applaud them for their effort and I was very happy to be able to get fresh , organic food for our table.",Date of experience: January 2019,Eleuthera Island Farm,4,Eleuthera
"So lovely, yet so sad.......","French Leave Beach is beautiful, the water is clear and blue, the sand pinky white...
You can walk for a long way on this beach and not see too many people... ;what you do see , however, is plastic
There is an incredible amount of plastic that litters the sand...from broken beach chairs to plastic bottles and everything in between, I know this for a fact because each time i walked the beach i returned to my trash bin with a gigantic bag filled with it.
The debris washes on shore and collects in the seaweed, generally you do not see it floating in the ocean , but it cannot be avoided on the beach..
If you can ignore it, the beach is great.",Date of experience: January 2019,French Leave Beach,4,Eleuthera
sweets and breads,"This bakery is a little hard to find, it is located just off the main road in Governors Harbour in a residential area.
I tried a number of their sweets, but came away enjoying the fresh baked bread that I picked up hot from the oven.

"great food, prices , service","Pammy's may not look like much from the exterior, but inside the tiny space you can find delicious food at reasonable prices.
It is more of a take out as there are only about 4 tables, but if you go early for lunch you can find a seat. They do tend to run out of food towards the end of the day.
We were taken care of by Nikki, a lovely girl who always has a smile on her face.
We enjoyed a plate of ribs, and coleslaw and went back a few times.",Date of visit: January 2019,Pammy's,4,Eleuthera
do not expect too much,"We arrived at Soul Cal Smokehouse and
went to place our order from the girl staffing the counter who should have been interacting with the public. She was no help, barely spoke and told us that the ribs, along with half the menu, was not available and all we had to do was look up at the blackboard announcing this.
We settled for brisket dinner that included 2 sides.. the portions were little I chose not to eat.
He enjoyed the brisket and the sides although the beans were on the dry side.
The meal was served on a plastic orange tray, the food was squished into little to go cups and the portion of BBQ sauce was served in a tiny white cup, the kind that pills are dispensed from.
All in all the presentation was really poor and wasteful.
The irony of the situation was that I got up during his meal and noticed that the hanging board that announces what is sold out was missing the word RIBS , in other words , the ribs were not sold out anymore.
I asked the pitmaster and he confirmed that they would be ready any minute.
If when we arrived, were told this fact, we would have waited to order them, which was the reason we went to Soul Cal Smokehouse in the first place.
I find it very hard to give a glowing review, at least my husband enjoyed his dinner , but , judging from the sad welcome we received and the unappealing way the food was served , i personally will have a hard time returning .
My husband might go back for the ribs.",Date of visit: June 2019,Soul Cal Smokehouse,4,"Santa Barbara, California"
"lovely view, nice staff, hotel needs work","My daughter and i stayed at the Esperas for 3 nights in Santorini. The location was lovely especially watching the sunset. Our room was quite large, it contained a kitchen, two bedrooms , 2 bathrooms and a living room.
When i booked the hotel , i did not expect this configuration...and was surprised..
The outdoor patio that extended from the room was nice and you could lay out on the chairs ., it also contained a hot tub , which was fairly old and had a mildew smell about it.
The room itself was old, by that i mean not really updated...the bathroom had a lot of mildew on the floor, walls and in the shower area..the kitchen was in about the same condition and the living room had no comfortable furniture..
The towels were plentiful but almost threadbare..
On the plus side, breakfast was included and was very nice, you could order it to be delivered to your room or eat at the restaurant , which had a lovely view as well.
The service was exceptional and George went out of his way to make our stay nice.
Everyone at the hotel was helpful and professional...
There was a pool and a nice area to lounge and order drinks and nibbles.
This hotel is expensive, you are paying for a view, but i do think that it really needed updating especially in the rooms we were staying .
Be aware that there are many, many , steps involved at this hotel, both up and down .
which makes it interesting but a challenge for those not able to negotiate them.",Date of stay: September 2018,Esperas Santorini,4,"Santorini, Greece"
delicious,"I booked this restaurant prior to leaving the US and was glad that i did..since it was so good , my daughter and i ate there twice while in Rome.

We found Milos Fishing Experience and were so delighted we did. We met the small fishing boat in Pollonia , the boat was captained by Lizardos Nikolaos and his lovely wife.
We were just 5 passengers which was perfect because the boat was small..
Our day was incredible, not only did we fish, swim in amazing coves, but were fed the most wonderful food...the fish we caught, greek salad, bread, wine, dessert it was a delightful day.
I cannot say enough great things about this husband and wife team...they were charming , generous and sweet..I would not miss a chance to enjoy a day with them.",Date of experience: September 2018,Milos Fishing Experience,4,"Milos, Greece"
travel the easy way,"It was a delight to travel with Apulia Slow Travel...Pietro made the planning process quite easy and seamless.
He was helpful and had good suggestions. I had a lot of questions and input and he listened to what i wanted . We had quite a lot of emailing back and forth .. I was traveling with my daughter and needed transportation and hotel reservations in Puglia. and Pietro took care of it all. We did have a few different drivers during our trip and most were courteous and careful and always on time. One suggestion I would make is for the vans to always have water for the travelers and if possible have the same driver ...

.., Pietro is a great guide and is passionate about Puglia, we had a tour of an olive oil farm, and a cheese factory.
My daughter and I did not want to cram a lot of sightseeing into our trip but did want to get a feel for the area.
Our city choices were perfect and all the hotels were first rate , comfortable and clean.

comfortable and charming,"my daughter and i stayed at the Masseria for 3 nights..we enjoyed our stay there.
Our room was not in the Masseria (much to my surprise) but one of two small apartment style rooms with a kitchen (not needed) and a bedroom with 2 twin beds (as requested)

The room was clean, the bathroom shower was tiny....I would say that a normal sized man would have a hard time fitting into it...also, the curtains in the bedroom were
not adequate to keep out the sunlight early in the morning..

I found the room a bit depressing, I think a little more attention to it would go a long way..
Considering that i did see a traditional Masseria room that was available to me later in the stay ..there was quite a marked difference.

I have to add that i mentioned my disappointment to the manager , Daniel, who was very charming and helpful . He offered me a room in the Masseria for 2 nights as one had became available due to a guest checking out early.
.
I looked at it , it was quite lovely, at that point i did not feel it was worth moving out of our room and paying the difference in the price (Daniel did discount it for us)
The bed configuration in it would not have served my daughter and i as comfortably
as i would have liked...however it was very kind of him to offer it along with a discount.

In any case, be sure to ask for the Masseria rooms when booking.

The breakfast and dining rooms were lovely, there was a nice outdoor seating area as well for breakfast, lunch and dinner, or just to relax with a book.

There were many choices for breakfast including fresh baked cakes and pastries.

There was also tea and snacks available all day, I really appreciate this and think that
all hotels should provide this service..

The pool was large , there was a hot tub as well so we enjoyed using both of those.
while lounging around and reading.

The Masseria grows quite a bit of the vegetables that they serve , it was fun to walk back to the garden and see the tomatoes etc...also there was an area that housed bunnies and birds.

We had dinner at the Masseria one evening and it was wonderful! We enjoyed it so much while sitting outside with the candlelight and lovely table settings, considering the amount and quality of the food, the price was quite reasonable.
Be sure to book a table for dinner as there is limited space each evening.

All in all I think the Masseria is a great place to stay, it is quite close to many of the
larger towns for exploring...plus it is very different from the normal hotel stay.",Date of stay: August 2018,Masseria Salinola,4,"Ostuni, Italy"
unusual and elegant,"Matera is a very interesting city , staying in one of the hotels run by the Sextantio Group is a must.
The hotel group has a mission: to save the territorial identity of small villages in Italy including the landscape, history, architecture ,always using local materials and tradition.
The hotel was amazing! Situated in a cave it was elegant, and beautiful.
Everything was thought out to maximize the raw features of the cave , while making it as comfortable as possible..
Alex, at the front desk was so helpful and Anna, who worked service in the breakfast room (situated in a 13th century church ) was a delight.

The hotel serves a wonderful breakfast ..featuring homemade jams, breads, delicious cakes , eggs, fruit, and any type of coffee you wish.
The tables are set with fine linen, lovely flatware and dishes which only enhances the experience.

The hotel is set in a perfectly lovely area, with great views . Walking around town is a bit of a challenge since everything is either up hill or down hill....I suggest good walking shoes to be able to enjoy it fully.

The hotel offers dinner as well, we did not take advantage of it, deciding to explore the dining in town.

All in all an unforgettable experience.
