3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthi2019,August 2020,5,A fantastic cruise in Polyaigos! Perfect hosts!,"We were in Kimolos just for two days and we  were wondering if it's worth to go to Polyaigos. Thankfully we went and we enjoyed not only the pure turquoise water of Polyaigos sea but also a real fishing experience, guided by Mr Nikos and Mrs Froso, who do this job for years and know everything about fishing! They are two perfect hosts who made us feel like our home from the first moment. We had the chance to see the whole process of picking the net together with all the fresh fish were being caught, clean them and, undoubtedly the best part, eat them!! After enough stops at the best spots around Polyaigos, where we could swim, dive and relax, we ate the ""kakavia"" meal, made by Mrs Froso. A soup with all these fish inside. It is rare to find it and it was so delicious! They served it to us with ""skordalia"" (kind of garlic sauce), salads and fresh bread. I also liked that they were just 10 people in the fishing boat and we were like company. As Mr Nikos told us they take 12 people max. The price is 80 euros per person, but it's not expensive if you think that snack, beverages, main meal, fruit and sweet are included and the duration is about 8 hours. Don't lose this trip if you are in Milos or Kimolos. Highly recommend it!…"

We did 3 cruises in total during our trip, but THIS one exceeded every other cruise. From the people on board, to the amazing locations of Polyaigos we visited and the best food we ate on board, all these made a wonderful experience that we will treasure! We did 5 stops for swimming in crystal green and blue waters and Froso kept on feeding us wonderful recipes of her own. Our lunch was FRESH fish that Captain Nikos caught in the morning and they made a traditional “Kakavia” (the fishermen’s fish soup). Thank you so much for this gift on an experience and we wish you to continue being as you are!…"
