Sunset Cruise,"Anthony and his father are the most friendly people ever. We did two fantastic trips with them. We visited the volcano and did a sunset cruise. We were swimming in a beautiful bay and had an amazing dinner from fish, which they caught fresh before. We also saw the sunset accompanied by the great music performed by father and son.
We had a really unforgettable experience.",Date of experience: August 2020,Flora Fishing Tours,5,"Santorini, Greece"
