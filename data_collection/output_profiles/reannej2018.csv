"Lovely site, very clean","Lovely site, very clean and friendly, helpful staff. Returned here after visiting the first time in June 2019 we liked it that much. Great food and entertainment in the onsite bar called the Beachcomber. Also a very nice area, great for families, plenty to keep the kids entertained!",Date of stay: August 2019,Warren Farm Holiday Centre,4,"Brean, United Kingdom"
Sacrificed a day of our holiday!,"This trip was a fantastic day out, we had a lovely few hours sea fishing and then a meal cooked for us on the BBQ. Which was also very nice, I'm not a big fish fan so I had chicken which was seasoned lovely. My partner had the fresh fish caught that day, which I tried and really wish I'd had the fish instead! However, the hygiene on the boat was extremely poor. There wasn't any soap or hand sanitizer to use after handling the raw bait which had been given to us in plastic cups. There were some pieces of bait already in the cups so you can imagine how long that was sat there in the baking sun! Anyway, a few hours after arriving back at the hotel, my partner began to feel ill. And not long after he started with diarrhoea and sickness, which lasted throughout the night and the next day. Therefore we missed out on a day of our holiday! My advice would be, take some hand sanitizer on board with you and don't put your hands anywhere near your mouth afterwards. Common sense, but just as a warning to others!",Date of experience: October 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Amazing find!,"What an amazing find, well worth the 10 minute walk from our hotel in Rhodes old town. The service was fantastic, and the steaks were even better. The waiter came and showed us a board of all the fresh cuts they had to offer. I had the Angus sirloin and my partner the tomahawk.They were cooked to perfection and the best steak we'd ever eaten. Well worth a visit. Lovely evening",Date of visit: October 2018,El Toro Steak House,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
