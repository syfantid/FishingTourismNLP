Superb Day!,"What an amazing day! My Wife and I chose to be falconers for the day in Doddington Place Gardens. It was truly brilliant and we had great exposure to the birds. During the day we flew a barn owl, a Bengal Eagle Owl, a Vulture, a Chilean Blue Eagle, a Harris Hawk and a Mottle Owl. There was also a chance to see all the other birds. Our falconer was Laura who was superb and taught us so much through the day. I canâ€™t speak highly enough of the people and the venue and the whole experience. Highly recommended!",Date of experience: April 2018,The Hawking Centre,1,"Doddington, United Kingdom"
Outstanding Pizza,"Wow, proved for 24 h sourdough Woodford pizza. If you like amazing pizza head down to Acquolina. It might just be the best pizza I've ever had....",Date of visit: March 2018,Acquolina In Bocca,1,"Egham, United Kingdom"
First 5* Dining experience,"We went to The Tudor Room as a one of experiece and were very pleased.. 7 stunning courses delivered in a fun and engaging manner.... A couple of tips from me... Think carefully how much you value the ""flight of wines"" paired for each course... This is something which will add to the overall experience and allow the Somelier to teach you a little about the wines. On the other hand you can order whole bottles which can save save a bit of money... and probably get you a bit more quantity of wine!!!! Another tip was when it came to desserts, both the chocolate thingy and the cheese board were great, if possible order one each and share so you don't miss out...!!

By the way - i once went to a Michelin star restaurant and left hungary... it won't happen here... absolutely full and content --- top marks!",Date of visit: April 2017,Tony Parkin at The Tudor Room,1,"Egham, United Kingdom"
Great,Before I went hear I read quite a few reviews commenting on the decor so let me just say that it's really nice and they've done a great job on the refurbishment. The food was very good and the service was friendly if a little haphazard at times. I'd definitely recommend overall.,Date of visit: December 2016,The Rose & Crown,1,"Egham, United Kingdom"
Impressed...,"Like many people i've been to a lot of indian restaurants over the years.... But i really felt the quality here was a bit higher. I'd highly recommend the lamb tikka and onion bhagis, while the quality was high the price is fair.. Great job",Date of visit: November 2016,Megna Tandoori Indian Restaurant,1,"Englefield Green, United Kingdom"
Amazing trip....,"We booked the sunset fishing trip with Anthi. We met up about 3.30pm in Vilhada. We set out and the crew pulled up 17 'lobster pots' where we found about 2-3KG of shrimps and a fearless octopus, the crew then pulled up 600m of nets and found about 5 kg of fish. We cruised on to a pleasant cove where we went snorkelling. After that we cast out a few lines for some token fishing. Meanwhile, Anthi and the other crew members barbaqued the fish and prepared a delicious meal. Finally we cruised out of the cove a saw a stunning sunset before heading back. This whole experience was absolutely brilliant and I would highly recommend this trip and wish Anthi and the crew success in the future.",Date of experience: September 2016,Giorgaros fishing tours Santorini,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Sweet Honeymoon...!,"We just got back from a 2 week stay at Santorini Heights. It's a great place - clean, modern with friendly staff. We were in the Garden Suite which, like the others was lovely. It's superbly located further up the road from Pyrgos which means you are away from the main tourist hubs. I'd highly recommend.",Date of stay: September 2016,Santorini Heights,1,"Santorini, Greece"
it's a fancy joint...,"Selene is a fancy joint knocking out fancy food and wine at fancy prices. The food tasted great but I got irked by not getting full up for EUR180, it is possible to get full up if you spend EUR250 on a meal for 2 and it will taste good.",Date of visit: September 2016,Selene,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Don't miss it...,"By sharing your experiences, you're helping travellers make better choices and Mexaxy Mas is an awesome restaurant perched on the side of a hill. You'll be sure to get free Raki and dessert which is a huge plus in my book. The food is excellent, especially the meats and the potato chips are the best I've ever had! The service can be a bit hap hazard but who cares - the food, price, view and free stuff make it a serious win. Advance booking essential.",Date of visit: September 2016,Metaxy Mas,1,"Santorini, Greece"
perfect....,"Feggera is a restaurant which is taking things up a notch or two. It's Greek cuisine taken to a new level which demonstrates the technical skills of the chef. I genuinely felt it's one of the best restaurants I've been to. When you consider the food quality, the presentation, the setting and service I believe it's an absolute bargain. There's no carafe wine sold here which forces you to buy a glass / bottle of one of the excellent Gavalas wines available which is probably a good thing! Hot tip, try the fava beans... Top marks",Date of visit: September 2016,Feggera,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Very Very Very Good,"This is a very good restaurant up in Pyrgos, the setting is quite stunning and the food was pretty decent also. I'd certainly go back.",Date of visit: September 2016,Cava Alta,1,"Santorini, Greece"
so so visit with great views,I went here around 6.30 and joined a tour which was followed by a wine tasting. The tour which we were told was going to cost EUR3 was rubbish. The tasting was ok if a bit impersonal. At the end they didn't charge us for the tour which was a relief... Overall it was Ok experience.,Date of experience: September 2016,Venetsanos Winery,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Nice little tour and tasting,"This was a great visit. Rocked up a a lovely lady showed us around whilst sharing some information and answering questions. Then we did a tasting which is a simple little format of EUR1-2 per glass. Then we bought some wine, then we left. I was happy.",Date of experience: September 2016,Gavalas Winery,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Audio tour!!!!!!!!!!,A terrific stroll underground getting some wine history through a audio device. You can't beat a good audio tour in my opinion - and getting some wine history through a pre-recorded tape is splendid if you think about it hard enough. Then you get to taste some wines. All super.,Date of experience: September 2016,Wine Museum Koutsogiannopoulos,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Pork Gyros,"I arrived at about 6pm and the sun was high up in the sky, then suddenly it started to sink slowly down towards the sea. Finally it turned pink before it disappeared. Then I heard a voice which said, 'You are the chosen one'. I left quickly to get some pork gyros.",Date of experience: September 2016,Sunset in Oia,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Chill out....,"This place is really orange, a bit like Easyjet, but luckily there is more leg room. In fact there is an array of seating opportunities, such as bar stools, chairs, palettes, sacks of rice and so on.. more than you need really. They offer good grub and expensive shakes. I only went there for lunch but had a sneaky feeling it might be a good place to get wasted.",Date of visit: September 2016,Tranquilo,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Could improve....,"This is a big barn covering some old stuff. It worth a visit but it could be improved if they offered an audio tour. Otherwise you need to read all the little signs and run the risk of getting elbowed out if the way. Also, it seemed to miss some of the most interesting points, like a section speculating on what happened to all the people who used the live there? Or a building showcasing some of the artefacts that had been unearthed? Or a mention that the roof collapsed a few years ago killing a tourist.. It's all history.",Date of experience: September 2016,Akrotiri Archaeological Site,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Hot Sand....,"This beach has sand and sea. In the sea you can see fish. On the beach there are sun beds and umbrellas. The men on this beach wear swimming trunks or swimming shorts. The women on this beach wear bikinis, swimming costumes or only their bikini bottoms. When it is sunny the sand gets really hot, so hot I had to run to get in the sea. Once I was in the sea I realised I couldn't get back to my sun bed without burning my feet so I stayed there until the sun went down.",Date of experience: September 2016,Perissa Black Sand Beach,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Top Value,"This is a decent Greek place that has a traditional feel. We popped in for lunch a couple times. The food is not going to be the best you have ever had, but it's really good and the price is superb which gets it top marks from me.",Date of visit: September 2016,To Koutouki Tou Bekri Taverna,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Good food...,"This place is a bit further down the road from Metaxy Mas. It probably lacks a bit of character, but from a food point of view it was really really good. The service was also good. When we went there it was very quiet but all the others in there appeared to be locals which is probably a good sign. I guess it just lacked that bit of magic which makes some of the other restaurants so popular.",Date of visit: September 2016,Anemoloos,1,"Santorini, Greece"
"Bad food, good view","Stopped in for a quick lunch and ordered fava beans, Greek salad and a bottle of water. The fava beans and Greek salad were the worst I found in Santorini but the water was completely fine and the view was nice",Date of visit: September 2016,Atlantida,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Better than average...,"A busy restaurant in a forecourt away from the main part of Imerovigli, it's popular and a queue formed outside whilst we were there. They knock out good food, but it's not exactly memorable.. A guess it was more functional than memorable!",Date of visit: September 2016,Anogi,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Almost.....,"This is a great restaurant with nice service and a tidy limited menu. I went for the 4 course set. Both the starters were nice.. The salmon was quite subtle but good and the mushroom course was very tastey. The steak for main was well cooked - nice and rare.. Whilst I thought the service was generally pleasing, they seemed a bit rushed off their feet. My other criticism was that the main was over seasoned.. Hold back on the salt if you want 5 stars from me!",Date of visit: June 2016,The Olive Kitchen & Bar,1,"Copenhagen, Denmark"
So happy with my burrito!,"I don't visit Woking that often, but having found a place serving great Burrito's I might have to start coming more often. Big, tastey, quick and clean inside. There is not much else to say.....",Date of visit: May 2016,Araceli's,1,"Woking, United Kingdom"
Hit the nail on the head,I really like Tight.. Nice cozy restaurant full of young people. It's quite on trend with a straight forward menu. I went for the the rice rolls followed by steak. Excellent steak cooked perfectly (if you ask for rare you'll get proper rare steak). Following that a cheesecake type dessert which was terrific. Great selection of wines by the glass. Go for it!,Date of visit: April 2016,Restaurant Tight,1,"Copenhagen, Denmark"
Pretty good on the whole......,"Overall this is a good place. The two lagoons and surrounding area are a big win. One lagoon is not heated providing a quieter place to put in some decent swimming, the other is heated and provides a good place for bobbing around!

As for the food, despite not being a buffet fan I have to admit it was pretty good with a large variety and decent quality. As half board guests we had breakfast and dinner included as default, but the hotel is more than willing to allow you to switch the dinner for lunch, meaning we were able to have meals out in the evening without missing out on something you'd already paid for.

The rooms were nice, clean and sufficient and the staff friendly. The place is BIG and it's probably inevitable that it can lack the personal touch at times.

Unfortunately there wasn't any working wifi available. Another issue was that our bathroom smelt really bad... It was one of those annoying issues which we could easily have complained about and would most likely be moved room but since we were pleased with the room and didn't want the trouble of packing up our belongings we decided to put up with it. Another mildly annoying point was that they squeeze a bit of cash out of you at lunch and dinner time by charging for ALL drinks including water.

In conclusion I would recommend this hotel. We used it as a great base to explore the island.",Date of stay: April 2016,Barcelo Fuerteventura Thalasso Spa,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Almost there.....,"A very decent restaurant... First big positive was the house rioja which was served in some fabulous glasses. The starter - cured beef was good. We both had fillet steak for the main courses, not bad at all. My fiancÃ© went loopy (in a good way) over the mushroom and truffle sauce. The accompanying potatoes were served well. If I'm being critical I found a few faults, overall slightly too much salt in the seasoning and they should cook the steak at a slightly higher temperature to caramelise the outside a bit more, plus the dessert was average.

That said, volcano was the best restaurant we found in Caleta and I would go back.",Date of visit: April 2016,Volcano Restaurant,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Hit and miss.....,"Ate here for an evening meal and found that some parts were good and others bad. The house red wine wasn't good to start with. Then i made a mistake by ordering something called 'garlic bread with mozzarella, parma ham and asparagus' i had a different idea in my mind but what arrived was something you'd expect from pizza hut - a thick greesy pizza like thing that you certainly wouldn't want to eat before a main course. The mains were good and the dessert average. The place itself was drab and crampt but they are having a returb at the end of match 2016.",Date of visit: March 2016,La Piazzetta,1,"Virginia Water, United Kingdom"
Great Napolian pizza,Quite basic inside but really nice Napolian pizza. Personally i like the fact it's a bit different. Service was a bit hit and miss. Like they forgot to offer us black pepper and chili oil.,Date of visit: January 2016,Pizza Pilgrims,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Always great!,"I've been here quite a few times and it's always good... Top Food, good service and good value. There seems to be a focus on providing good Food and service rather than up selling which a lot of resturants go for..",Date of visit: February 2016,Caspari,1,"Englefield Green, United Kingdom"
Good!,"I've been here twice recently, once on a saturday lunchtime where i was surprised to find the place full. The menu, Food and Service where great! A second visit one evening didn't quite match the first experience but wasn't bad..",Date of visit: February 2016,Bar 163,1,"Egham, United Kingdom"
Lovely food,"Somehow feels like a Service station gone wild. Brilliant Food, lovely and Fresh but slightly unusual setting!",Date of visit: February 2016,Italian Concept Restaurant,1,"Egham, United Kingdom"
Delivered!,"Just returned from an excellent week in Cape Verde and the hotel definitely contributed to the successful week. The rooms are clean, modern and cleaned thoroughly each day. The pool is big, deep, square, clean and cool - just how I like them! The beach area is also nice. The staff were always friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is great, 5mins walk into town where you can find restaurants and shops...

We went for B+B only and the only disappointment of our stay was the breakfast, it had a bit of a budget feel about it and there could have been more healthy options.

Despite the ropey breakfast I'm still giving top marks as everything else was spot on...",Date of stay: April 2015,Hotel OÃ¡sis Salinas Sea,1,"Ilha do Sal, Cape Verde"
Good Place.,Marea is worth a visit. Very nice people and delivering good Italian food in a quiet setting. The bread served with the meal is the best on the island. Worth finding it and it makes a nice change from the restaurants in town and along the beach...,Date of visit: April 2015,Marea Restaurant,1,"Ilha do Sal, Cape Verde"
Go-for-it!,"It's a small place in the centre of town. The starter - ""fish starter"" was the best we found during our holiday, it's a combo of fish tartar, smoked fish and fish carpaccio. Delicious! The main courses was also very good. All the mains seem to be served in the same way.. with mash, rice and salad, it gives a bit of a home cooking feel and is perhaps a bit unadventurous.. Find this restaurant and give it a try!",Date of visit: April 2015,Chez Pastis,1,"Ilha do Sal, Cape Verde"
Seems to offer something a bit different....,"I liked Le Prive! The setting is nice, surrounded by flowers in a courtyard.. The starter (Blinis) was terrible but the mains made up for it... What I liked were they are trying to be a bit different... I had an excellently cooked tuna steak with a slice of mango and an onion chutney, this was accompanied by hummus, artichoke, carrots and green beans.. not exactly a French classic but unique and tasty... I'd definitely go back..",Date of visit: April 2015,Le PrivÃ¨,1,"Ilha do Sal, Cape Verde"
Somehow mixed impressions,"Nice setting, but a grumpy waitress... It's one of these places which is trying to be unnecessarily flash, for instance it's one of the only restaurants in town which doesn't have a house wine and has all the veggies/salads and potatoes as sides which you need to pay extra for... as for the actual food, it's no better than anywhere else.. go for the view...",Date of visit: April 2015,Farolin,1,"Ilha do Sal, Cape Verde"
Surprisingly different mains!,"Interesting experience.. Had the fried prawns as a starter which were awful. As for the mains - one went for tuna with tropical fruit and the one went for tuna with yogurt... The tuna with tropical fruit was stunning. Beautifully cooked tuna fillet pink through the middle. The tuna with yogurt was different though, a different cut of tuna and cooked right through.. somehow disappointing..",Date of visit: April 2015,Restaurante Barracuda,1,"Ilha do Sal, Cape Verde"
Smoothly does it.,Terrific smoothies in a nice atmosphere.. Avoid the sandwiches and go for the homemade wraps! Worth a visit when you are in Santa Maria!,Date of visit: April 2015,CapeFruit,1,"Ilha do Sal, Cape Verde"
