"Great Food, Quite Setting, and Friendly Service",My wife and I stopped in here for our last meal before heading back the next morning. We wanted something Greek and traditional and it was amazing! The plate was large and with lots of good food. The waiter was attentive and very friendly. It was a great end to a fantastic trip!,Date of visit: July 2019,Το Κofini,1,"Santorini, Greece"
A Great Boat Ride,"Nikos and his wife Frossa were very welcoming and friendly hosts for the day. Frossa speaks great English, and made it very clear that the boat was to be like home! She said help yourself to whatever and you don’t need to ask me :) They immediately welcomed us with a coffee and explained what we were going to be doing for the day: pulling in Nikos’ net for the fish, and swimming at some of their favorite spots. They said whatever the group feels like doing, we can do!

The food was amazingly fresh as you eat the fish pulled up right in front of you a few hours later. The couple is very knowledgeable about fishing in the islands, and explained the different kinds of creatures that came out of the net. This included red snapper, barracuda, shrimp, squid, crab, lobster, and even 2 sting ray!

The only critique I would offer is that we didn’t have an opportunity to personally fish. They set the nets prior to the trip and they pull them up as our first stop. It’s a very cool experience to watch them pull in the catch but there wasn’t any hands on fishing as we expected from the description at the travel office. I think they would have let us fish with rod and reel had we asked, but they did say it wasn’t the right type of fishing for the time of year. No problem for us!!

The boat would stop often for swimming and they were very flexible with timing as it’s a small private boat and not a large tour company. The island they visit has the clearest water I’ve ever seen! Over all, I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to get out on the water and see a different perspective of the Greek Islands! You’ll also have a wonderful time chatting with the friendly Frossa and Nikos, learning about their island life.",Date of experience: June 2019,Milos Fishing Experience,1,"Milos, Greece"
This place is the highlight of our trip!,"We stayed in Sant’Agnello for four nights and every night we came here for dinner! We looked around at other places to eat but nothing offered the amazing hospitality, delicious food, and affordability like Il Routino! The owner and his wife great every guest as they come and go and instantly you feel like part of their Italian family.

And to top it off they have such a varied menu and amazing food after four dinners in a row, I would still go back again tomorrow to try something new!

Il Routino, thanks for making our stay in Sorrento even better!",Date of visit: June 2019,Il Ruttino,1,"Sant'Agnello, Italy"
Best Tour of Amalfi!,"We had a fantastic time with Micheline and Raffaele! Micheline was a fantastic guild and was full of information and passion for the Amalfi coast. I would take the tour all over again to spend another day listening to her share her passion!
This is one of the best tours I have ever taken and Micheline is the best guild I have ever had.
Micheline- thanks for such a fantastic day, we all have a great trip!",,"Amalfi Coast Day Trip from Sorrento: Positano, Amalfi, and Ravello",1,"Sorrento, Italy"
An Amazing Experience!,"My wife and her sister took Chef Vary’s pasta making class this afternoon and had the best time! She was welcoming and very funny! As she walked us through each step of the process, we learned about the different ingredients and where they came from. The meal was delicious. With four different kinds of pasta and two different kinds of wine, it was the highlight of our trip!",Date of experience: June 2019,Chef Vary,1,"Florence, Italy"
Canal View and a Beautiful Setting,"One of the most serene and peaceful places we’ve stayed. Each room with a private balcony, our’s overlooking the canal, makes for a great stay. It’s in the middle of a preserve so it takes a little while to get to but it is totally worth it and provides a great all around service.",Date of stay: April 2019,Hotel Cafe Restaurant Het Rietershuijs,1,"Kalenberg, The Netherlands"
Extremely Rude Service,"I have very little patience for being talked to rudely, especially when I am a customer. During a visit to the Campbell's Farmer's Market we stopped in for a cup of coffee at Orchard Valley. We love going to unique coffee shops, particularly for great coffee and a fun atmosphere. The line was moving fast and the wait for drinks was short. When the barista called out two lattes and we were next in line waiting for drinks I asked if they were the correct order because she called one of them as almond milk. She rolled her eyes at me and told me ""then maybe those aren't yours"". I steped back and continued to wait another few minutes while others order's were picked up. After a few minutes she checked with the cashier to make sure we ordered correctly, and then proceeded to remake our drinks.

I would rather have gone to Starbucks where I know my drink will be made right or remade without any attitude from the staff.",Date of visit: March 2019,Orchard Valley Coffee Roastery,1,"Campbell, California"
Best Breakfast Sandwich!,We were at the farmers market and stopped by their food truck to grab one. Best biscuit with chicken ever! Freshly made biscuits and really good chicken! Make a point of checking this place out!,Date of visit: November 2018,Pine State Biscuits,1,"Portland, Oregon"
Amazing and Reasonably Priced,This place is a must if you are going to be in the area. The lines are a little long but the wait is well worth it. Make sure to try something off of their specialty menu as well as get a pastry. The coffee is good and the sandwiches are filling. All in all a great stop for a good bite to eat at a great price!,Date of visit: June 2018,Porto's Bakery & Cafe,1,"Glendale, California"
Nice and Relaxing,"Whether you are looking for some high end shopping or just a relaxing day near a fountain, the Americana has it all! The staff is friendly and helpful and the grassy areas are open to the public. Grab a blanket and hang out in the shade while watching the musical fountains.

Parking is close by and easy to get to and if you need a validation the food options are almost endless.",Date of experience: June 2018,The Americana at Brand,1,"Glendale, California"
Overpriced and slower service.,"My wife and I found this on a list of top places to eat in Glendale. The building is very cool and worth looking at. It looks likes it’s all original from the 60s or 70s. The food however was not good. The burgers were frozen patties with hardly any flavor and the fries were stale and greasy.
Not sure how this place made a top places to eat list if not for the historic building.
I wish it was better because I really wanted to like it.",Date of visit: June 2018,Foxy's Restaurant,1,"Glendale, California"
Awesome find!!,This place is a great find and good for the area. It’s not in a typical spot but it’s worth the walk or drive to get here. The Australian coffee house offers strong drinks and a taste of some classic Aussie foods. Fun staff who are friendly and welcoming and a nice covered side area with a few tables. There’s no seating inside so grab a table outside and enjoy your brew while taking in the atmosphere.,Date of visit: June 2018,Little Ripper Coffee,1,"Los Angeles, California"
Fun to see but expensive.,"We just can back from a trip to Cambria. We stopped to check out the Hearst Castle because everyone talks about it. It was cool to see the grandeur and luxury the castle brought back in its time. However, $25 a person is a little steep for a tour a nice old ranch home. The guide was good and made it feel like you were back in the day experiencing how it was back in the Hearst time. It was rainy and I’m glad we stopped but if the weather is nice, I’d rather drive the beautiful cost. Very interesting history though!",Date of experience: April 2018,Hearst Castle,1,"San Simeon, California"
Great Experience!,"My wife and I stopped in to see what this was all about and were blown away by how cool it was to see. I could spent a lot of tome looking at the different seals and watching them fight for better positions on the pile of other seals. Take the time to stop, get out and walk the board walks!",Date of experience: April 2018,Friends of the Elephant Seal Visitor Center and Gift Shop,1,"San Simeon, California"
Best place in town for coffee,"We stayed two nights in Cambria and each morning we drove down to the Coffee Roasting company for some coffee. The staff was friendly and well trained. They have the classics as well as some fun drinks to give a try. If you’re a coffee drinker make sure you stop. It you are looking for a bakery, they don’t have a huge selection but a few scones and such.",Date of visit: April 2018,Cambria Coffee Roasting Co.,1,"Cambria, California"
Great Wines!!,We tried quite a few different places over the three days we were in the area and this was our favorite. The wines were amazing. The setting is nice. And the staff was friendly and really knew their stuff. We bought two bottles and I’m already disappointed that we didn’t get more. Make sure to try the Cabernet Sauvignon. Very good!,Date of experience: April 2018,Donati Family Vineyard,1,"Templeton, California"
"Good wines, higher prices",This place has some good wines but their prices are a little higher than others in the area. The Phoenix was the best one that we tasted here. They have a lot of GSMs but none that really stood out to us. Very cool tasting rooms with a decorative ceiling.,Date of experience: April 2018,Cypher Winery,1,"Paso Robles, California"
Great place to stay and a good value!,"We booked the King fireplace room and when we arrived they had upgraded us to the cabin room. It was nice and clean but the rooms smelt a bit smokey from the previous guest. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were decorated nicely with the country western theme. The staff was helpful with check in and providing recommendations for things to do in town and around the hotel grounds.

The best part of this hotel are the outdoor gas fire pits. There are several around the property and are great places to open a bottle of wine, sit back and enjoy the ocean air.",Date of stay: April 2018,Oceanpoint Ranch,1,"Cambria, California"
What an amazing experience!!,"My wife and I had a great trail ride this afternoon with Tara and her Clydesdales! She set us up on the horses after giving a good overview of how they different from riding other breeds. The trail ride lasted well over an hour and the whole thing was 2 hours from start to finished.

The trail winds up the ranch to a cleared hill top where you can see miles of the coast line and sweeping views of the surrounding hills. She offered to take some pictures of us on the horse before we headed back down the hill.

If you have ANY interest at all you gotta check it out! Totally worth the money!!",Date of experience: April 2018,Covell's California Clydesdale's Ranch,1,"Cambria, California"
Very Fun Atmosphere,We checked out this place while visiting family in AZ. Really cool atmosphere and a good selection on the menu. Some classics with good spins. It was featured on Diners Driveins and dives and it a pretty cool place on a warm night. Great outdoor seating,Date of visit: March 2018,Joe's Farm Grill,1,"Gilbert, Arizona"
A MUST for lunch or breakfast!,Super good burritos in a fast paced yet relaxed environment. Great breakfast burritos and horchata. This place was recommended to us and I was glad we stopped. Prices are reasonable and there is plenty of seating.,Date of visit: March 2018,Burrito Shack,1,"Mesa, Arizona"
Amazing Private Views,"I was happily surprised with the Ocean View Lodge! The rooms were large and spacious. Even though they were a little dated you could tell that they were well kept and state of the art back in the day.

The service was friendly and welcoming. This place is great for a quite get away right on the coast. You can walk along the cliffs from the hotel and it’s a two minute ride to places in the town too. Overall, this is a great find and I hope we can come back soon.",Date of stay: February 2018,Ocean View Lodge,1,"Fort Bragg, California"
Fun and worth the stop!,"The important thing to remember is which beach you should go to. Beaches 1 and 2 have the me most glass left and are fun to explore while beach 3 is the easiest to access.
Make sure you follow the rules and don’t take glass from areas you aren’t allowed.

It’s best to make a treasure hunt out of it trying to find the rarer colors and shapes.
It’s fun and worth a stop if you are in Fort Brag but unless you are a sea glass enthusiast it wouldn’t be worth a trip to the town.",Date of experience: February 2018,Glass Beach,1,"Fort Bragg, California"
Great Selection of Great Beers,This place was delicious. We stopped in for dinner one of the nights we were in town and loved it. They have a bunch of brews to choose from and I couldn’t find one that I didn’t like. The food was also good but s little on the expensive side. Worth a stop just to have a beer or two!,Date of visit: February 2018,"North Coast Brewing Co. Taproom, Restaurant & Bar",1,"Fort Bragg, California"
Great location but plan ahead!,"The lodge itself is pretty nice. It’s right up against the river and has private views from your room. Only a few miles from the park, you can save a little money by staying outside of the park.

The room had a fully stocked kitchenette which was a nice surprise. There was a microwave and a stovetop along with serving dishes and pots and pans.

The downside: the WiFi is not included and is quite pricey. If you have Verizon it’s not to big of a deal in the park but other carriers don’t work that well. We have Verizon and didn’t have any service at the hotel.

The restaurant was extremely overpriced and the quality was pretty disappointing. I highly recommend bringing food with you and cooking in your room or eating lunch and dinner in the park.",Date of stay: February 2018,Yosemite View Lodge,1,"El Portal, California"
A great place to stop and enjoy!,The dinning room at the majestic hotel is worth stopping in for lunch! We stopped for a bit to eat and relax and it was perfect. While you are there make sure you walk around the hotel and take time to sit in the great room and relax. The perfect stop to a day of trails and hiking.,Date of visit: February 2018,The Ahwahnee Dining Room,1,"Yosemite National Park, California"
The BEST Greek Food!,Don’t waste your time with places like Nick the Greek! Go straight to Souvlaki’s. The staff is friendly and local and the owner is often working serving tables. It’s a small space but the food is to die for. They make amazing zucchini fries and gyros. Give them a try!,Date of visit: February 2018,Souvlaki Greek Skewers,1,"San Jose, California"
The perfect cafe for Half Moon Bay,"It’s a great little place with big shareable tables and a super friendly staff. They have really good coffee and their pastries and soups looked delicious. We had a macaroon that was AMAZING. Photos from around the world hung on the walls. Really cool place. There are a lot of little cafes in this town but you should
make sure to check this one out!",Date of visit: December 2017,Cafe Society,1,"Half Moon Bay, California"
So Much Fun Charm!,This place is a little hard to find and off of the beaten path but it is totally worth the search! The fondue is fantastic and service is great. Great atmosphere with Swiss decorations hanging from the walls and rafters. Not a typical Carmel stop but totally recommend it.,Date of visit: December 2017,Lugano Swiss Bistro,1,"Carmel, California"
Rude and Slow,"The lady who took my order yelled at the cashier before her to switch but apparently she was better. Then she proceeded to mess up my order and over charge me till I had to spell it out for her.

No apology just threw me my change.

All said and done I spent 30 minutes waiting for my food and that was after I waited 10 minutes to order.

During my time waiting I had a chance to see the restaurant. Gross! If I hadn't already paid and waited I would have just left.

No wonder DQs are going out of business nationwide.",Date of visit: August 2017,Dairy Queen Grill & Chill,1,"Blue Earth, Minnesota"
Fantastic exhibits!,Really well done museum! Lots of different kinds of birds and tons of different information about the evolution of birds. Exhibits are both in Spanish and English so it's a great place if you don't speak much Spanish.,Date of experience: April 2017,Museo de las Aves,1,"Saltillo, Mexico"
"Good value, friendly staff","I stayed here for business while in Saltillo. It's a little removed from the center of the city but is easy to get to if you have a car. If you don't have a car I would suggest a different more centrally located hotel.

Breakfast was good and had a selection of breads, fruits, and other breakfast foods.
I would stay here again if I was looking for a good a value hotel!",Date of stay: April 2017,Holiday Inn Express Saltillo Zona Aeropuerto,1,"Saltillo, Mexico"
It's a museum and a zoo!!,"Great place to check out while in Saltillo! Make sure you can speak/read Spanish or it's not worth the visit.
Si hablas espanol debes ir!

Don't bother buying a map, once you get inside you just follow the path to the left and there are maps posted throughout the museum.
After you get done with the museum part you walk through the small but active zoo. Walk up the platforms to make sure you see all of the animals.",Date of experience: April 2017,Museo del Desierto,1,"Saltillo, Mexico"
Food was ok but the timing and the service was sub par.,"After a long day at the Grand Canyon we came back to Williams and decided to try out this place; mistake. The food came out at all different times. One entree came out at the same time as the appetizer, even though we order the app as soon as we sat down. 15 minutes later the other entree came out. We never got smaller plates for the app even though the waitress said she would go grab them and be right back.

Their prices are too high for this kind of service. Try the place across the street, it's much better.",Date of visit: April 2017,Grand Canyon Brewing Company,1,"Williams, Arizona"
The Best thing to do and eat in Page!!,"My wife and I were looking for a place to eat dinner and we discovered this place!! What an amazing experience! The staff was great and super friendly and the food and entertainment were out of this world.

Go and have a relaxing evening with live music and Navajo dancers! Make sure to get a lavender lemonade, they are delicious!",Date of visit: April 2017,Into the Grand,1,"Page, Arizona"
Just as cool at all of the picture!!,"This place really is as cool as all of the pictures you see of it.

It's about a 15 minute walk out over the hill to see the canyon but totally worth it. If you have time to visit at different times of day the Canyon and river have a completely different atmosphere.",Date of experience: April 2017,Horseshoe Bend,1,"Page, Arizona"
Relaxing Private Couples Bath,My wife and I were in town and wanted to do a soak in the hot spring water just for the fun of it. It was very nice and relaxing and overall a good experience. The bath was reasonably priced and we both felt like it was worth the experience. You could also purchase access their pool however we were limited on time and the private bath was the perfect amount.,Date of experience: February 2017,Quapaw Baths & Spa,1,"Hot Springs, Arkansas"
Best Views,We stopped here for dinner our last night in town. The place is right along the beach and there isn't a bad seat in the house. The food was good but a little overpriced for how much you got. You are really paying for the views. If you like seafood and watching the waves crash along the beach then this is the place for you.,Date of visit: February 2017,Pompano Joe's,1,"Miramar Beach, Florida"
Great Dolphin Cruises,We loved this trip! They took you out into the bay as well as the gulf and followed around Dolphins. They let you know where to look and are really engaging and fun. I've been to a lot of different beach towns and attractions and this one tops them all. Make sure you see the dolphins while you're in Destin. They love the attention.,Date of experience: February 2017,Southern Star Dolphin Cruise,1,"Destin, Florida"
Best Place in OKC,A friend recommended this place and it was great!! We had never heard of them before so we had no clue that they offer complementary chips and queso as well as a desert at the end of your meal. Our waiter was a little odd but he New his stuff and the food was right out. Highly recommend this place!,Date of visit: February 2017,Ted's Cafe Escondido Edmond,1,"Edmond, Oklahoma"
Fantastic Place with GREAT service!!!,"My wife and I were looking for a more local place that we could get a quick lunch and for S&Bs. This place has fantastic burgers! There are so many different and unique options that you will need to go back. We got the smothered fries and two of the special burgers and everything was great.
The service in particular made this a great trip. Derek was our server and he did a good job of helping us look through the menu and answered any questions we had. He excitement and energy about everything they did made us enjoy the whole experience that much more. Highly recommend it!",Date of visit: February 2017,S&B Burger Joint,1,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma"
Fun Place!,"We went here our first night in town and we're very happy with it. Great atmosphere locales in stock yard city, where all of the cattle come in to be traded.

The food was amazing! Great place for a good steak. Make sure you go up straits to the old salon style room while you wait to be seated. You can get a drink and watch sports.",Date of visit: January 2017,Cattlemen's,1,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma"
Great Value Zoo!,"I was impressed with how many different exhibits this zoo had. We went on BOGO Tuesday without knowing it and it did not feel crowded at all! The animals were active and many exhibits had feeding times posted so you could plan you day and see as much as possible.
The only down side were the paths to nowhere. The design of the walking path has you walking past long parts of nothing and causes you to double back. Overall, good day.",Date of experience: February 2017,Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden,1,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma"
Cool building and location,My wife and I stopped in here for a quick bit to eat while we were walking around Hot Springs. The beer was really good and they have quite a selection. It's made with the Springs water that comes up through the bottom of the building; it's pretty interesting. The food was just alright. Prices were reasonable and the staff was very attentive. Fun place for lunch.,Date of visit: February 2017,Superior Bathhouse Brewery,1,"Hot Springs, Arkansas"
Fun place to explore!,"This is pretty much it for the national park however it's pretty cool to see everything how it was 100 years ago. They have all of the different floors on display and exhibited that explain what everything was back then. Highly recommend stopping in if you are already in town or if it's close to you. We drove five hours to the town and decided to cut the trip short because we ran out of things to do. That being said, stop by the Fordyce place, it's pretty cool!",Date of experience: February 2017,Fordyce Bathhouse,1,"Hot Springs, Arkansas"
Great place!,"This place has a great atmosphere and delicious food! The menu is really big and hard decide because you have to order before you sit down. Over all it's worth it. Make sure to get the fries, they are some of the best I've had.",Date of visit: January 2017,The Garage,1,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma"
Never again...,"This place was beyond disgusting... toilets attached sideways to the wall so they can fit, trash cans with food still left in them from the previous guests, and the unsafe feeling like you shouldn't be put past dark. To top that all off they lied when we called to ask about a handicap accessible room, they don't have any. A bathtub is not the same as roll in shower. Sorry but I won't make this mistake again.",Date of stay: December 2016,Howard Johnson by Wyndham Oklahoma City,1,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma"
"Fun waiter, good food!","We had a great time at the Mackinac Grille. Our waiter was fun and entertaining. The food was delicious and perfect for the cold breeze that was coming in off the straights. The meatloaf was really good, the pasty was huge, and the parmesan crusted chicken was amazing!",Date of visit: September 2016,Mackinac Grille,1,"Saint Ignace, Michigan"
The best of the best!,My wife and I were on the island last week and decided to try all of the different fudge shops. After sampling them all there and once we got home we decided that JoAnn's is one of the best on the island. We tried five different shops but none of them were as creamy and smooth as JoAnn's. We loved it!,Date of visit: September 2016,JoAnn's Fudge,1,"Mackinac Island, Michigan"
Nice view right down by the water,The pink pony is right on the little bay and offers an outdoor patio to have lunch and dinner on out side. The prices aren't bad for the island and being right on he water. The fish tacos are good as well as the French Dip sandwich. Not a bad spot!,Date of visit: September 2016,Pink Pony,1,"Mackinac Island, Michigan"
Fun place!!,It looks like it's the only bar in town but it's worth a visit. The food is good and priced reasonably. The inside looks like a pine log cabin with views of the harbor and an upstairs seating area. We went for dinner twice and the western burger is delicious.,Date of visit: September 2016,Dixie Saloon,1,"Mackinaw City, Michigan"
Best way to the island!!!,"Sheplers is the best way to get to the island. It's quick and the staff is friendly and willing to help. You can buy tickets online, at the gate, or at your hotel. We saved a few bucks getting them at the hotel. There are other cheaper options but they take way longer and don't seem to have a bridge view trip option. Great service!",Date of experience: September 2016,Shepler's Mackinac Island Ferry,1,"Mackinaw City, Michigan"
Good value,"This place is clean, cheap, and close by to the ferry marina and the downtown walking area. The breakfast have a good selection for a free breakfast and the pool is great. Indoor so it can be used regardless of the weather, the pool, sauna, and hot tub are all great. Beachfront rooms are only a cheeky upgrade away!!",Date of stay: September 2016,Super 8 by Wyndham Mackinaw City/Beachfront Area,1,"Mackinaw City, Michigan"
"Good place, great food!","The Fife Lake Inn is a great stop if you're staying in fife lake or the surrounding areas. They have a fantastic selection of food and drinks. It's a little pricey, but the food is really good.",Date of visit: September 2016,Fife Lake Inn,1,"Fife Lake, Michigan"
"Nice hotel, Centrally located",Just stayed at the Aria and had a great time! The location of the Aria is set back off the main strip but still central enough to feel like you're part of the action. With a quick walk to a Walgreens and some fast food it can also be a more affordable choice than some other high end hotels. The tram to the Bellaggio it's only 10-15 mins away from fountains and more.,Date of stay: June 2016,ARIA Resort & Casino,1,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
Best Show in Vegas,The Bellagio Fountains are the best show in Vegas. Be sure to go after 8:00pm so that you can stay and watch multiple shows. They run every 15 mins till midnight. Great mixture of shows and song types.,Date of experience: June 2016,Fountains of Bellagio,1,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
"Great food, friendly service and a cool atmosphere",My wife and I went there for lunch on Sunday. The place was quite but nice to sit down and enjoy watching the many different TVs.

Great sports bar.,Date of visit: July 2015,Brann's Steakhouse & Sports Grille,1,"Grand Rapids, Michigan"
So slow,I've been waiting for over 30 minutes for two limeades. It's not a huge order and they should have had it to us in half the time. Yea they were busy but everyone car around us left and they ordered food after us.,Date of visit: July 2015,Sonic Drive-In,1,"Wyoming, Michigan"
Cute little place,Awesome little garden supply store. Also great place to stop for ice cream! They have good prices on Mulch and have a lot of yard decorations if you're into that sort of thing.,Date of visit: July 2015,Sticks N Stones Etc,1,"Pierson, Michigan"
A must if you like Cherries!!!,"Traverse City is know for all of their cherry things but this shop is great anything you would want to have cherries in and they have it. From amazing salsa to BBQ sauce, they have tasters so you can really get the feel of the flavor before buying it. A must if you're going to traverse city.",Date of experience: July 2015,American Spoon,1,"Traverse City, Michigan"
Best Breakfast in Town,Awesome breakfast. And it's worth the wait. The wait can be a little while but they can text you when your table is ready so it's nice and easy and you don't have to wait inside. The food is awesome and the atmosphere is very unique and fun. It's a great place!,,Anna's House,1,"Grand Rapids, Michigan"
Awesome burgers and a cool atmosphere,Stella's is a cool place to go and hang out with some friends and get a bit to eat. You have to try one of their famous burgers. Technically it's a whiskey bar but don't let that turn you away if you're not into whiskey. The atmosphere is different but very fun!,,Stella's Lounge,1,"Grand Rapids, Michigan"
Good place from breakfast!,It's all about their early morning specials. Get a good amount of food for a good price. Great location right in east town! A filling breakfast at a good price.,,Wolfgang's Restaurant,1,"Grand Rapids, Michigan"
Delicious Beer,Great atmosphere to meet people. Awesome beers and great selection. Fun place to hang out with friends and grab a beer after work.,,Founders Brewing Co.,1,"Grand Rapids, Michigan"
Overpriced coffee,It's a fun location right downtown but the coffee is over priced and it seems like there is hardly ever a place to sit. I'd much rather go to a Starbucks.,,MadCap Coffee Company,1,"Grand Rapids, Michigan"
Try the sugar bread!!!,Great breakfast spot! The sugar bread is a must try. Friendly service and good food for a decent price. Kalamazoo location is much better than the one on Byron Center Road.,,The Red Geranium Cafe,1,"Grand Rapids, Michigan"
Bacon bacon and more bacon!,So much bacon. It was delicious. My wife and I went there and both ordered BLTs. We ate as much bacon as we could fit on the sandwich and still left with an entire take out box full of bacon. Good value.,,Tony's I-75 Restaurant,1,"Birch Run, Michigan"
Obviously a must!,It is as great in really life as the movies and pictures. Make sure you walk around the building right on the harbor. The best pictures can be take by boat looking back at the city. A lot of bars and fun things to do at night!,,Sydney Harbour,1,"Sydney, Australia"
Very nice and relaxing park,So many cool plants and a lot of shade. We went in January and the trees were full of parrots. Some many good pictures and it was awesome to just sit under the tree and watch them.,,Royal Botanic Garden Sydney,1,"Sydney, Australia"

Great Time,We had such a great time! We saw tons of dolphins and enjoyed a nice cruise around the Destin Harbor and Bay. It's a great time!,,Southern Star Dolphin Cruise,1,"Destin, Florida"
Destination Wedding!!!,It was a hard choice at first but I'm so glad we chose Dreams for our wedding. They took care of everything! Anything that we needed they had already had for us.

We would highly recommend Dreams to anyone!,Date of stay: August 2014,Dreams Puerto Aventuras Resort & Spa,1,"Puerto Aventuras, Mexico"
Birthday Dinner,"We went here for my wife's birthday and it was very nice. HUGE free lobster dinner for your birthday. The food was great, but it was a little on the pricey end.

Great Irish Pub,"Great food and good bear. The bean soup is a most, it's only 18 cents! Fun atmosphere and one of the few late nice bars in Destin whose kitchen stays open with the bar, tasty appetizers.",,McGuire's Irish Pub,1,"Destin, Florida"
Honeymoon,"My wife and I went here on our honeymoon and while the resort was nice, the service and food was just so-so. We were greeted with a drink which was nice, but with the exception of a few service staff the staff was rude and unhelpful. The rooms were nice and large and the bathroom was modern. The worst part of the resort was the ""preferred"" guest system. We were on our honeymoon but still felt like second rate customers with a beach and areas reserved for VIP. If I would have known the difference we would have paid the difference or found a different resort.",Date of stay: February 2015,Ocean Coral & Turquesa,1,"Puerto Morelos, Mexico"
Nice cheap hotel,"It was a nice little hotel very close to the airport. It has a really nice pool and hot tub. The rooms were nice but a little small, not tons of extra room. Perfect for what we needed and was affordable. The breakfast was good but nothing special, there are a lot better breakfast places in San Jose.",Date of stay: December 2014,Wyndham Garden San Jose Airport,1,"San Jose, California"
"Cool place, good food","This is a little cool place with awesome food, fun atmosphere, and great seasonal specials. The pumpkin bisque is delicious and the sweat potato fries and the dipping sauces are a must!",,Electric Cheetah,1,"Grand Rapids, Michigan"
