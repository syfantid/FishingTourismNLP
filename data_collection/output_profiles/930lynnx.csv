So many fish!!,"Me and my friends don’t have much experience fishing but were still able to catch a ton of fish! The boat lays out nets and traps the morning of or the night before which they pull up for you. They show you the array of fish and shrimp and explain which types they are. They are the only boat on the island who can catch the small shrimps, and boy are they worth it!! Fried whole and crispy. I love shrimp and these were some of the best I’ve had. The fish and shrimp are cleaned and cooked fresh on the boat. And then you have about 3 hours to fish with a pole or hand line. I recommend the hand line, it is the traditional way they do it on the island are were much easier than using poles. The staff are very helpful and will cook any fish you pull up on the spot. After the fishing they take you on a short tour of the sights. It was a wonderful experience and highly recommended!",,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Great dive crew!,This was one of the most organized crews I've had the pleasure of diving with. Everything was neat and well planned making for a wonderful experience. They also have a photographer who takes awesome pictures which is included in the price. I had a great time!,Date of experience: December 2016,Abc Snorkel Charters,4,"Port Douglas, Australia"
Lively atmosphere,"Came here on Friday evening looking for a drink and dinner. This place has a great view of the city and a lively atmosphere. Our server was Yekaherina and she was phenomenal. She was very attentive to our needs and also very friendly. The cocktails were great! I had the hummingbird and it was probably one of the best cocktails I have had. This is a great place to come before going out for the night. The only complaint I would have is that it closes pretty early, at 11 on a friday night, even though the entire place was still packed. Would definitely recommend this restaurant and Yekaherina!",Date of visit: September 2015,Area 31,4,"Miami, Florida"
