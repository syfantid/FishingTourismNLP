Excursion trip,"I had a great trip of 30 minutes. I saw All the beautiful bay of the city of Rhodes while seeing historic monuments and learning their history on board. From the aquarium side (the north tip of the island), I saw both sides of the island. I definitely recommend it. Excellent excursion !",Date of experience: July 2019,Orca Boat Company,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
