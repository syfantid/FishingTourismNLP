Amazing experience,"We had a fabulous experience.. Very relaxed.. Excellent staff and this was all organised within 5 minutes. Read the website... Ensured we had the correct clothing.. We were willing to wait to be put into a boat expecting a delay as it was very busy but we were on the water within 5 minutes of booking in person.
. If you read the rules on line you can't go far wrong. Sensible clothing for outdoor activity is essential.. I absolutely cannot fault the staff.. Amazing experience and have already recommended. We will be back",Date of experience: September 2020,Wyedean Canoe & Adventure Centre,5,"Ross-on-Wye, United Kingdom"
Most amazing day out,"We were dubious about the trip... Old fishing boat captain barely spoke English but Wow he blew us away... We sailed out from port and he quickly got us set up with fishing lines and bait and it was clear the language was no barrier.. He made my daughter feel comfortable and confident putting bait on her line.. He was funny and very very engaging. Beautiful scenery and swimming off the boat with snorkels to be followed by the most delicious fish with fresh Greek salad beautifully served in oyster shell while overlooking Greek scenery mm the sea so clear and turquoise
Recommended this to so many friends who have visited Rhodes and tried this for themselves and all have said what, a wonderful experience and would all do it again. So relaxing and enjoyable an absolute MUST DO x",Date of experience: August 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
