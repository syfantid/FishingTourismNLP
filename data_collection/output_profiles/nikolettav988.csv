Astonishing trip,"It was an amazing tour! Mr Andreas is a great captain! We feel like we are still there, swimming in these crystal waters. The best moment was lunch!!! Captain Andreas was the chief fisherman and we tried to help him to catch fish and then we had a perfect meal with absolutely fresh fish. Almost forgot to mention the traditional treats we enjoyed, like ladenia and watermelon pie (DELICIOUS). Can't wait to visit Milos next year and of course our friend Mr Andreas!",Date of experience: July 2020,Explore Milos with Poseidon®,5,"Milos, Greece"
