Noisy but yammie,"The place was crowded which produced lots of noice. But the burger I ate was verry tasty, correctly made. Staff was friendly too. I recommend this place, but not if you are seeking a coosy restaurant.",Date of visit: August 2018,Memphis BBQ Grill,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
One of the best...,"Have been there twice. First time I ate grilled calamaris, served with cooked vegetables. That was sublime. Second time, beef ribs. The BBQ sauce, which was homemade accompagned it greatly. Overall one of these best places to eat.",Date of visit: August 2018,Louis Restaurant Pizzeria,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Well worth a visit,"From the old centre, a 45 minutes walk to this journey with history. Very nice and open site. But besides public wc and a machine selling you water there is no refreshment alternatives.",Date of experience: August 2018,Ancient Olympic Stadium - Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
You have to do this.,"Chilling, sight seeing, fishing, swimming, BBQ on boat. Every promess met. This is a true experience that you should not miss.",Date of experience: August 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Lekker,We waren met drie maar moesten met een klein tafeltje genoegen nemen. Eten was heerlijk ( fried assortiment fish) maar ober was gehaast. De moeite waard toch.,,Taverna dell'800,1,"Sorrento, Italy"
Best pizza in Sorrento,We went several times to this restaurant. The pizza's they served are close to the traditional pizza like Di Michele in Napoli.,,Il Leone Rosso Ristorante Pizzeria Sorrento,1,"Sorrento, Italy"
"Great meals, fine atmosphere, good service.","We returned several times to this restaurant during our stay at Kolymbari. Each time we were surprised by the tastfull dishes.
The Raki was fine and always we've got a dessert of the house.
Each meal was accompagned by homemade bread.
We took the housewine (red and white) and that was verry fine!

My son wanted a pasticcio but it wasn't on the menu. The owner made it for us without problem. It was delicious!

Bravo!",Date of visit: August 2013,Palio Arhontiko,1,"Crete, Greece"
Mind the one waitor...,"Food was delicious but there is one waitor ( the oldiest) that was very unfriendly. He made political statements, lets you wait and presented in purpose the wrong dish. Only because you don't have the right nationality.
I know that the crisis in Geece is hard but this goes too far..
Shame on you!",Date of visit: July 2012,Irinis Taverna,1,"Santorini, Greece"
