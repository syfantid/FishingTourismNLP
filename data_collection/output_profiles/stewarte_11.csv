Stowaway Lilly's Rhodes Adventure,"We Arrived on Wednesday 2nd August .We are a Family with two older children .
A son of 15yrs old who doesn't like heat. A daughter full of life of 13yrs old.
Also Harry the Penguin and Lilly the Stowaway Rabbit.
Our room was a split level Family room which was spacious and cleaned every day.
It was close to all facilities .Very short walk to the Beach, Bars and Restaurant.
The Restaurant was very clean with a good selection of food which was all good quality.
The Snack bar was full of delicious snacks, a wide range of ice-cream and soft drinks.
Ideal every time you wanted a snack. The Drinks bar served good range of cocktails with good measures, Wine and obviously beer which I had in good quantities.
All the Staff on site were Pleasant and friendly and seemed always pleased to see you even although they seemed to work very long hours.
The beach was Stoney .When we arrived the water was cloudy which I found dissappointing as I enjoy Snorkeling however as the wind changed direction ,Over the next day .Water became crystal clear .Snorkeling was very good but you had to search for the fish . The last two mornings were good around 8am watching Needle fish attack small fry.
Cats around the Hotel were healthy and well behaved . There were a few strays a little further along the beach which my Daughter enjoyed feeding.
Good Time entertainment were Good Fun, Full of energy but not pushy.
My Daughter and I played Water Polo which was enjoyable.I danced to play that Sax a couple of times . On the Last night I done Billy Idol Karaoke which I think everyone found Funny.
Ixia had a good range of shops but it is a very busy road to cross and the driving a bit bonkers so be careful.
Rhodes Town was fascinating and well worth a visit especially the Old Town .
We all enjoyed the Holiday even my Son who kept in the shade when not in the pool .",Date of stay: August 2017,Avra Beach Resort Hotel - Bungalows,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Daughters fishing adventure,"My Daughter Emma and I went on this fantastic trip on Sunday 6th August.
We left Harbour at 10.30 .After a cruise along the coast we then fished.
It was fun Fishing on the Drift with small baits close to the bottom . The tackle was a little worn but I was impressed they used Braid . It was ok tackle for the size of fish we were catching. Emma and I both caught three fish and had plenty of bites.
After 2hrs 30 minutes fishing we went close to the shore were we swam and snorkelled . The water was crystal clear and refreshing.
Once back on board after photo`s had a fantastic meal of fish and salad .
We were looked after very well by the captain and his two mates who were friendly and helpful .
In all a very good fun trip well worth the money",Date of experience: August 2017,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
paradise on a cliff edge,"Just returned 2 Days ago from this Hotel. We travelled as a Family with a 14yr old boy and 12yr old girl. Transfer time advertised is 90 minutes but our transfers both ways were 50 minutes .
The Hotel is big superbly located on a cliff edge with excellent views of the sea and Ciutadella . There is a lovely cove running along side the hotel ending in two small beaches only a short walk away via steps.
The rooms were very clean and modern finished to a high standard .The air con was quiet so was fine to use at night.
The restaurant was big but we were welcomed by the Head Waiter on our 1st meal who showed us around . Every meal there were waiters to welcome you.
The food was excellent with plenty of choices .
In the evening we didn`t get involved with the entertainment but went up to our rooms with drinks.
The bars were well manned and even if the queue was long only had to wait 5 minutes to be served.
One Evening we walked into town which made a nice change as it was cooler to browse around the shops and have drinks.
During the day It was lovely laying by the pools then going off to swim in the pools ,Snorkelling in the cove or just watching boats from cruise ships to rowing boats going into Ciutadella .(binoculars recommended). Obviously getting a beer or drink to regularly cool you down in the high temperatures.
The cove itself was fantastic for snorkelling very clear . Plenty to see underwater.
My Daughter and I went fishing at 1st light every morning and had great fun catching plenty of fish and 2 octopus.
The lovely Town near by was a 5 minute walk with plenty of shops and bars . Yes there were some empty but still plenty going on. The water park is 10 minutes into the town and we had a great day there.
Ciutadella is definitely worth a visit and the harbour a must . The buildings were impressive .Plenty of shops for browsing .
The only negative things to comment on were
The pool was very salty . A lot more salty than the sea and the big pool was deep 1.6m at its shallowest which ruled out water polo for me because I can`t swim or tread water for 30 minutes solid.
The other thing was the Spanish and Italian guests were very poor mannered pushing into queues .
Overall a fantastic holiday in a brilliant location .",Date of stay: August 2016,Globales Almirante Farragut,4,"Menorca, Spain"
Despite weather a wonderful holiday!!,"We stayed during the second week of August with our two children 11 and 13. Rooms are very clean. We were in rooms 220 and 221. Although concerned from previous reviews we would be too far from pool and entertainment area. We needn't have worried, as it took 5 mins to walk to pool and 8 to the restaurant. Food was excellent with plenty of choice. It was nice to be allocated a table for evening meal. All staff around the complex were excellent. Beach was clean with kayaks which were good fun. Also mini golf was good. It was a good idea for the teenagers to have their own game of waterpolo as our young daughter was able to take part. She really enjoyed it. We didn't have a problem without air con but the weather wasn't the best 3 afternoons of rain which lowered the temperature. Overall a great holiday.",Date of stay: August 2015,Iberostar Cala Domingos,4,"Majorca, Spain"

the evening entertainment was great I done karaoke and we also joined in Zorros nights which were brilliant. a couple of nights we stayed on our balcony which was very pleasant as we had unlimited supply of drink.
