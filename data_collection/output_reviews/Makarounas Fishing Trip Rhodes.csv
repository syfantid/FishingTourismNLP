0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stavros50,October 2020,5,Fantastic birthday trip,"Saw this trip advertised as we were walking along the Harbour .Did some checking and found it to be very highly recommended.Paid the €20 deposit and went on our merry way .Thursday ( my 50th birthday ) arrived and we were at the Jetty for 08:50 to fill in documentation and comply with COVID restrictions ( temperature test etc) .Skipper of the boat met us and assisted with our and other guests boarding . When all were seated he took us around the ancient harbour for great photo shots and then out to a fishing ground . The first mate ( skippers wife) laid out bait and fished out rods and gear . Scupper gave advice on what to do as well as safety brief on type of poisonous fish in these waters. On completion we went at it .Weather was great . A little swell in the water but great for fishing . I pulled four fish in ( much to my delight) . No record breakers but great sport.Following a change of fishing ground, we headed south down the east coast of Rhodes. Drinks were available throughout and acquaintances made with fellow fishermen.Arrived in a secluded cove with sea caves and tied off . Swimming and exploring were the name of the game as the crew prepared a feast of BBQ fish and Greek salad ( tasted fantastic).On completion we headed North back to port . A fantastic day out . Felt safe and secure throughout and have memories of a most wonderful day.The price was very fair (€100 for two adults) and I would happily go again .Fully recommend this to both novice and expert purely for the joy of the day. Was very surprised when the skipper produced a chocolate cake with a candle and sang happy birthday to me ..... it’s the little things that count as well . Amazing day Amazing crew Thank you very much ."

A few of us felt sick and they moved to calmer waters, checking everyone was ok.They had a good knowledge of fishing spots and assisted the less experienced!

3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/357jenniferh,September 2020,5,Brilliant day out,"The only word to describe this trip is ‘fabulous’. Great crew, lovely boat, everything provided. Went on this trip as a group of 7 adults, holiday with our adult family.  The delightful crew catered for everyone.  Starts with a sightseeing cruise along Rhodes town then off to fish for about an hour.Once lunch is caught we were taken to a small bay for swimming and snorkelling while the crew cooked a scrumptious bbq.5 hours of fun - would highly recommend this trip "

The captain and the lady (I’m sorry I can’t remember names!) we’re fantastic hosts, the hospitality was great, all drinks were included with plenty of choice. The views were wonderful and plenty of photo opportunities with a relaxed atmosphere, even in these troubling times. We fished for just over an hour and everyone and then went snorkelling in the caves and came back to fresh fish and Greek salad with watermelon for dessert.We will definitely be visiting the island again and certainly will be booking another Makarounas  trip! Look forward to seeing you again. "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/868lloydd,September 2020,5,Brilliant experience - definitely worth time and money,Fantastic experience - great views as you leave the city and then some brilliant fun fishing for a couple of hours. Quick swim around the caves and hop back out for you bbq’d fish for lunch/dinner. Great fun and trying to persuade my other half to do a second trip in the same week.
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HannesDG94,August 2020,5,One time experience!,We really enjoyed our time at this trip. It was a one time experience. I could recommend this trip to everyone! Jasmin and Wasselis were really nice people. The food was really good! See you next time!
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sepreviews,August 2020,5,Brilliant trip,"Brilliant day out! It was a lovely relaxed and chilled atmosphere, left at 9am and fished for an hour or so, I think nearly everyone on our trip (9 people) caught a fish! We then stopped at a little bay where you could snorkel round the Ancient caves whilst they barbecued the fresh fish on board the boat! (When we booked the trip we were asked if we wanted chicken or fish so if you don’t like eating fish there is another option) the lunch was delicious and the setting was beautiful it was a great day out."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/898glynw,August 2020,5,Beautiful day out fishing & snorkeling with a delicious BBQ if a little windy!,"Makarounas is one of those little gems that you occasionally find while on holiday.  Primarily, wanted to try some fishing. This trip certainly delivers plus lots more.  The captain is very amenable, friendly and helpful,  as is the lovely lady who assisted him. The grilled fish was delicious with a large portion of Greek Salad followed by a refreshing slice of water melon.  The caves we visited are interesting and full of marine life.  Be careful when swimming near the rocks.  It's very easy to graze a knee or your back like I did .  We took our own snorkeling equipment but you can borrow theirs if you're comfortable to do so.  All in all a good day out which was lots of fun.  Thanks! "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrishZ2103GP,August 2020,5,brilliant trip,"We had a fabulous day on this trip. A boat trip, few hours fishing,( everyone caught a few ) . Then swimming and snorkeling near the caves while the fish was being cooked on the bbq.  The smell was amazing, so back to the boat to eat. A must do trip."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loukyluke,August 2020,5,One of the best deals in Rhodes,We went on a fishing trip with Makarounas today and it was fantastic. One of our friends felt sick of the sea and they took care of him. Captain Vasilis and Mrs Asimina were very polite and kind. We went fishing and had a bbq on board. Food was great and overall a great experiennce. Only thing id change is to have a bit more time to fish other than that 10000% recommend it. You won't regret it i promise.

2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike-Helsingborg1,July 2020,5,Thoroughly enjoyable trip.,"Wanted a boat trip, to see some sights, do some swimming around the caves. Booked last minute and went out. The fishing was fun, we didn’t really want to do the fishing -  but when we started we couldn’t stop. So much fun and we all caught a few fish!The caves swim was nice - they provided snorkelling gear, life jackets etc - but we didn’t bring our swimming shoes so couldn’t climb up on the rocks.The BEST part was lunch. It was excellent!  fresh fish, Greek salad, bread and watermelon. The pictures speak for themselves. This trip is definitely worth a go."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurenth848,July 2020,5,Unforgettable day. Thank you!,An amazing trip on the Makarounas. The captain and the crew are here to make this moment unforgettable. Either you will make with your family or friends this the place to be in Rhodes.

3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jelifish77,May 2020,5,Most amazing day out,"We were dubious about the trip... Old fishing boat captain barely spoke English but Wow he blew us away... We sailed out from port and he quickly got us set up with fishing lines and bait and it was clear the language was no barrier.. He made my daughter feel comfortable and confident putting bait on her line.. He was funny and very very engaging. Beautiful scenery and swimming off the boat with snorkels to be followed by the most delicious fish with fresh Greek salad beautifully served in oyster shell while overlooking Greek scenery mm the sea so clear and turquoise Recommended this to so many friends who have visited Rhodes and tried this for themselves and all have said what, a wonderful experience and would all do it again. So relaxing and enjoyable an absolute MUST DO x"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E_A_T_finn,September 2019,5,"Great trip, excellent service!","I was on holiday in September 2019 with my 2 teenagers. My 14 y old son loves to fish here in Finland. He wanted to fishing also in Rhodes. Even though my girl and I are not interested of fishing, we had great time. We mostly enjoyed the sun and good food. The service was super-friendly, so I was not afraid to let my son go again alone to fishing trip without me. The crew were very kind to my son, even though he was afraid, how he would manage with his english. Everything went great. I hope we’ll meet soon!"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Camper524986,October 2019,5,The best fishing trip ever!,"What an incredible experiance this fishing trip was! 5 hour fishing trip with view on the Rhodes old town from the sea, great opportunity to teach the little ones how to fish and fishing for Tuna trolling! Truly unforgettable experience. Fresh fish for dinner, great salad and amazing toasted bread! Got a good footage with out underwater camera while swimming so really pleased with that. Capitan was even kind enough to let our son hold steering wheel for good 40 mins. Well deserved 5 stars! We will definitely be back there shortly!"

2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D7388DNraymondm,October 2019,4,Great day out ,"Took this trip on a Friday before leaving, . Started off with a trip round the bay to see the old town , then headed out to sea , where we spent an hour going round in circles so the skipper could trawl for tuna . Spent about 2-3hours fishing then headed into a bay for a swim and lunch , personally, I’d have preferred to spend more time fishing , it’s a fishing trip ???"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissyTMaggee,October 2019,5,Wondering day on the sea.,"I cannot recommend this trip enough. Half day out on the sea was only €35. You got so much for your money. A peaceful journey around the coast on a small fishing vessel with complimentary beer and wine or soft drinks to get you in a relaxed mood then a good hour or so of fishing which was very easy so don't be put off if you've never had any experience. And to top it off the fish you catch is cooked for you and presented beautifully with bread and salad. You can't get better than catching and eating your own fish. while this is being prepared for you you can jump over board and have the swim in the beautiful clear sea and there are snorkels and masks provided so you can get a real view of what is down under the waves. The crew were lovely locals, funny and charming in their own down to earth way. This is a wonderful trip for anyone who wants to stay away from the larger commercial trips. Real food, real people in a beautiful surrounding.we went today and now we are even discussing going again before we go home. This is a kind of trip that wonderful memories make. We would like to thank the crew for giving us such a great day out."

3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickiengland20,September 2019,5,Brilliant Day Out,"We had a fantastic afternoon fishing on this very well organised trip with a really personal feel. The guys were good fun, knowledgeable and seemed to really enjoy hosting us. They were always on hand to help us and ensured we didn’t catch any unwanted fish ... e.g. the dragon fish. The lunch was superb ... all cooked on board on a little BBQ. Would highly recommend for the experienced or non-experienced as it’s not too serious. "

Having no experience in fishing, they tough us how to fish and of course we all managed to catch something lol or at least to get the feeling of it. We had a great time and of course eating BBQ fish on the boat was such cool experience. Definitely recommend doing this with the duo, good family vibes. Thank you again :-)"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jo4686,September 2019,5,Brilliant Day!,"Googled fishing in Rhodes and this was rated number one on trip adviser so decided to go with it.

We did not have any experience fishing but still managed to catch a couple small ones due to the very friendly crash course and expertise of the crew! Plenty of time for fishing, and we even made a second stop. To top it up some snorkeling while Vassilis expertly prepares the days catch and some fresh salad and a nice trip back to the harbor!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rainb0w00,September 2019,5,Unforgettable day!!!,"An amazing way to start your day. We booked from 9am-1pm trip and was just perfect. The only bothering thing was a very strong wind, but we survived :) Must do it if you are in Rhodos! "
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TommyB1990,September 2019,5,What an experience!,"Me and my girlfriend booked this fishing trip and absolutely loved it! Both men on board were very friendly, welcoming and helpful. You get great views of Rhodes on your way to the fishing spot too.We caught plenty of fish between us and a variety which was excellent. Dragon fish and puffer fish been two for example. Whilst we were fishing the captain prepared a greek salad, once we were finished they take you to a nice spot to go snorkeling while they bbq the fish you caught. Would highly recommend this trip for anyone. I enjoy fishing but my girlfriend has never really done much... she thought it was brilliant. Best trip we have both been on "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tennisizer,August 2019,5,Free drinks and fresh lunch prepared for you,"One of the highlights of our trip.  Where else can you go fishing and the captain prepares your catch for your while you swim?  The lunch setup is super cute where they have your cooked fish, salad, and a side of bread for you all prepared for you at the ""table"" so when you hop back on the boat after your swim, all you do is eat.  With the food scraps you throw them into the water and a bunch of fish will fight over it.  It was fun watching that.  The fishing we caught that day were all very tiny though, so don't expect any big catch?  I'd def. recommend this fun half day trip with Makarounas if you are sick of lounging at the beach."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elimizra,August 2019,5,Great experience!,"I highly recommend fishing with Vasilis, the best fisherman in greece.

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meandmyboys1,August 2019,5,Our First Family Fishing trip!,"What a great experience. So lovely to see Rhodes from the water, great fishing experience for all members of the family. Our 5+7 year old boys loved it. The guys on board were great,  jumping in and helping out when our 5 year old started to get a little sad that he had not caught a fish and his brother had! He ended up with 3 fish and lots of nibbles!Stopped off for some snorkelling and a delicious BBQ lunch, as others have said, it really is one of the nicest and will surely be the most memorable meal of our trip.All in all, a fantastic trip and would highly recommend it."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steveontour2020,August 2019,5,Brilliant,"This is the life, totally chilled out crew, advice for those new to fishing and free food and drinks. You can swim in the sea and you're pretty much guaranteed to catch fish. The fresh barbequed Dorado was absolutely delicious, sure there are other fishing trips, but the crew make it for me, highly recommended."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/antheam2014,August 2019,5,Fantastic Experience !!,"Cannot recommend this enough! I had two teenage boys with me and we were all looked after from the moment we boarded the boat. As many soft drinks as we wanted and the crew were so friendly. Fishing was fun although due to high wind there weren’t as many as we had hoped for - I caught two (small ones) and the boys caught one, but still had a lot of fun trying. Couple of guys caught dragon fish which was exciting! Swimming was great and lunch was sensational! Highly recommend this trip for an afternoon or morning - I caught the bug and want to go fishing again! Five stars️️️️️"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dommo1968,August 2019,5,Brilliant,"According to my moody 16 year old this was the ‘best day yet!’. Really authentic trip.

It was amazing to see the port and old town from the water. Then on to fishing, very helpful staff showing and helping people who had never fished. The fish were almost instantly on the bite. Nothing to big but plenty of little ones for the Bbq. After a while we moved spots to even more fish then on to the swimming spot. We used the mask that the boat had and spent a good 20mins looking at all the different fish and animals on the sea floor. This was followed by a fantastic Bbq of fresh fish, Greek salad, Bread and Fruit oh and of course plenty to drink. We can't say a bad word about our experience"

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/watermelon77,July 2019,5,fantastic experience,"We were a family group of 7 people, 5 adults and 2 kids (age 9 and 12).This trip was a highlight of our holiday. The captain and his mate were so helpful and patient it was a delight to be onboard. We had loads of fishing time and jumped in from the boat to snorkel. The captain grilled the amazing fresh fish on the BBQ and served it with delicious bread and greek salad, we all agreed it was the best meal of the holiday, it was incredible. Considering the meal was included in the cost it was such great value for money.The trip is wonderful for families and all ages, we had an amazing time and would highly recommend it."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sseverin1234,July 2019,5,10yr old 1st fishing boat trip,"Lovely traditional fishing boat, with plenty of room for 10 -12 persons.. The crew were great, serving drinks (unlimited), telling you about the local area and helping everyone fish with rods over the side of the boat..They helped our boy bait the line and spent time teaching him techniques and how to tell when the fish were biting and when to pull your road up and start reeling in. The bait was shrimp and the fish loved it... We caught lots put back into the sea a few as they were too small to eat.Captain cooked lunch on the bbq at end of boat, Fresh fish including any fish we caught.. If you dont like fish, you could choose from chicken or pork all served with a greek salad. Great day, great fun, and price good..."

4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orengili,July 2019,5,Great fishing day,"My family and I had the chance to experience fishing at Rhodes. Not only the fishing was big fun, the owner was an amazing host. First we sailed along the walls and watched the inside of the port and old Rhodes from the see side. Then we sailed to fish. We catch some nice fish all of us  using the boat gear   The boat is well organized with good gear, small bits cups, good fishing rods, benches, shade and small chairs. The owner was very helpful and with a friendly attitude. We changed location to shallow water had a swim , some were snorkeling, while the fish where grilled on board. The taste was great, fish and greek salad, drinks and nice sweet watermelon. It was great time, high recommended.   "

2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammyjenkins89,July 2019,5,Great fishing trip!,"Had never been on a fishing trip before, my boyfriend convinced me this would be a great way to spend our last day in Rhodes. Managed to catch a dragon fish and some other little ones, quite enjoyed it considering I thought fishing was ""boring"".Beer, soft drinks, great bbq with salad and garlic bread. Captain and his mate very friendly and helpful.Only downside is my boyfriend waking up today with food poisioning. I don't eat fish and I am okay. Only thing it could have been was the fish. Apart from that would 100% recommend this experience to all!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jezzy71,July 2019,5,The best way to spend a hot afternoon. ,"We had not been on a fishing trip before and Makarounas was recommended by the people I was Scuba diving with. Both my wife and I absolutely loved it. Captain Vassilis and his mate where superb, nothing too much trouble and super helpful with fishing tips. With 12 on board we caught around 14 fish and had a blast in the process. Then on to a little bay for snorkelling whilst Captain cooked (see what I done there). The BBQ was the best, worthy of 5*s on its own. Beer was flowing, as with all drinks on board completely complementary and then a half hour or so trip back to the harbour admiring the views and relaxing. Excuse the pic of the awesome food, Wife had placed her garlic bread on the fish"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/186maryannep,July 2019,5,Best fishing trip ever!!,"Me and my partner decided to go on a fishing trip in Rhodes, wow what can I say it took our breaths away! The service on board was amazing. We caught loads of fish, and I struggled with fishing and the kind gentleman helped me, and I ended up catching two fish in one go! The highlight of our trip was the Fresh fish BBQ and Fresh salad and fruit. Best fish I have ever eat! We also went snorkelling which was lovely to cool off. Anyone looking to book a fishing trip You won't be dissapointed with this company !! 10/10! Thank you for making this an amazing memory for us :) Mary and Christian x"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marionj135,July 2019,5,A great change from usual boat trips!,"The best bit about the trip is that there are only 10 people at a time, which makes it far more friendly and fun than some of the other boat trips on offer (100+ people). Antonio was a great captain, very patient with those who hadn't fished before. The trip we were on was 4 hours and we fished, swam and had a lovely lunch of fish, salad and bread, Oh not to forget the beers! All in all a great way to spend a morning!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lbyton,June 2019,5,Never fished before but this was so good!,"So my boyfriend was keen to go on a fishing trip and was absolutely buzzing about this trip. I originally was not so much....but I took a sea sickness tablet and thought I’d give it a go! We first set sail and it was a bit rocky but it was okay! I was such a novice and struggled to catch anything at first but I caught one fish, so I was happy! My boyfriend and all the other members of the boat were catching loads, including puffer fish (which you cant eat but are nice to see!) it was so calm sat on the sea under the shaded canopy.The team were always around to give you any tips to help you! After some time fishing we stopped off for snorkelling while the team cooked up what we had caught. This was my highlight of the trip. Sitting looking out to the sea eating bbq fish caught and cooked within a couple of hours was amazing. The crew threw bread into the water to attract the fish and they were all jumping out of the water. Beers and soft drinks were available and offered throughout. It was lovely sat at the front of the boat with a cold beer staring out into the sea!My boyfriend came away saying it was definitely his highlight and I’ve got to say I would definitely do it again too! Thanks to the whole team! We even recommended you guys to a couple back at the hotel!"

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cwright101,June 2019,5,Such a special fishing trip,"We went out on the afternoon trip, just two couples had booked the trip, early June so less travellers. We were made to feel so special, guidance and help for fishing. Swimming in the sea and a bit of boat sightseeing too. It was my husbands birthday and he was given a candle in his sweet and greetings sung to him. There is a toilet on board. The presentation of the food was outstanding. Good choice of drinks."

We were out for nearly 5 hours typical Greek fishing boat stopped 3 places for fishing before dropping anchor for a swim while the fish were cooked on the barbecue on the boat served with Greek salad and wine or beer.

Overall experience was AMAZING!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nannygel,May 2019,5,Most Unique Sunday Lunch I Have Experienced,"I am in my early seventies and to be honest when I saw the relatively small aged fishing boat, my heart sank, especially as I was suffering with an excess of the all inclusive wine from the night before. To make matters worse the sea was choppy but the amazing Captain Makaroynas came to the rescue with seasickness pills and then served the most delicious lunch of the holiday. The actual fishing was really it for me, but taken as a whole a great day out."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28kadim,May 2019,5,Highly recommended ❤️,"Highlight to our trip. Really recommend to everyone!!!Best wishes to the crew, they where very nice and made sure that all the passengers got a trip of a lifetime. BEST food in RHODOS. "

0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Starwinder1,May 2019,5,Highlight of Rhodes!,"I could not recommend this enough. A 4/5 hour trip with meal and all the fish you can catch the price is excellent.The captain Vasilis is very friendly and helpful, especially when my girlfriend who very occasionally gets seasick began to feel ill for a few minutes. He was always on hand to help if we needed anything and is a very good cook everything was grilled perfectly and the fish is the freshest fish you will ever have, as its only just been caught.Next time we visit Rhodes we will definitely be taking this trip again."

The Greek salad with our bbq fish made the experience complete after a swim in the very clear sea. The on board fishermen were a joy to spend your time with and always ready to assist and advise. I would recommend this trip over all of the others if you are interested in trying your hand at sea fishing."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hhaticeaskar,October 2018,5,Was the greatest excursion we experienced in Rhodes,Great food with knowlodgeable local fisherman Vasilis. He was very friendly with kids. His tour around the city and swimming stops in half a day is a must.

0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandyb5061,October 2018,5,Perfect day at sea,"Had a fantastic day....4 trips in one. 1.Took us around the harbour by sea. 2.2to 2.5 hours fishing  3. Went close to beach so those that wanted to swim could. While... 4. Good bbq was prepared. The fish we hooked was added to the bbq and served with a salad. Well worth the money, we would highly recommend."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reannej2018,October 2018,2,Sacrificed a day of our holiday!,"This trip was a fantastic day out, we had a lovely few hours sea fishing and then a meal cooked for us on the BBQ. Which was also very nice, I'm not a big fish fan so I had chicken which was seasoned lovely. My partner had the fresh fish caught that day, which I tried and really wish I'd had the fish instead! However, the hygiene on the boat was extremely poor. There wasn't any soap or hand sanitizer to use after handling the raw bait which had been given to us in plastic cups. There were some pieces of bait already in the cups so you can imagine how long that was sat there in the baking sun! Anyway, a few hours after arriving back at the hotel, my partner began to feel ill. And not long after he started with diarrhoea and sickness, which lasted throughout the night and the next day. Therefore we missed out on a day of our holiday! My advice would be, take some hand sanitizer on board with you and don't put your hands anywhere near your mouth afterwards. Common sense, but just as a warning to others!"

Meanwhile the crew had prepared lunch (see photos) which included BBQ'd fish caught by people on the boat. Presentation was original to say the least.A great day out with 3 trips rolled into one.

Vassily took us to few places to find and fish fish and indeed we got plenty of it. On the way he offered water and other drinks but when we stoped for a short swimming brake he cooked a very tasty fish meal for us.It was a real nice trip "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnL2617,July 2018,5,Highlight of the holiday ,What a brilliant day!! Fishing was great ww caught 32 between 10 of us on the boat which where cooked for us along with some fresh sea bream the captain's friend who he works as a pro fisherman in the winter with caught that very morning. Non fish eaters got a big bbq chicken breast all cooked meat and fish was served with a big shell of Greek salad and some toasted bread followed by watermelon for afters. It was amazing! Even the salad was sliced and diced on the boat while we were fishing. We stopped at a really nice spot before the bbq to have a swim and a snorkel it was such a great day the crew where amazing. Beer and soft drinks like coke and water are available all trip just ask a crew member. I'd love to do this trip again! 
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferL3339,July 2018,5,Highly recommend!,"We went as a family of 4 having seen the trip on trip advisor before travelling. We were not disappointed.

Drinks available all trip and our son even drove the boat! Thank you so much x"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiaPralina,July 2018,5,Amazing!,"Best thing we did in the whole week! Extremely friendly staff. One person in our company chosed chicken instead of fish for the meal. When time came for cooking, the captain realized that he forgot to bring chicken. We told him that it was okay, but he sent an employee swimming to the shore to pick up chicken brought there from another member of the staff, and then he swom back to the boat with the chicken held above the surface. Just 11 people on board at the time makes it nice. Bring water, since the only drink included is with the meal at the end of the trip."

The trip itself was just lovely. Starting with a short trip viewing the old town from the harbour, then after a short journey on to fishing in a couple of different spots with plenty of shade and cold drinks on hand bobbing along with the crew on hand for much needed advice on catching fish.From there a swimming stop in crystal clear waters while the lovely crew cooked up the days catch, which was delicious. Highly recommended we will definitely be back"

2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jilliane335,July 2018,5,"Fun, fishing and food","Really relaxed and friendly fishing trip along the coast of Rhodes with our two teenage daughters.  The captain and his son (I think) were super friendly and couldn't do more for you.  The fishing was fun but the highlight was jumping off the boat for a swim and the delicious food for tea.  The boat had hand made individual tables for eating and drinking and food was served on a wooden board with salad in a shell.  Plenty to drink and lovely company.  The afternoon was great value for money and more importantly, a really happy memory.  I'd totally recommend this crew."

0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mylinhl,July 2018,5,MUST-DO IN RHODES,We went on the fishing trip and it was absolutely fantastic. The service was amazing and the captain is really nice and friendly. During the city tour you had a beautiful view of the city. We caught many fishes and ate them later on. They even prepared chicken for the ones who couldn‘t eat fish. It was very delicious!! Because it was the birthday of one of us they also brought cake! I really recommend this trip for anyone who’s on Rhodes. It was beyond our expectations and you‘re really missing out if you don’t go. It‘s really really worth the price (50€ per person food and drinks included).
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BatKick,June 2018,5,Amazing fishing trip,"We had done a lot of research on the best fishing trip and this one came up top, mostly because it involved cooking some of the fish as well, which we liked the idea of. The trip completely exceeded our expectations. We had THE BEST day of the entire holiday!! Vasilli was a great teacher, really friendly, patient and helpful. We caught a fair few small fish (the rods are quite small) and had multiple chances to catch fish in different places. After a good few hours fishing we went towards a lovely beach with beautiful clear water for a swimming break, followed by amazing barbequed fish including some of what we caught. The Greek salad was also the best I had in Rhodes. Absolutely loved it. In total we were there from 9 -2 and had an amazing morning! Well worth the money!"

Even my girlfriend who hates fishing, and hates eating fish, was smiling the whole day, as she caught a lot, and had a nice meal with a beautiful sea view. Thank you. For that money HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

Vasilli was so helpful, patient haha and friendly.He made sure we had drinks, knew what we were doing and that we had fun.We caught 14 fish between us, swam in the ocean and ate one of the nicest meals.If we wasn't leaving on Saturday, I would do it again!! So far my favourite experience on the island. You just can't fault this experience at all.You have to give it a try!!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1999LOpaulm,May 2018,5,Brilliant day out. We highly recommend it,"We had a fantastic day out today. The captain was such a great host and chef, he was very good fun too. He taught my girlfriend how to fish for the first time and we both caught a lot of fish. We stopped for a swim and snorkel whilst he prepared the food which was amazing. It was worth the price for the food alone and we both enjoyed the beer.We would both highly recommend it to anyone as the captain was so accommodating. My partner does not like eating fish or fishing but still really enjoyed the trip and food and said it was the highlight of our holiday so far. We will definitely be back.Thank youPaul and Courtnay"

4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/230mixalism,May 2018,5,Καταπληκτικό,Amazing experience and perfect activity to spend some time from your vacation. I suggest that you should do it without any hesitation.
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikolakopczynska,May 2018,5,Amazing and cheap!,"Absolutely amazing! 50 euros per person for 4.5hrs trip from New Town (opposite Starbucks coffee shop) 10 minutes drive from Sentido Ixian Grand hotel (11-14euros taxi). My boyfriend is a fisher man so we decided to go, they give you rods, you get to fish, I got to catch 3 and so did my boyfriend! After fishing you get to swim in very nice clear water, then they barbecue the fishes that everyone catches, served with salad and sparkling wine.9-10 people on the boat maximum, very nice experience, worth the money, the lady Joanna will talk you through everything before booking it :) I would definitely recommend it 100% ! Have a look at the lovely pictures I have attached."

3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milenap628,April 2018,5,Fishing trip,Amazing time with great team of proffesional fishermans. Good atmosphere and beautiful food with wine and Greek music...highly recommended :)
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lDrMiguelx,September 2017,5,So good we did it twice!!!,"I had to persuade my partner on this one as she isn’t a big fan of fishing however this trip helped me to show her how fun it can be. We decided to give this specific trip a go as it was small and only held a maximum of 10 people at one time so we weren’t cramped. On board were two gentlemen running the trip, the boss and his first mate Mikey. Before setting off we were asked if we wanted a drink to which we were supplied with two beers, free of charge...every drink was available whenever you wanted and was included in the price. The start of the trip consisted of a small journey out of the harbour and around the island. We were then supplied with our rods and bait and waited for the boat the drop it’s anchor before fishing out in the sea. Because of the knowledge of the waters, everyone on board caught a ton of fish which we all had photos with! After a few hours of sun, sea, fishing and beer, we were then allowed to swim in the sea to cool down and if preferred we could’ve snorkelled (which we did!). However unknown to us whilst we were snorkelling and enjoying a mini adventure underwater, we were called back up onto the boat to eat not only what we had caught but a big fish supplied by the trip as well as a salad (and more beer) that had been prepared using the on board barbecue. The food was so amazing and as fresh as it can get. The trip was that good, me and my partner did it twice. A great day out for all types of holiday. Highly recommended and we will be back soon!"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z6833IRjoyceb,October 2017,5,Great fishing trip! ,"Since we went in the end of the season, we had the opportunity to go on the fishing trip alone as a couple.First, the captain navigated us to some places to take nice pictures of the old town of Rhodos. After the photo's we went further on the sea to fish.I'd never fished before, but the captain took the time to teach me how to fish.I really appreciated that!After fishing the captain prepared the fish we caught on the BBQ , and we went for a swim. The meal he cooked tasted excellent!We really enjoyed the trip and would definitely recommend it to friends! "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twist3d1,October 2017,5,Fishing Trip,"Great fishing, nice food and beautiful bay to swim. Small fish were annoying to catch. Got great beer to compensate that. 6/5"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robboh890,September 2017,5,super nice captain....great afternoon of fun fishing,small fish but funny....try to catch some whilst eating dinner in the bay.....was fun as people snorkeling could see fish being caught. great crew.
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlueeyedArarat,August 2017,5,Best day of our whole holiday,"Went on this fishing trip with my sons - 16, 14 and 8. This was a lovely quiet trip with just a small boat and a small group of people. Run by such friendly people. We had a great time fishing, had the chance to swim between stops and were served a great lunch with fresh fresh sea bream. Highly recommend this trip - you will find their stall on Mandrake Harbour at the end nearest the deer statues. "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louiseperk88,August 2017,5,Wow what an experience,Just a fantastic afternoon. Great fishing with plenty of support for those who are unsure. A lovely bit of snorkelling (equipment provided) and gorgeous freshly cooked fish all combines for an incredible holiday experience. If you are visiting Rhodes this is a must!
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annjo67,August 2017,5,Fantastic,"A wonderful tour, with great fishing and swimming. To top it all off a great lunch with grilled fish and greek sallad.The Captain is great! And so is the girls in the marina.Excellent service.We strongly recommend this "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teddywah,August 2017,5,The best family fun we had in Rhodes..........,"Travelling as a family, generally its difficult to find activities a couple and Girls would be happy to do. despite early reservations (would girls be ok with the fishing) we embarked on our trip and had a most wonderful experience.Captain Vassilli and his co pilot Mark were excellent and basically taught us all to fish, They showed great patience and skill with our 10 year old who initially found the sport alien, however she went on to catch 5 good fish...  and thoroughly enjoyed her day. to a man we all agreed this was a holiday highlight. Food was fabulous and included some of our catch... well done Makarounas Fishing Trip. Highly recommended."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salalarvajani,August 2017,5,The highlight of our vacation,"Don't be fooled by the fancy looking tourist trap fishing boats, this is perfect for anyone from singles to couples to families and groups of friends. The boat accommodates 10 persons and no prior fishing experience is required. After a couple of hours of fishing we stopped for some snorkeling (bring your own for even better experience!) and after that we had the most delightful lunch. The captain prepared us the lunch that included the best greek salad and we got to eat the fish we caught! The whole experience costs around 100 euros for two adults and we spent well over 5 hours at the sea (your mileage may vary!) So it was a bargain. Hands down the highlight of our trip to Rhodes."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stewarte_11,August 2017,5,Daughters fishing adventure,My Daughter Emma and I went on this fantastic trip on Sunday 6th August.We left Harbour at 10.30 .After a cruise along the coast we then fished.It was fun Fishing on the Drift with small baits close to the bottom . The tackle was a little worn but I was impressed they used Braid . It was ok tackle for the size of fish we were catching. Emma and I both caught three fish and had plenty of bites.After 2hrs 30 minutes fishing we went close to the shore were we swam and snorkelled . The water was crystal clear and refreshing.Once back on board after photo`s had a fantastic meal of fish and salad . We were looked after very well by the captain and his two mates who were friendly and helpful .In all a very good fun trip well worth the money
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weysprings,July 2017,5,Brilliant day out,My family of four took the boot trip in the afternoon and we had a wonderful time. We went round the habour for soem nice views and then settled down for some fishing. Altogther we caught 20 or so fish and then went for a swim off the boat while the crew of 3 cooked us a meal of sea bream caught further out plus our fish. The crew looked after us very well. Its a great way to spend a few hours away from the rush and bustle of Rhodes.

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/296juhap,July 2017,5,Superb!,"Absolutely great. Also for children, 9 and 11 yrs. Great food and fun fishing.Went by morning so it was not as hot as afternoon."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tinkledivories,July 2017,5,"Fantastic, fabulous fun ","We walked along Mandraki harbour with an open mind about what sort of trip me might like to do whilst staying in Rhodes.The lady on the kiosk (Joanna I think her name was) was not at all pushy, yet she sold the trip to us really well. There are 2 trips a day- one leaving at 9am and the other leaving around 1.30pm. We opted for the earlier one, simply as we felt it might be too hot later in the day. It was €100 for the 2 of us, and like the previous reviewer mentioned, we did wonder whether it would be good value for money. When we first got onto the boat, the captain made us all drinks. Some has Greek coffee, others went for the cold beer - well, we are on holiday! We ventured out of the harbour, allowing time for photo opportunities - nice shots of the palace and castle walls and where Colossus stood. Then off we went along the coastline. We then anchored up and all given a fishing rod and showed what to do. There were 10 of us on the boat (I am told this is the maximum) and it was such fun. The boys got very competitive and the captain (Vaselis I think his name was), showed us beginners how to recognise a pull on the line and what was a poisonous fish. I managed to catch a puffer fish and although Had to be thrown back in the sea, was the highlight of my day! The captain and his helper were amazingly patient, humorous and friendly. We went off to a quieter spot by the beach for a swim whilst he cooked the fish. We were all served up an amazing piece of fish which the captain cooked over coals, plus he cooked the fish we had caught ourselves and gave to us with Greek salad and garlic bread. More drinks were offered (us girls had a glass of wine) and then some delicious watermelon. An absolutely amazing 4 hours. We would highly recommend to everyone and do it again. Worth every penny and beats any of the others advertised along that strip as it's so completely different. What a lovely bunch of guys and lovely lady selling this trip. Thank you so much. "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U5573VMdavidd,June 2017,5,Fabulous day out,"My other half booked this for us and to be honest I was a bit sceptical before the outing. It cost €100 for both of us which seemed expensive to me for a 9am-1pm trip out. However, I think this could be the high light of our trip to Rhodes. The girl at the harbour was very friendly and chatted to the Mrs (even though she has already decided we were going). On the day of the trip, she remembered us and promised we would have a great time. Once on the boat the Captain welcomed us and him and his ships help, Mikey were both in good spirits. There were only 5 Guests on his boat for our trip but he didn't seemed bothered by this at all. We drove out the harbour and could take photos of some of the scenery. We fished for a few hours and although I doubt anyone will ever catch anything more than a few inches long, it was great fun. We were offered drinks (included in the price) and looked after by the 2 gents, explaining which fish had spines etc. After about 2 & half hours (which flew by) we went in closer to shore to swim in the calm sea. My Mrs got changed for this below deck, although this was not totally private, the other men on the boat were respectful and stayed away from where she was. If she had been bothered by this, she wouldn't have been comfortable doing it. While we were swimming the Captain prepared lunch for us, possibly the best fish we have eaten this holiday, and a Greek salad followed by melon. And of course, more beer. This was a really great day, I would recommend it to anyone. So much fun."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E1664FAjonm,June 2017,5,The ULTIMATE boat trip,"Recently went to Rhodes with my 11 year old daughter and booked this fishing trip. It was the best decision I made. The captain is one of the nicest blokes I've met. Showed patience when he taught my daughter to fish, cooked the BEST fresh fish I've ever tasted and stopped off by the beach whilst we all jumped in crystal clear (and warm) water. He even had a life jacket for my daughter as she was worried about jumping into the sea. The trip is roughly 3.5 to 4 hours long, and is excellent value for money. I had a couple of ice cold beers on board and my daughter had orangeade (drinks are provided) The captain was a superb host and knowledgeable beyond belief about fishing. When I go back to Rhodes, I'll book the trip again. We even had a picture with our captain at the end of the trip! "
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A3438MZanthonys,May 2017,5,Well worth it - don't hesitate,"Quality day out, even if you don't fish. A nice trip on the boat in the sun, fish if you want to and then choose to swim once anchored up. The best bit is the food served. Lot's of it and all fresh. I've never tasted fresh fish as good. Fully worth it."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SilverBackYork,May 2017,5,Boys Fishing Trip,"What a great trip. Wonderful value for money, great fun and the best cooked piece of fish all holiday. The Captain (Vasilis?) Is a great, friendly and knowledgeable guy. Loved it! Shaun, Mike and Colin."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callsoppp,May 2017,5,Rhodes Fishing Trip,"Cannot recommend this boat trip enough! It was one of the definite highlights of our holiday. Boat trip, fishing, snorkelling and great food! We had opportunities to see and take photos of Rhodes before going out to start fishing. The guys on the boat were fantastic, showed all the fishing newbies the ropes (including myself!) and we caught loads of fish. We spent 2.5 hours fishing but it just flew by. It was so much fun. We then went closer in to shore and had the opportunity to snorkel if we wanted. They were more than happy to provide floats if you weren't sure about being in the sea too. The captain then barbecued fish for us and the food was amazing (photo attached). Overall it was such a fantastic experience and worth every penny. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to do a boat trip in Rhodes!  "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A5873NHmichaela,May 2017,5,Excellent fishing trip for the whole family,"We enjoyed a 4 hour fishing trip combined with very tasty food and swimming. The captain is friendly, relaxed and good with kids. Try it - you will not regret."

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairelouisac,October 2016,5,best part of our holiday,"wow I was blown away by Makarounas fishing trip. Me and my partner are regular fishers so to fish on holiday was something we were looking forward to. There are lots of boats and trips in different price ranges to choose from, especially during the busy season. However Makarounas fishing trip was fantastic, by far the best experience of our holiday and if you are going to choose a boat while in Greece this is the one! The ride began with a beautiful sight seeing adventure then it was time to fish. Our captain let us fish different areas and taught us all about different types of fish and how the sea work. After a few hours of fishing we had the most beautiful BBQ on the boat. All the fish we had was freshly seasoned, grilled to perfection, and along with that came a beautiful salad and fresh baked bread. The food was full of flavour. The best meal I had all week. To end the trip a chance to go swimming in the beautiful sea. Overall the trip offered great fishing, beautiful food, hot and cold drinks, your choice of music, swimming in a warm sea. But most of all the atmosphere on the boat was relaxing fun and the captain could not have been more helpful and welcoming, he made you feel that we had been friends for years. If your looking for a boat trip this is the one. It truly was a perfect day for me and my partner and we walked away on such a high"
