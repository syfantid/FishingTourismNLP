Wonderful day at sea!,"We had the most amazing experience a week ago on this little fishing trawler!
We were welcomed by Antonia who is the very talented cook of the trip, who was also very informative re wildlife and fishing and beautiful Kefalonia.
The nets were hauled in along with plenty of fish and lobster for our delicious lunch!
Swimming off the boat in a tiny secluded bay whilst we waited for lunch to be cooked........We would say better than any restaurant fare, it was a true feast a la mer!
Then to set the 3km nets again for tomorrows carch before heading home.
Such a welcoming, relaxing, genuine and fascinating experience.....stuff of great memories...thankyou all for a super super day to remember!",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
