Awesome,"We've just had our 2nd day out on this trip and are so happy to say it was as good as the 1st time.
Fantastic hospitality, delicious food and beautiful scenery and swimming.
We love this boat and the people who run it. Totally recommend to people with young children as the time flies by and its a very relaxing day out.....we will be back!",Date of experience: May 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
