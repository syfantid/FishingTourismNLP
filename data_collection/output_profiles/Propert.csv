Beautiful Sunrise,Visited 05/10 whilst staying in Skala second of two visits and both were memorable and thoroughly enjoyable.Had the seafood platter which was truly excellent and tonight had the Seafood Linguine which was divine and Mushroom Risotto that was extremely tasty.White and red wines were some of the best we have had in Kefalonia.Just taken a stroll up to Metaxa up the road and writing this review already wanting to visit Sunrise again for amazing food and service.,Date of visit: October 2020,Sunrise Fish Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great addition to village,Visited on 26/09 for evening meal and recommend booking if you want a table on the terrace as it was very busy on our arrival.We had read the positive reviews prior to our holiday and were looking forwarding to trying it out.We were not disappointed and had the sea bass and Briam dishes as mains and they were freshly cooked and beautiful.The courgette fritters starter was also a simple dish made to taste something special.The house rose was smooth and Morris’s.This is a great addition to the village and a short stroll from Antonias or Sirines Apartments.We will be returning.,Date of visit: September 2020,Chefalonia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Fantastico !,We have visited Mangia several times now on our trips to Falmouth and always found the food and welcome to be consistent and excellent.The atmosphere is chilled out with a mixture of families and couples of all ages.It is always a difficult choice between pizza or pasta dishes as they are both fantastic in quality and taste.Seafood linguine was beautiful as was goats cheese pizza.Fully recommend and can’t wait to go back.,Date of visit: August 2020,Mangia,1,"Falmouth, United Kingdom"

Coffee €4,We have visited this bakery regularly over the last 6 years and the pastries and cakes are excellent.We were browsing the cakes as usual and got directed to sit outside where a waitress would take our order.There were a number of free tables and upon receiving the bill we found out that we were charged €4 each for Cappucinos which was a bit steep for the roadside setting.It was my fault for not checking the menu - buyer beware and all that. If we ever return I would probably take away as I left feeling a bit ripped off.,Date of visit: July 2019,Spathis Bakery,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Nice food - Dirty Apron,Ate here on 28/05 for an early lunch.Efficient service when we arrived and ordered.Food was very tasty and filling however a waitress bringing food to tables was wearing a filthy apron that looked like it had not been washed for weeks.Overshadowed what was otherwise a good experience.,Date of visit: May 2019,V Rev Vegan Diner,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Best day of holiday,Went on trip with Efi and Dimitrios on 31/08/18.It is a great way to see and swim in the secluded coves especially the one with the mud bath.You can watch the fish coming out of the nets as they are brought up from the sea bed and help empty them or just sit back and watch.Efi cooks the catch for the best meal you will ever taste.It’s an awesome day out and ideal way for children to learn about the sea.Would fully recommend to all.,Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Nice pizzeria,Visited on 20/10 Seated promptly and enjoyed fresh pizza made with quality ingredients.You can watch the chefs cooking The dough was excellent but the only let down was the toppings were a bit thin in places.Very busy with takeaways so expect a wait and service charge of 12.5 % added to all bills.,Date of visit: October 2018,Farina Pizzeria,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Nice enough,Visited on 18/10 for lunch.Was let down slightly by Peking pork being dry and cold rather than a stand out dish on previous visit.The veg Paella went down well.Another couple of niggles no drinks list other than wine and hot tap in the gents was loose and difficult to use.On the plus side the drinks turned out to be reasonably priced and the bitter especially nice.Would visit again if in the area.,Date of visit: October 2018,The Midland Tapas & Wine Bar,1,"Anglesey, United Kingdom"
Spot the dolphin,Enjoyed a family meal here on 09/07.

NYC pizza at the beach,We ate in and had take away on recent trip to Johns Pass area.Order at the counter service pick up a cold beer from the fridge and watch the food being prepared.There is s cold water fountain on the drinks machine you just need to ask for a cup when ordering.Lots of locals grabbing a slice to go on the way past.Will visit again next time we’re in the area and would recommend as the spicy chicken wings garlic knots and pizzas were very good.,Date of visit: July 2018,DeLosa's Pizza,1,"Madeira Beach, Florida"
Okay Thai meal,We ate as a family of four and agreed it was an okay meal but nothing outstanding about it. The beers we ordered were $4 a piece which made up for the lack of wow factor in the food.We looked at the wine menu and it was silly New York prices and did not see a single bottle on anyone’s table which says something - or maybe it’s the fact beer compliments the food more ? Seems family run with slow lacklustre service and 18% charge automatically added to our bill!,Date of visit: July 2018,Zoob Zib Thai Authentic Noodle Bar,1,"New York City, New York"
Pleasent enough,We ate as a family of four and the meal was pleasant enough. I had the snapper which was not quite as fresh tasting as I would have liked and was salty tasting but the griddled vegetable accompaniment was excellent.The calamari and buffalo mozzarella starters were nice enough.The wine list was extensive but expensive which put us on a back foot when ordering as we had the discussion of just staying on water but the house half price red at $44 was chosen and went down well.The service was tip top and just right.,Date of visit: July 2018,Il Punto,1,"New York City, New York"
Breakfast NYC style,Had a family breakfast 14/07 vegetable omelette with fried potatoes toast jam $9 and refillable coffee $3.

Different standards,We ate here on 03/07 as family of 4 using credit cards for 4 ‘free’ meals from Ocean Florida UK. It was a joke as the waiter tried his utmost to get us to order outside the choices provided on the deal as if on commission.The food was of poor quality dry pasta and very small portions compared to the meals coming out to neighbouring tables then had the cheek to try and charge us for one of the meals.Waiter said there was a chocolate sundae desert included then brought ice cream instead with no explanation.All added up to an unpleasant meal in an establishment that has double standards.We will not return to a Hard Rock Cafe as I can see through the falseness and it anything but rocks.,Date of visit: July 2018,Hard Rock Cafe,1,"Orlando, Florida"
Wood fired pizza,Visited 27/06 for lunch.Had two wood fired pizzas glass of Shiraz and can Pelligrino for £20 Very tasty and good value.Staff were efficient especially young waiter who cleared and cleaned our table.Chilli Oil was a nice touch.I would recommend a visit.,Date of visit: June 2018,Hangin' Pizzeria,1,"Betws-y-Coed, United Kingdom"
Not impressed,Take away fish chips & peas 27/06 fish was over cooked and lacked taste as did the chips and peas.I ended up throwing half of it away and will not be visiting again and at £7.90 was not a cheap meal.,Date of visit: June 2018,Harbour View Cafe,1,"Deganwy, United Kingdom"
Par excellence,Visited on 08/06 and enjoyed an excellent meal and service.The crab and shrimp starter followed by sirloin steak was a meal to remember with a moreish rose to compliment the food.The Turkish delight ice cream worked really well.Would not hesitate to recommend.,Date of visit: June 2018,Paysanne,1,"Deganwy, United Kingdom"

Touch of class,Visited on 24/05 and just had drinks but the food looked very appealing.Had a nice buzzing atmosphere and staff were friendly and efficient.It is tucked away just off the main road through Menai Bridge and well worth seeking out for the fantastic views and ambience.We will be back to sample the menu.,Date of visit: May 2018,Dylan's,1,"Anglesey, United Kingdom"
Distinctly average,Was looking forward to my planned visit having read rave reviews.Paid entrance fee £7.50 each and straight to cafe for lunch.Soup and a sandwich “deal” £9.40 - the vegetable lacked taste and the bread in the sandwich was slightly stale as if it had been frozen then defrosted.The gardens were like a miniature Bodnant Gardens and a pleasant way to spend an hour but I left with an unpleasant taste in my mouth - literally.,Date of experience: May 2018,Plas Cadnant Hidden Gardens,1,"Anglesey, United Kingdom"
Lovely cakes & coffee,Popped in for a cappuccino and snicker cake .Gorgeous. I usually have the coffee cake that tastes like tiramisu.Give it a try and you will be like me thinking why did i go past without trying it sooner.,Date of visit: May 2018,Monia's Cakes,1,"Warrington, United Kingdom"
Top Notch,Had an early evening Friday meal and really enjoyed it.

Can’t wait to go back and have same again.,Date of visit: December 2017,Northern Soul Grilled Cheese,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Mediocre meal,Ate here on 21/10 and the meal did not live up to expectation.We had the scallops which were two small frozen not fresh specimens for nearly £10! All other dishes were distinctly average and we would not return.12.5 % service charge added to bill is a bit cheeky for this level of service.,Date of visit: October 2017,POLPO Covent Garden,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Cheap and cheerful,Had a lunch here on 21/10 and it was enjoyed by all.Tasty Thai street food.Eat as much as you want for £8.95 and £3 for a beer.The food was fresh varied in spice and was replenished regularly.Would recommend if you are in Portobello Road area and want to get off your feet for lunch rather than eating on the move.Toilet was clean.Only takes cash but Sainsbury’s across road has free cash machine.

Amazing,"My daughter told me to book the trip as it looked really interesting to me spending a day on a working fishing boat & so glad we did it.We had the most amazing day with our hosts and our fellow passengers newlyweds Piotr and Malwina from Poland and Danielle from Blackpool who were great company.Emptying the nets, snorkelling in secluded bays, eating fresh snapper and lobster and drinking a few cheeky glasses of wine and plenty of laughs.An awesome day we will never forget.Thank you for your hospitality.",Date of experience: July 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Perfectly fine,We visited as a couple on a short break.Half the price of other hotels and half the space in the room but spent most of time sightseeing so no problem.Reception very efficient and helpful and breakfast continental at good price for the quality and choice.All in all we enjoyed our stay and would recommend.,Date of stay: May 2017,Cabinn City Hotel,1,"Copenhagen, Denmark"

Recommended for an evening.,Date of experience: May 2017,Tivoli Gardens,1,"Copenhagen, Denmark"
Service charge,We visited on 07/05/17 and would say the food was good albeit the portion sizes were small for the price paid.

Disorganised,Visited 03/11 and left feeling like we will not be returning for a while until the place gets its act together.Waited for 40 mins for our drinks to arrive .The food was okay but nothing special.We have been visiting this place for 16 years + during which time have found it to be generally very good but there seemed something lacking in service and value on our last couple of visits so will be going elsewhere in the future,Date of visit: November 2016,The Stretton Fox,1,"Stretton, United Kingdom"

Historically significant,I have read some of the reviews and I feel some people missed the point of this place being more concerned about the cloakroom or the cafe.We found it fascinating and finished off in a lovely cafe at the back of the courtyard inside the art gallery where we had coffees and a spicy vodka.Well worth a visit.,Date of experience: October 2016,"Muzeum Krakowa, oddział Fabryka Emalia Oskara Schindlera",1,"Krakow, Poland"
