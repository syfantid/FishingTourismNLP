Really fun & brilliant company,"Everything was run really professionally. The team were great, friendly and good fun. I was travelling solo so went in the kayak with Maria (the owner of the company) who was great and did most of the hard work out of the 2 of us. They gave us lots of good guidance and let us see things you’d never see doing it yourself. The other guide George was taking lots of photos and getting everyone wet. We did a bit of swimming and snorkelling as well. The lunch was really simple but tasty. They all brought us a beer at the end which was a nice touch. Definitely recommend and advise to contact them directly rather than booking through Tripadvisor as they are really quick to respond and super helpful.",,Rhodes Sea Kayaking Tour,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great day out and really good company,Really well run trip. I drove all day as the lady who travelled in my jimny didn’t want to drive. Cars are well maintained and no one had any problems. They take across challenging terrain but nothing too difficult and gave you guidance all the time to ensure you stay safe and most importantly not to crash or break the car. Very relaxed company and was a great trip overall. Caroline (the owner & guide) spoke quite a 5 or so languages fluently so no problem so able to communicate really well with everyone. I wanted to do more tours for Rhodes Adventures but unfortunately didn’t stay long enough to be able to book more. Will definitely use them again next time I come to Rodos.,,Half-Day Island of Rhodes Jeep Driving Safari with Pickup,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
A must do!,"Really great trip. The crew were great, friendly and helpful. Don’t expect to catch big fish to eat but it was really good fun and great value for money. The lunch was simple but so tasty (fresh grilled fish, Greek salad & grilled bread). All the drinks were included (ice cold local beer). Stopped off for a swim in a really cool cove. Thoroughly recommend!",Date of experience: September 2020,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"

2 days in Roma,"Amazing location, it’s like being a central hub to all the hot spots so you could pop back and freshen up on your way past. Rooms were great, good facilities and very luxurious. The manager was really nice and relaxed which was great. The road it’s on is very noisy so that could a problem if you want peace and quiet but unfortunately if you want the location then you have to work around the noise. We didn’t have ear plugs and slept from midnight to 7am no problem. It’s a shared building with a security guard (or locked if he is away) so very secure as well. Definitely recommend!",Date of stay: September 2018,Le Quattro Dame,4,"Rome, Italy"
"Left hungry, it’s over priced and the manager is rude.","It felt like self service. Waited 40 minutes for the drinks to come after several prompts. After an hour of being there nobody had taken our food order so again had to go and find someone. We decided to go straight to the bar for another round rather than waiting. The barman (which later transpired was the manager) was generally just rude and obnoxious. Had to chase up cutlery, plates and glasses for water. All in all the service was terrible. For food we ordered the two person sharing platter for £16. We got 2 x tiny satay skewers, breaded prawn, veg spring roll and Thai sweet corn thing, pretty pathetic considering the cost. The main was ok but I’ve eaten better Thai and the prices are far to high for “tapas” portions. Needless to say I won’t be going back.",Date of visit: August 2018,"Mango Thai Tapas, Ocean Village",4,"Southampton, United Kingdom"
Good and reliable,"Easy booking process, good value, Drivers were on time both ways. Couldn’t ask for anything more. Definitely recommend.",Date of experience: November 2017,Suntransfers,4,"Barcelona, Spain"
Atlas Mountains and Berber Villages Day,"We had a “lovely jubbly” day out in the Atlas Mountains. It was nice getting out of the city and seeing Morocco in a different light was really interesting. We were picked up by Omar, who was really happy, good fun and most importantly a very good driver. We then picked up Issmail our guide who was great. He was really informative, helpful and also very good fun. We saw some great sights and the “trekking” was actually a lot more strenuous than I thought it was going to be. We finished the day at a family home for lunch. They prepared a salad and a really tasty tagine. Was a really great tour and would definitely recommend. Thank you Issmail and Omar!",Date of experience: November 2017,Day Trips From Marrakech,4,"Marrakech, Morocco"
Sunset Safari,"I called up Trail Detours very last minute as I was planning to propose to my fiancé because my original plans had been scuppered! Luckily for me Wayne's afternoon tour had to cut their tour short because their ship was leaving earlier than planned so manage to fit us in and put a brilliant tour together.

Wayne picked us up from the Old Town in a pristine 1980's Jeep and headed off to some really private and amazing vantage points all around the island you would never ever find on your own. Some of the roads were pretty hairy but with the Jeep it was no trouble and surprisingly pretty comfy! As the sunset was approaching fast we bombed our way to a secluded bay. Wayne gave us a picnic blanket, showed us the way, said take all the time we needed and left us to it. The bay was perfect and as the sun was setting I popped the question (she said yes of course). After spending some time there and taking too many photos for my liking we headed back to the Jeep and off to the restaurant.

Unfortunately because of the last minute nature we couldn't go to Amor Castle. However he took us to a really lovely traditional family run Konoba which had a few tables on a small jetty overlooking the water. The food there was amazing, and I think everything that could be grown, homemade or caught there was. We also had a couple of drinks which were included in the package and Wayne also brought us a bottle of sparkling wine which was a really nice touch. We actually found out after the meal Wayne used to be a chef and trained with some of the best chefs in the UK. So there's comfort in knowing he will only take you places where he likes to eat.

All in all I really couldn't have asked for a more perfect setting for popping the question and my new fiancé was over the moon with everything. I got a lot of kudos from friends and family however it's all really thanks to Wayne!
I would 100% recommend doing the Sunset Tour even just for a nice romantic evening or any tour with Trail Detours for that matter! It's really not your average tour!",Date of experience: July 2017,Trail Detours,4,"Korcula Island, Croatia"
How have I not been before,"I have been coming to Bansko for 5 years and never stopped here. Glad we made the stop this year. Delicious food and very reasonable. Traditional and appears to be independently run. We had meatballs (burger), chicken chop (flat chicken breast), cheesy chips and milk salad ( tzatziki). Was around 22 lev. Beers are around 3 lev. Definitely stop and don't ski past!",Date of visit: March 2017,Peshterite,4,"Bansko, Bulgaria"
"Good food, atmosphere and great staff",We had the Guinness pie (special of the day) washed down with a Guinness (or 3) and shared a tiramisu (amazing!). Great atmosphere and live music. Added bonus of a free ride home by the owner. Would definitely recommend!,Date of visit: March 2017,The Irish Harp,4,"Bansko, Bulgaria"
"Food was good, service was below average","We had the shopska salad and homemade bread muffin (a must have) to start. For main we shared the pork knuckle. The knuckle was one of the best I had here and the accompaniments were ok (fresh home cooked chips and shredded cabbage). I prefer the knuckle with the skillet cooked vegetables and rich gravy personally. Service was inattentive, slow and curt (not bad just could be better). I think they are geared more for large group rather than couples so probably focus their efforts on them. I would have score it 3.5 but rounded up.",Date of visit: March 2017,Baryakova Tavern,4,"Bansko, Bulgaria"
Still good but has been better,"We come here every year for the classic skewer. It normally comes with crispy fries, shredded cabbage, tomatoes and cucumber. This year the skewer was smaller, the fries were limp and not many of them (although fresh home cooked this year) and no tomatoes or cucumber. Still very tasty however. Service was ok. Would have scored it 3.5 but rounded up as they are normally very good.",Date of visit: March 2017,The LOG House,4,"Bansko, Bulgaria"
Curry night... Curry coma!!,"We come here every year (5th time) and it keeps getting better and better. James the owner and chef keeps adding and improving the curries every year! Really nice evening, very sociable and being a couple it's nice to sit with other people. My personal curry favourites were the Kashmiri pork and the Afghan chicken but there's curries for all tastes. Make sure you are very hungry, wearing comfy clothes and prepared walk of your dinner as you will be in a Curry coma by the time you leave! I don't really want to leave a good review as I might struggle getting a table next year but it is great!",Date of visit: March 2017,The Avalon,4,"Bansko, Bulgaria"
"Huge steak, great value and service","3rd time here and I still really love the steaks. Not sure what cut it is but it's very succulent and lean (oh and huge). I had the steak Diana and my partner had the Mexico steak. I recommend both but the accompanying sauces were better last year in my opinion. One of our steaks came out cold and slightly undercooked to the preference. The waiter (could be the owner) dealt with it very well and rectified it quickly. He also brought out a berry cheesecake as an apology which was very kind and most importantly, amazing! I don't really think Bansko do desserts but would definitely come back for just for that!",Date of visit: March 2017,Steak House Lazur,4,"Bansko, Bulgaria"
Felt really authentic Indian food and so tasty,I've never been to India but I work with a lot of Indians and trying their home cooked food I feel this is one of the most authentically cooked Indian restaurants I've been to. It also sourced lots of local food and had a good fusion twist between Scotland and India. The food wasn't drowned in fat and everything was full of flavour. High recommend!,Date of visit: September 2016,Tabla Authentic Indian Restaurant,4,"Perth, United Kingdom"
"Good food, could focus more on their service","The food they served me was really good and I have no problem with the quality of it (I had fillet steak with Jacket potatoes and the standard trimmings). However the food was sort of dumped on my table as the waitress walked past with other food orders to serve. I then spent the next 10 minutes trying to get the attention of a member of staff as they are running around the restaurant for butter, mustard and a drink to go with my meal which was annoying. I think if they focused as much on service as the quality of my meal it would be a really great place.",Date of visit: September 2016,Paco's Restaurant,4,"Perth, United Kingdom"
