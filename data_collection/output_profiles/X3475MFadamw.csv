Great holiday but a couple of downsides,"We had a great holiday today is our last full day and I want to say how friendly all the park staff are and how clean the caravan was. The pub was very nice and staff were friendly and the chip shop was very nice and again the young chap was polite and friendly.

The couple of downsides were the bathroom in the van doesn’t have a lock , the wi fi that you have to pay for is not worth it has it keeps losing connection so I would advise anyone not to bother. The job on the cooker doesn’t spark we had to go get matches to light it from the shop.

Thank you for a nice holiday.",Date of stay: September 2018,Kessinglnd beach caravan with sea views,4,"Kessingland, United Kingdom"

Brilliant staff and great sites,"Me and my wife are on honeymoon and she went mad the moment she saw the boat had characters from the little mermaid we got chatting to the man in front of it and decided to give it a go.

What a great decision we saw some wonderful views of the harbour and got to see lots of fish being fed and a lobster ! The diver feeding the fish was brilliant and made the whole boat smile if you get the chance I recommend this is goes to the top of your list.",Date of experience: May 2018,Poseidon Submarine,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
