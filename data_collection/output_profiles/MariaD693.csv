Recommended and not disappointed!,"After popping in the Hipsta shop nearby we went on their recommendation and it wasn’t wrong. We had two started, two mains and a bottle of wine and the value was amazing. The food was delicious with great flavour and just the right amount of heat. The young man that served us was excellent at his job and although the restaurant was busy due to a large party the service we received wasn’t compromised. When we return to Paraparaumu we will defo eat here again! Thank you",Date of visit: July 2020,Thai Marina,4,"Paraparaumu, New Zealand"
A gem next to the train station,"We were staying at the Premier Inn opposite Exeter St David’s and saw Karma when we arrived. Looking at previous reviews we decided to try it and were glad we did.

On arrival (we were early) there was a slight delay as the manager ensured we had a table by the window rather than the wall.

We had poppadoms while we made our choice but my favourite lime pickle wasn’t provided - one quick mention and I soon had the “one that makes my mouth hurt”!

The menu has some dishes you would see in many Indian restaurants but it certainly doesn’t have the same old categories of your standard Indian, in fact it didn’t have our goto starter of prawn puri which forced me to try something new - the lamb chops Lucknowi were delicious! The Goan fish curry and chicken jalfrezi were enjoyed, the portions weren’t off puttingly huge and we enjoyed desserts of gulab jamun and also the pistachio Kulfi.

This restaurant has only been open 10 months and through word of mouth is obviously doing well and deserves to. The customer service was faultless by both the manager and waitress. There was a laid back feel and the staff were happy to chat but not intrude. Lovely evening.",Date of visit: July 2019,Karma,4,"Exeter, United Kingdom"
Great apartment and lovely people,"We stayed for a week and couldn’t fault it. Polymnia & Dimitri were so welcoming and always on hand to give advice along with eggs, home grown plums and homemade marmalade!
The apartment had everything we needed including an umbrella to take to the beach. All clean with towels changed twice a week and sheets once.
The garden is amazing with so many areas to sit and relax in and a massive BBQ to use.
The little secluded beach within walking distance (although steep) was a must for us every morning.
We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to others and really hope to get back there soon. Thank you for a lovely stay ️",Date of stay: June 2019,Polymnia Apartments,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
We couldn’t stop going back!,"We visited this taverna on our first night and we were there nearly every day there after! We did try the one down the road but the view was the only reason and not enough to stop us visiting Isalos again.
All the food we had was delicious; the moussaka, swordfish, kleftiko, veal stifado, shrimp saganaki, pork souvlaki, meat pie etc etc. On our first night we thought a main on the specials was a starter and they were more than happy for us to share it as a starter... nothing was too much trouble.
We never felt rushed or given the hard sell for more drinks or desserts, in fact I only managed to try the baklava on our last night because of being so full on every other night but determined to have some before our departure!
The staff and owners are so lovely and so welcoming, we were just so sad to be leaving. Don’t forget to ask about the family fishing boat trips (another aspect that is not given the hard sell).
Thank you so much Danae and family, we thoroughly enjoyed your hospitality and delicious food (especially the zucchini balls and ouzo & lemon Fanta!). I will have to come up with something exceptional tonight for tea!",Date of visit: June 2019,Isalos Spartia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
If you do nothing else in Kefalonia go on this trip!,"Probably the best organised trip I have ever done on any holiday! I felt like they shared a secret bit of Kefalonia with us. The hosting was great, the food superb and to see how proper fisherman fish was fantastic. All in all a magical day and we will be recommending it to everyone. Thank you Antonia, Nikki and family xx (and the lobster was to die for)",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Would definitely return,"We stayed here because of its proximity to Skomer as we were visiting the following day. We arrived late due to hideous traffic on the M4 but found a note left telling us which pitch and to visit reception in the morning. Unfortunately we were leaving early to get the boat but sent a text to the emergency number to suss our options for paying. They were so laid back and relaxed about it all and were happy for us to pop in after our day out. Lovely to encounter such trust in this day and age. The toilets and showers could do with modernising but from other reviews that’s likely to happen in the near future. They were, however spotless and I made use of the shower/toilet off the washing up room which had a handy heater as well. Thank you for being so helpful, we’ll be visiting again!",Date of stay: May 2018,Redlands Touring Caravan & Camping Park,4,"Hasguard Cross, United Kingdom"
Loved our one night,"The site is lovely. Small and perfectly formed. We had the biggest pitch for our 5m motorhome and it was perfect. The toilets and showers were spotless and although we didn’t use it there was fridge and freezer space available for each pitch. Nia was super friendly and helpful and it was lovely bumping into her down the Griffin that evening, where we enjoyed a lovely meal. It’s a very short walk into Dale but the pub is busy so best to reserve a table. You need to book ahead for this campsite as pitch numbers are limited and it is a little gem. Just wish we’d been able to stay longer!",Date of stay: May 2018,Point Farm Campsite,4,"Dale, United Kingdom"
Very friendly service,"We eat here regularly taking advantage of the vouchers found on the internet which offer great value. The food is always good. This time we were served by Kellie who was super efficient and very friendly. We have found on recent visits that the wait for food and drinks can be longer than ideal but this is no reflection of the waiting staff. A drink after our meal hadn’t arrived by the time we asked for the bill and Kellie ensured that this wasn’t included. She really made our visit enjoyable, thank you.",Date of visit: May 2018,The Pavillion Beefeater Restaurant,4,"Weston super Mare, United Kingdom"
Loooking at booking again already!,"We were a bit worried ahead of arriving due to all the double booking talk on previous reviews but emailed the hotel ahead and our booking was confirmed. I don't know how the problems occurred but I really don't think it's a money making scheme by Yannis because we booked back in January and only paid £82 for the week!
The hotel was great and Yannis, Nikos and all the staff were really really friendly and made our holiday even better.
The facilities at Piskopiano Village were good and better than any other Greek resort I've stayed in before. Both pools were nice and our apartment was located very close to the bottom pool which was handy.
The location of Piskopiano above Hersonissos is very convenient (if you want to visit, which we weren't keen to - 10 mins and the hill back up isn't that bad) and there are plenty of tavernas, restaurants and bars available in Old Hersonissos, Piskopiano and Koutouloufari if you aren't twenty two and don't want to dance on tables! Our favourite was Galini's in Koutouloufari but David's in Piskopiano was great and offered really authentic Greek food for very low prices. We also enjoyed Mezes in Koutouloufari and during the whole holiday we didn't have a bad meal.
Driving in Crete is an experience and I would definitely advise that you learn to use the hard shoulder to allow other cars to pass! We booked our hire car before we went and looking at prices around locally it is probably the cheaper way to do it.
During our stay we made the effort to go to Ballos beach (lagoon) in the north west of the island. It was about a 3 hour drive but definitely worth it.. The new main road takes you most of the way but the last 6km is on a very very bumpy dirt track which really is suitable for 4x4s. We got there in our little Hyundai Getz but I wouldn't recommend it! Once there though the lagoon is fantastic and the most beautiful beach I've ever visited (better than Olu Deniz in Turkey). The walk up and down takes a bit of effort but don't let it put you off and the taverna at the top opens after 2pm so make sure you take drinks etc if you arrive before.
A brilliant holiday had by all and we will definitely look at returning!",Date of stay: August 2011,Piskopiano Village Apartments,4,"Crete, Greece"
