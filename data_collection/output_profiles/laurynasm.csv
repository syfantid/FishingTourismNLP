Fantastic captain and a nice trip!,"We had a fantastic day on a boat with Tasos! Swimming, fishing, stopping at several islands and having a lot of fun. Boat is not luxurious, but if fantastic captain and atmosphere, fresh fish dishes for lunch, also attention to customer is your priority - this is the best choice in Poros!!!

P.s. ask Tasos to show some jokes on his phone :)",,Fun holiday in the blue waters of the Saronic Gulf!,1,"Poros, Greece"
Cheating with water,"This restaurant place a water on tables with no price tag. If you or your kids will open it - 3.9 euro.
We were robbed almost 12 euros for still water...
In addition food was not as expected at all.",Date of visit: November 2017,Gan Bei City,1,"Vilnius, Lithuania"
Outstanding experience,"I have to start that i live in Klaipėda, but never went there because of fair to get big bill.
Last month we go there for business dinner. So my fear came true, but everything we saw and eat here was so worth it! It is outstanding interior with great service and food. I am looking forward for the next time in Meridianas!
Must visit for tourists visiting Klaipėda!",Date of visit: February 2016,Restoranas Meridianas,1,"Klaipeda, Lithuania"
Very nice course,"We were very happy to play this course. Personel was great. Everyone from the guy doing transfer, to the ones in reception. And the course was of better condition than we expected it to be in the dessert! Of course due to climate everything is very fast. Greens, fairways. The nice surprise was that front nines even have water - some lakes connected by running rivers and bridges. Well - really amazing thing when you think where you are!
After finish the play they meet you with cold karkade tea and wet towels!
I dont think that was our last visit here. Read sea, nice makadi hotels, great climate and golf - everything for fair price. Recomended.",Date of experience: January 2016,Madinat Makadi Golf,1,"Hurghada, Egypt"

Dry and strange taste steak,"Just left this place with worst memories. I chosen a fillet steak for 470 nok with a wish to gear great meal. Instead i got a dry peace of meat that could hardly compete with an average quality beef meal in bad restaurant. Nothing even similar to fillet!!! Waiter after getting my complain, stopped understanding english and did not want to hear anything. In my country i would have refused to pay for such meal. If you only have a possibility, avoid this place. Especially if you understand something about how steak should taste like.",Date of visit: March 2015,Big Horn Steak House Kongsberg,1,"Kongsberg, Norway"
not worth the money,"We visited the zoo end October, and were very disappointed. really. if the ticket price was 60 DKK instead of 160, and if that was the first zoo to visit in your life, then it would be adequate. Now, the price is same as LORO park in Tenerife, but here you get 5 times less!!! For example zoo in Riga (Latvia) is much much cleaner, no such bad smell, almost same animals, for me it seems better value - and price is 6 euro. Frankly speaking, we felt like we just threw the money out in the wind.",Date of experience: October 2014,Copenhagen ZOO,1,"Frederiksberg, Denmark"
great place. a must visit,"Great place. nice to be there in day time and till it gets dark. if you have kids that like adventure park - this is a must place to visit. we bought 300 DKK ticket that gives you access to it all. and we spend a wonderful 6 hours there. My daughter compared it to Disney Land in Paris. But this one is much more compact in terms of space, which gives it cosines. And all style is very different. I believe many people may like Tivoli even better than Disneyland. This visit was a compensation to us after visiting the overpriced bad smelling Copenhagen zoo :)",Date of experience: October 2014,Tivoli Gardens,1,"Copenhagen, Denmark"
