Decent room for the area,Very nice and clean common areas. Our room was slightly above average by my standards but very nice for this area. I felt more comfortable here than another hotel we stayed at the first night. Our biggest complaint was the dampness of the room caused our sheets to feel wet; it felt a gross trying to fall asleep. Was surprised to find fecal marks in toilet upon arrival. But clean otherwise.,Date of stay: July 2018,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Port Clinton,3,"Port Clinton, Ohio"
Amazing!,"I have always been afraid of heights but decided to give this a shot based on the reviews. Tan is didn’t disappoint! He was fabulous and made me feel comfortable. It was a great experience. Unfortunately due to weather issues, the rest of my family weren’t able to paraglide. I very much appreciated his consciousness.",Date of experience: June 2018,Cretan Paragliding,3,"Crete, Greece"
Highlight of our time in Milos,"Warning: do NOT eat before going on this tour! You will eat many delicious meals on this trip. The hosts went above and beyond to make you comfortable and had everything you need - water, soda food etc. I would highly recommend!",Date of experience: June 2018,Milos Fishing Experience,3,"Milos, Greece"
