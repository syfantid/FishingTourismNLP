Excellent flavors and superb staff,We had chef's menu and it was excellent in variety and the flavors were amazing. We really liked the fusion of Peruvian and Japanese kitchens as most of the ingredients were familiar to us but mixed in a fresh and tasty way. The staff was superb from the moment we stepped in the restaurant to the minute we left. It is really hard to find this friendly and personal service in Helsinki.,Date of visit: September 2017,Pastor Restaurant,4,"Helsinki, Finland"
The highlight of our vacation,"Don't be fooled by the fancy looking tourist trap fishing boats, this is perfect for anyone from singles to couples to families and groups of friends. The boat accommodates 10 persons and no prior fishing experience is required. After a couple of hours of fishing we stopped for some snorkeling (bring your own for even better experience!) and after that we had the most delightful lunch. The captain prepared us the lunch that included the best greek salad and we got to eat the fish we caught! The whole experience costs around 100 euros for two adults and we spent well over 5 hours at the sea (your mileage may vary!) So it was a bargain. Hands down the highlight of our trip to Rhodes.",Date of experience: August 2017,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great people and ok food,We met our family here on a busy weekend and it was clear that our orders were mixed with other tables. One of our party had to wait her main course for over 10 minutes longer than the rest. The people are great as it is common over here. Saganaki was ok but the garlic prawns were a little bland. There are so many great restaurants around that I'm not sure we'll come back.,Date of visit: August 2017,Mama Sofia's,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Quantity over quality with slow service,We went here twice on our trip to Rhodes for lynch and for dinner. Lunch experience was ok with ok Caesar salad and beer combo. The salad was huge and tasted good so no complains about that. The check took around 20 minutes and two requests. For our dinner we had Gyros plates. Bad choice. The meat was thick and bland and it was served with fries. Pretty much the only thing that was good was the Tzatziki. As usual the check took two tries ans over 10 minutes. Why bother going here when you can have great quality food for the same money with better service?,Date of visit: August 2017,Arena Sports Bar & Grill,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Can't beat this place,We first went here with our family and after the main course it was clear that we have to make a reservation for anorher day as well. The staff is the friendliest and the most genuine there is. But of course when visiting a restaurant the food is the most important thing. If you want to eat the best dish on the island have Seared tuna. It is literally the best dish we had and is in the top 5 list of my personal all time favorites. If you don't have a reservation be sure to be early as this place is packed (unlike it's neighbor) after 20.30 hrs. Highly recommend!,Date of visit: August 2017,Nireas,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Drinks among friends,"You always feel welcomed here. The staff is super friendly and nice. The drinks are affordable and the local beer is served ice cold - literally! You never run out of complimentary chips, popcorn or peanuts. Our choice for a pint or two before the dinner.",Date of experience: August 2017,Johnny's Pub,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Smaller than we ecpected,For a 12â‚¬ attraction this place was a disappointment compared to other museums and historical sites around the world. Hordes of clueless people were blocking narrow stairs and paths all the time and the site itself is quite small. Basic knowledge of history and photos from outside is enough if you are running out of time. The climbing is not that bad or hard. But the path is not marked so follow the other people or ask the locals.,Date of experience: August 2017,Acropolis of Lindos,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Friendly and tasty,"We had very good time here, tasty food and friendly service. The place got crowded at 3PM, so be sure to make your reservation 14.30 or 14.45 to get your food faster. Rabbit pie, salmon, veal tartar and blinis were all right on target. Highly recommend this awesome restaurant.",Date of visit: July 2017,Restoran Moon,4,"Tallinn, Estonia"
"Food is good, service is slow","We went here looking for excellent food and service based on Tripadvisor reviews. We got good food slowly. Service was indeed super slow to the point we had to run to our ferry after spending over 1,5 hours for only main course. The server was friendly and nice alright, but we prefer speed. At least when we don't have too much time to spend.",Date of visit: August 2016,Rataskaevu16,4,"Tallinn, Estonia"
Can't beat the appetizers,"The appetizers here are the best, the service is fast and very friendly. We find this restaurant the best in the Rataskaevu street. Very good!",Date of visit: August 2016,Von Krahli Aed,4,"Tallinn, Estonia"
