Best trip ever!!,"Best boat trip we’ve had! Doesn’t matter if only one of you like fishing there is enough to do for everyone! If your not experienced Dimitri is on hand to help! We stopped off for swimming, snorkelling, went to a cave, Dimitri cooked lunch with what had been caught and we had an amazing fruit salad in the afternoon! Tunes were on all day, really friendly boat, we were friends with everyone by the end of the day! Find him by his boat on the new port or at Meltemi coffee shop opposite his boat! Amazing value for money!",Date of experience: September 2018,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
