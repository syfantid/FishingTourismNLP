Never been here before and,"Never been here before and decided to pop in for a drink, walked around the back and saw people drinking on the balcony and found a table and sat down. Within seconds one of the staff said the balcony was closing and we to sit downstairs. We ordered coffees inside at the bar and was told we had to wait for them, there were no details taken for Contact and Trace and there was no PPE. My friend paid contactless and brought the drinks out himself. Just as we started to drink the coffees one of the staff cane out to say we hadnt paid - my friend said he had and heard it ping on the pdq and said please check and if it hasnt gone through he was happy to pay. It started to rain so we decided to go in and sit on a table by the window - the same girl shouted from the behind the bar “you cant sit there it for food only - you need to sit over there by the wall” - there was only one couple on that area at the time. So we moved to the area we were asked. I went to ask for a menu to look at the food and asked if the payment had gone through- the same girl said yes it had and the receipt has fallen on the floor and she has not seen it - at no time did she apologise or explain to my friend who paid, if I had not have asked we would not have known that. A few minutes later the same girl came over and said “just to let you know this table has been booked in am hours time” we clearly thought that our custom was not needed and we left.",Date of visit: August 2020,The Boat That Rocks,1,"Isle of Portland, United Kingdom"
Excellent all round,"Booked a trip for the wife and I as an exclusive boat trip. From the phone messages booking, the actual trip, the bot pock and drop off were all excellent. The day was perfect. On the way we were lucky to have Dolphins swimming around. The captain gave us a running commentary, showing us the sites, booked us in for an quality lunch at a fish restaurant, plenty of swimming too. Can not recommend then enough. Thanks for making a great day and experience.",Date of experience: August 2020,Island Travel Brac,1,"Brac Island, Croatia"
Superb Food and Superb Service,"Let’s start at the beginning - our waiter Manuel (Argentinian) was excellent and very attentive through out. He was informative about the food and nothing was too much trouble.
My wife and I had the Beef Wellington - Simply superb and will be back for more.",Date of visit: August 2019,Empire Modern British Restaurant & Steak House,1,"Tenerife, Spain"
Fantastic,"My wife and I are foodies and eat seafood around the world - I have to say that is one of the best. The staff were fantastic - very attentive and full of knowledge on the plates they offered.

I would have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant to any one.

The head waiter knows his wine (I think his name was Martin) - he knows about the origins of every wine and recommend a local white from the north of Tenerife that was fantastic.

I fully recommend you to try.",Date of visit: August 2019,El Medano,1,"Tenerife, Spain"
What an amazing day !,"If you want to see a fisherman in his local environment - pulling in the nets in and allowing you - if you wish - to help take the fish out - then cooking them along with the most fantastic prawns then this is a must trip.

My wife and I joined another couple who had booked for the day - after a great traditional Greek breakfast we headed to the nets to see the catch, then on to a small beach for a spot of snorkelling and swimming while the hosts Maria and Captain Yannis prepared today’s catch - we then went to a small Island where we watched them cook the most fantastic fish stew and fried fish.

We learnt so much from Maria on Kefalonias traditions, and about the island. Yannis spoke enthusiastically and showed us how everything was done - so we can try and repeat the recipes in England.

After a great swim where Yannis joined us - we went back to Port completely satisfied on the whole day.

I can not recommend this enough.",Date of experience: August 2019,Poseidon Fishing Tourism Kefalonia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Top Draw,"This was my fourth visit to the Crab Cafe, living over 40 miles away to specifically take some friends who like us are seafoodys. What a treat they had for us today. Greeted well, the staff were excellent throughout. We were lucky that the sun was out so we eat outside. Fresh Oysters while we looked at the menu, then the starters.... Superb, followed by the main courses.... All fresh, tasty and well worth the money .... The staff were very efficient and added to the relaxed atmosphere. We left by booking again for six months time and drove back completely satisfied. Well done.",,Crab House Cafe,1,"Weymouth, United Kingdom"
