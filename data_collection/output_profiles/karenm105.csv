Fabulous,"What a great night. Interactive and fun. So much talent. Singing, comedy, acrobatics. Can’t wait to take other family members. So much fun!!!",Date of visit: July 2019,Teatro ZinZanni,4,"Seattle, Washington"
Highly recommend!!,We decided to do this trip...different from all the sunset cruises that are offered. We are so glad we did. Anthi was great as were her crew. Interesting to see how the traditional fishing is done. The onboard lunch of all the fish caught was exceptional. You can partake in as much or as little as you wanted. I would highly recommend this excursion over the regular catamaran cruises. She comes from a long line of fisherman. Nice to see a woman at the helm. Probably one of best days on Santorini. Thank you!!!!,Date of experience: June 2019,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Excellent,"The hotel we stayed at recommended this restaurant and we were not disappointed. It does not have the view that most are looking for when visiting Santorini but why do you need the view every night? The fava appetizer was delicious. We could have had a second order and called it a meal. It was that good. Helen told us how she made it, and yes I will attempt the instructions she gave. I ordered the chicken with lemon and herb and again, it was delicious. My husband had the lamb souvlaki and thought it was fantastic. The whole experience was great. Small and intimate restaurant. The staff when needed were warm and served with a smile. We have several more days in Santorini and we will definitely be visiting again. These negative reviews I read must have been people that either don’t travel much or people that cannot be pleased. Ignore those reviews. One of the best meals we have eaten in Greece so far.",Date of visit: May 2019,Nikolas Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Fantastic,"We were part of a tour group that had a cooking class here. Unfortunately we did not have the opportunity to stay in the accommodations. What we did see of them, which Erwin kindly showed us, was just lovely. The property overlooks the quiet country side. Something that is right up our alley. Back to the cooking class. The class instruction was easily followed and they encouraged each of us to take part. The final meal was absolutely delicious. I will definitely be recreating it soon. The family are so sweet. A good balance between friendly and professional. I would definitely revisit this place again if visiting the area. A wonderful experience. Thank you!!",Date of stay: June 2018,Hofgut Hafnerleiten,4,"Bad Birnbach, Germany"
"Great people, great place!!","We had the chance to visit the farm and meet the family. This place has so much to offer. If you haven’t tried the bread, you absolutely have to!! I was partial to the olive bread. The amount of plants was impressive, the fresh produce delicious. You can tell they love what they do. A little bit of everything and everything done so well. The family are one of the most lovely I have met. Definitely stop by when you’re passing through. You won’t be sorry.",Date of experience: April 2018,Eleuthera Island Farm,4,Eleuthera
Beautiful Resort,"We had a large organized trip for the last week of January ‘18. We have visited a lot of resorts and this one is probably my favourite. It was small enough that we were able to see every one walking about. We did have events most evenings and visited all restaurants. Our first and last dinner was at Aqua with a private table set apart. Food was outstanding on both nights. Thanks so much Mauricio and Luis, your service was great. Next was Portafino, Himitsu and Seaside Grill in that order. There are a few other places to grab breakfast and lunch or quick snack. Drinks at bars are above grade. We were spoiled with the Presidential Suite so I have absolutely no complaints with the room. Very roomy both inside and out. The entire staff are so friendly and helpful. And they are sincerely happy to help. Not once did I feel that anywhere was crowded like those huge resorts. I much prefer this size. I think they have about 200 rooms. Wildlife...monkeys, parakeets, iguanas, all types of birds outside our room. Loved seeing them all. It’s a short ride from the airport but never heard an planes overhead. Yes it is hilly, we walked most everywhere but the odd time took a shuttle which was always running and never a wait at all. Would it have been different if we weren’t with a big group? I don’t think so after reading the other reviews. This is a great resort with great food and especially great staff. Pura Vida!! Thank you so much.",Date of stay: January 2018,Secrets Papagayo Costa Rica,4,"Gulf of Papagayo, Costa Rica"
Great spa...wonderful staff,"I have been a client of Tiffany’s at Let it Heal for around 10 years or more. It’s safe to say I have made the move with them every time (like many others undoubtedly). That says a lot about the service they offer and the people they are. With their recent addition of a new business, Spa in the Village, it only made sense to move downtown Burlington to incorporate both businesses under one roof. I treated both my mum and daughter for their birthdays recently, and was enjoyed by all. They had facials and pedicures and I chose aromatherapy massage and manicure. The staff are wonderful, the building decor is beautiful and services that were received by us were very good. Give yourself an hour or two to unwind and relax, or purchase a gift certificate for someone in your life who you think deserves some time for them. These girls are great!! I live in the states now but every time I come to visit I book an appt. I will continue to do so and now with the option of additional services I just may need to spend a day rather an hour hahaha. On a side note, there is some beautiful artwork hanging in the spa that is for sale. Done by one of their talented employees. Be sure to check them out as well. Good luck ladies. I am sure your new adventure will be a success!!",Date of experience: December 2017,Spa in the Village,4,"Burlington, Canada"
Outstanding,"Outstanding
We recently stayed at Douglas Park Guest House for 5 nights and we loved it. Ken and Shona were so warm and welcoming throughout the entire stay. We stayed in room 3 that overlooks the water. What a view to wake up to every morning!! Bed was most comfortable as well. There is plenty of food for breakfast including fully cooked...delicious. The house itself is beautiful inside and out. You can tell they love what they do. It is a short walk to town (20/25 min). Two ferry docks within easy reach, loads of hiking. It is probably the best B and B we have stayed at. I think that has a lot to say about the owners. Again, very warm and welcoming and they will make sure your stay is the best possible. Can't forget Tilly. Lovely little dog if you're missing your own. Very highly recommended. Miss their hospitality already. Along with their haggis!!",Date of stay: August 2017,Douglas Park Guest House,4,"Dunoon, United Kingdom"
Great restaurant,We visited this restaurant twice in our five night stay in Dunoon. great service and food was excellent. One of the best pizzas we have tasted this side of Italy. You also have to try the gingerbread cheesecake!!!you will not be disappointed. Do call ahead to book a table because they fill up fast.,Date of visit: August 2017,Livingstone's,4,"Dunoon, United Kingdom"
Wish we could have stayed longer,"We stopped overnight and wish we could have stayed longer. I can't say enough about how beautiful a spot this is. The staff were great, food was excellent. On our overnight stay the Power went out but they continued with their service as best they could... which was great. I couldn't get my dessert but they delivered, as requested, to have it for breakfast. It was the best bread pudding ever...was delighted with the custard that arrived with it. Nice finish to my breakfast. Thanks Ben for passing that request on. It's the little things that make holidays special. Thanks for that. Loads of great hiking and beautiful views. Will highly recommend this to others passing through. Thank you for your service and attention John, Jess, Ben and all the others we did not have a chance to meet.",Date of stay: August 2017,Haweswater Hotel,4,"Bampton, United Kingdom"
Great little place,Stopped in on our walk about Edinburgh. Was not disappointed. Staff was great. Food is simple but oh so good!!! Who would have thought (not me) to have pea and mint soup. Absolutely delicious!!!,Date of visit: August 2017,The Ensign Ewart,4,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Great view but ...,Nice little walk up and great views but we were disappointed in the garbage. All bins were full and excess was blowing about. Don't quite understand such a wonderful city that caters to tourists but doesn't empty garbages. It really does give a wonderful 360 degree view of city though,Date of experience: August 2017,Calton Hill,4,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Nice but...,"The old town is a great place, lots of history, restaurants and shops. We were a little disappointed with the garbage though. Bins all over the place and most over flowing. With such a big tourist spot I would have expected a little cleaner city. It detracts from the overall beauty of the place.",Date of experience: August 2017,Edinburgh Old Town,4,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Wonderful,"Known as the oldest liquor serving establishment in Scotland. Wonderful, quaint and everything expected. Staff was great, food was outstanding. Not your usual pub style food. Was very good!!!! They seem to have a great chef. Would highly recommend for a good evening out",Date of visit: August 2017,The Sheep Heid Inn,4,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Beautiful,"We spent the weekend at Sycamore House while visiting for a family reunion. We were both extremely pleased with the welcome, location, beauty and full breakfast. The grounds are gorgeous and apparently Giovanna tends to them all!! Rooms are on lower level with private entrance for both rooms. You can tell they have put a lot of thought and effort into their accommodations. We stayed in the green pheasant room and it was lovely with own ensuite. I would highly recommend the Sycamore House and we will be staying again next time we are in area. Well done ladies...a beautiful home and wonderful service!! Thank you Maria and Giovanna.",Date of stay: July 2017,Sycamore House B&B,4,"Kingsville, Canada"
Spectacular,"A large group of us visited Talon Lodge beginning of June. I cannot speak highly enough of the service and location. Phil and Gwen were very welcoming, entertaining and engaged with their guests. It didn't stop with them; the staff (Jessica, Teryn, Laney (sp?), all kitchen staff and anyone I am forgetting (sorry) are so attentive and friendly noticing when plates were empty, drinks needing refills. We never had to ask for anything The massage therapists, Callie and Ashley (sp?) were so good at their job. Everyone enjoyed their time with them. All the staff went above what I have ever experienced. It was probably the best I have experienced and I have stayed at some very nice places. The food? Fabulous. Chef was amazing!!! Our evening meals were always very very good. On to the fishing...what an experience. The crew were patient with us non fishers and clearly instructed us to the handling of bringing in the fish. Shout out to Cole, Gavin, Brooks and Eric. I know others in our group enjoyed their captains and deck hands. Snacks, lunch and drinks on the boats were much appreciated. Our rooms were simple but oh so very comfortable. I was a bit unsure about going (not a big water person), but I can definitely say they won me over. So much so that I didn't want to leave, or at least would like to return. What a positive, fun, exhilarating time!!! Phil, Gwen and all their staff work hard yet remain fun and engaged with their guests. I would highly, HIGHLY recommend a visit to Talon Lodge. We received our shipment of fish yesterday and can't wait to cook up. May take a while...there is a lot. Thank you to all at Talon Lodge.",Date of stay: June 2017,Talon Lodge & Spa,4,"Sitka, Alaska"
Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this but from my initial call prior to visiting I wasn't that impressed. The agent on phone was not forthcoming with information. It was like pulling teeth. Once I arrived the ticket agent was not very helpful or personable. It took a woman from the entrance into the ship/hotel to explain what was required so back to ticket agent I went. She still wasn't very personable. I purchase my basic ticket and off I go on my self guided tour. There is no audio available. Just read your way through. I'm sure the guided tour (which I ran into) would offer more interesting information but cannot comment on that or the haunted tours. Everything seemed to be blocked off except the engine room and 4th deck (shopping). Overall I found it very disappointing. I did wander into the guest room areas just to see a bit more (but not much). I realize renovations are required on something as old as this ship but honestly, save your money. Best part of the visit was the uber drive. On a side note...I generally only leave positive recommendations but this one needed saying. If there was a family doing this it would be very expensive. I would check beforehand before going.",Date of experience: April 2017,The Queen Mary,4,"Long Beach, California"
Delish,"Nice restaurant and delicious food. I wasn't that hungry but everything on menu looked good. Hubby and I split the sautéed mussels, followed by the clam chowder. We split the crab dinner (1.5 lbs) with two sides. All in all, food was great, staff attentive and nice looking restaurant.",Date of visit: April 2017,King's Fish House,4,"Long Beach, California"
Amazing,"Booked this restaurant as it was listed as close to hotel we were staying at. Probably the first in a long time I didn't check with TripAdvisor. We were not disappointed. The food, staff and decor were all great. We had the back corner booth which made it a bit more intimate and quiet. The menu is not something I would regularly go for but was intrigued when I read the menu online. It was fabulous. The staff were courteous and attentive without being intrusive. I would highly recommend a visit to this restaurant. We will definitely be back!!",Date of visit: October 2016,Le Colonial,4,"Chicago, Illinois"
Country accommodations close to city,"Lovely B and B situated in the country but centrally located to so many cities in southern Ontario. Shane and Alan were both very welcoming and accommodating. There if you needed them and left you alone if you didn't. Bed (at least mine) was comfortable and breakfast was available as much as you choose to partake. You may go home a bit heavier . Fresh croissants daily, fresh fruit, hot cooked full breakfast. The choice is yours. This place is very dog friendly as well. A nice option when traveling with your furry friends. I would definitely recommend booking a stay if you're in the area. You won't be sorry.",Date of stay: September 2016,Serenity Ranch Bed and Breakfast,4,"Ancaster, Canada"
Great company,"I booked this tour while hubby was working. Having been to San Fran before, it was a great tour and Chad provided information and history that I hadn't heard before. Informative and fun. Chad is passionate and you can tell he enjoys his job. Loved the small tour. You get much more out of the small group experience. I would highly recommend this tour group to all who visit San Fran.",Date of experience: June 2016,Painted Ladies Tour Company,4,"San Francisco, California"
Magnificent,"This restaurant came recommended by one of the cooks that we met in town (sorry I forgot his name). The view over the hills in Gaiole in Chianti were beautiful. The wine list very good. Service was good. But the food? One of the best, and we eat at a lot of high end places. It was a relaxing evening and comfortable. Not stuffy like some fine dining restaurants. Loved how the chef (Andrea Oppo), served the courses himself and described the meal in detail. Nice touch having the chef come out to every table. Would definitely recommend people to search out this restaurant on top of the hill. Bumpy ride up but well worth it!!!",Date of visit: May 2016,Le Contrade Bistrot,4,"Gaiole in Chianti, Italy"
Great place centrally located,We stayed here our last three nights in Rome. Glad we had a driver drop us off or not sure we would have found it. The staff were wonderful and very helpful. We walked to most sites so it was great in that respect. Lots of shopping and restaurants close by. A beautiful little room overlooking the Beredini Gardens. Modern decor. Would highly recommend staying here.,Date of stay: May 2016,Terrazza Marco Antonio Luxury Suite,4,"Rome, Italy"
Amazing experience,"Can't say enough about this restaurant. Great wines, amazing food and service was outstanding!!! I have never seen people enjoy their jobs so much...helps when it is family run. Truly a magnificent experience.",Date of visit: May 2016,Al Covo,4,"Venice, Italy"
A must visit,Old world charm. Lovely lunch opening up onto the square with the addition of live music. A must touristy visit to while away an hour or so watching the happenings on the square. If the walls could talk in this 'oldest' cafe in Europe.,Date of visit: May 2016,Cafe Florian,4,"Venice, Italy"
Highly recommend. Great location and staff is awesome.,"This is our first stay here and would definitely return.the location is great, very close to main street with shopping and restaurants. We had a creekside cottage with lovely real firplace. The staff are very welcoming and warm. The restaurant is one of the best for real foodies. Our stay was unfortuantley too short. A shout out to our server Tanya and to Chase the shuttle driver. We will definitely be back.",Date of stay: January 2015,L'Auberge de Sedona,4,"Sedona, Arizona"
Wish we could have stayed longer,"We booked into Castle Leslie while touring Ireland. It was everything we expected and more. Being an old castle I was surprised at how clean and dust free everything was. The reception staff was wonderful. They accommodated our request to stay in a specific room. The grounds are beautiful and the whole place so relaxing. We had a two night stay there but both my husband and I could have stayed longer to take advantage of the activities offered on the estate. We stayed in the castle but they also have the lodge with 29 (?) additional rooms and the mews. Their restaurant, Snaffles, was well beyond our expectations as well. We travel extensively and eat at some high end restaurants...Castle Leslie is right up there at the top.",Date of stay: July 2014,Castle Leslie Estate,4,"Glaslough, Ireland"
Great little place in quaint irish village,We had dinner at the pizzeria one night while staying at Castle Leslie upon the recommendation of a family member. We did not realize it was BYOB so my husband slipped out for a bottle of wine to enjoy with our meal. They were extremely busy but managed to fit us in. We don't mind sharing a meal with a strangers so were seated with a family outdoors. Pizza and service was good. I would recommend making reservations as it fills up quickly. Did not have the chance to experience the tea room so cannot comment. I would definitely recommend checking this quaint place out.,Date of visit: July 2014,Ambledown Tea Rooms,4,"Glaslough, Ireland"
Great food,We stumbled up in the Black Cat on our stay in Galway. Although they were busy Aelish managed to fit us in. We enjoyed it so much we booked for another night. The food is wonderful and presentation just as good. Would definitely recommend reservations as it is a small restaurant and fills up quickly. The only down side is it's a bit noisy...probably due to acoustics of building. But all in all a wonderful place to eat.,Date of visit: August 2014,Black Cat,4,"Galway, Ireland"
Wouldn't stay anywhere else,We stayed with Donna at Roseleigh House on two separate nights while touring Ireland. Roseleigh is a beautiful home and Donna made us very comfortable. She has a passion for what she does and it shows in all she does. The breakfasts were amazing!!! And the bed???? One of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. It is located within 30 minutes of city centre and is a pleasant walk. Thank you so much Donna for your hospitality. I will definitely be recommending you to others. Wish we could have spent more time.,Date of stay: August 2014,Roseleigh House,4,"Belfast, United Kingdom"
Old world charm,Great place. food and service were outstanding. they seat you in the library initially where you can order a drink and choose your meal. When your meal is ready they come to seat you at your table. Would highly recommend for a nice evening out or a celebratory meal.,Date of visit: May 2014,Grace Restaurant at the Carnegie Inn,4,"State College, Pennsylvania"
Outstanding!!!,"My husband and I recently had our wedding ceremony here. it was just the two us and perfect beyond our expectations. The grounds are truly beautiful, the staff are so welcoming and gracious. The rooms (we had the Valencia Suite) are spacious yet homey. we stayed for three nights and could easily have stayed longer. the Veladora restaurant was outstanding. I have worked with some fantastic chefs and this was memorable. The. Pony room is a great place to relax and have a light meal and/or drinks. all the staff were attentive yet not intrusive. we can't wait to return. I would highly recommend staying here. It may be a little expensive for some but well worth it for a special occasion. a special thank you to Danielle who organized our special day.",Date of stay: November 2013,Rancho Valencia Resort and Spa,4,"Rancho Santa Fe, California"
Worth the wait,"We visited this restaurant on a recent weekend trip to Santa Monica. Reservations had been made by friends thankfully because the place was busting with patrons. We were able to sit on the quaint patio and enjoyed several small plates. The pizza was the best I have tasted, the mixed mushroom and the chorizo sausage. Between four of us we had I think 8 small plates. A lot of food. I found the staff helpful, professional and friendly. Would definitely recommend this place if visiting the area but please make reservations or you could be waiting awhile. Excellent restaurant, would go back again if in the area",Date of visit: May 2013,Gjelina,4,"Los Angeles, California"
Excellent,"Can't say enough about this restaurant. The service was outstanding without being intrusive. All the staff was friendly upon arrival at the front reception, the bar staff and servers. The food was tasty and well presented. The view from the outdoor terrace was beautiful. Time it right and you can can enjoy the sunset. They also have the patio heaters for when its a little cooler. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a special evening, celebration or just to share an evening with that someone special. Fabulous!!!!",Date of visit: April 2013,Sale E Pepe,4,"Marco Island, Florida"
Great place,Really liked this place. The food was great. The owner came out to take our order. Wish we were able to visit a second time. If we find ourselves on marco island again will definitely go back.,Date of visit: April 2013,Davide Italian Cafe,4,"Marco Island, Florida"
Fantastic hotel,"Recently spent a weekend at this hotel and was very thrilled with everything. The only thing I could say was wish we were there for a week! The staff was wonderful, courteous, professional in a warm manner. Our king suite was amazing. Spacious and well decorated. Would recommend this hotel to everyone. Unfortunately did not have the chance to use the spa but did have a tour and looked lovely. Would love to come back and visit. Pricey but you get what you pay for!
