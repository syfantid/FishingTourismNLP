Great Day Out,This was a really great trip and a fantastic experience. We had lovely hosts who made us feel very welcome and put on a great lunch from the days catch. We were able to watch the nets being pulled in and the option for three swim stops. I would definitely recommend to anyone who likes to eat fish or would like to try more.,Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
