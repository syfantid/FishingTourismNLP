Great time with great people in Kefalonia,"We just got back from our trip to Kefalonia, where we had a wonderful time. We spent our last day in the island on the boat with Antonia and Michalis. We also got to know some very friendly Italians who happened to be our companions on the trip that day. It was a wonderful day. Not only did we enjoy a great, relaxing time and absolutely delicious, fresh food cooked on the boat, but we also got to see how much hardwork the profession of a fisherman implies. Also, Antonia was extremely kind and she even offered to give us a ride from and back to our accommodations, as we had to give our rented car back a day before the trip. We thank you for the beautiful day you gave us, Antonia and Michalis! Very recommended!",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
