Happy Day on the Boat,"An amazing day out for our group of 8 people!
A day filled with hands on fishing experience, snorkelling, home made wine and don't even get me started on the taste of the lunch they prepared from the freshly caught seafood!
Lots of unforgettable memories made on this beautiful trip with the warmest hosts in all Kefalonia. Totally recommended :)",Date of experience: May 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
