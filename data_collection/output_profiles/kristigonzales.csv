until then , I m keeping the great memories!!!",Date of experience: July 2016,Giorgaros fishing tours Santorini,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Highly engaging and enjoyable!,"For me it was the perfect introduction to the Greek Spirit!! The way the actors interacted with us and with each other! Knowing they are doing this every night the show is surprisingly fresh and the actors super polite and fun!
I loved it when they did a special toast for our friend who had his birthday!
The actors amazing, the venue wonderful, the wine delicious and the food is great, is also there to add to the authenticity: don t forget we are in the '40's!",Date of experience: July 2016,The White Door Theatro,4,"Santorini, Greece"
beautiful experience!!!,"Amazing opportunity to ride in beautiful Santorini, going to a nearly private beach with the horses ..
From helping us to get to know our horses until the staying extra and help us taking pictures the staff was wonderful with us!
It was the perfect combination of feeling adventurous but safe at all times!
Super fun and romantic, even though I just did it with a group of friends, I ll be thrilled to go back with my boyfriend and take photos and videos!
He might even be inspired to propose as a proper principito azul - a knight with the white horse!",Date of experience: July 2016,Experience Horse Riding,4,"Santorini, Greece"
fun and beautiful!,"we ve driving and driving to get there, it was completely dark but after we arrived it was magical!
it was so much fun having couple of beers in the lighthouse during the night! so peaceful and beautiful!",Date of experience: July 2016,Lighthouse,4,"Santorini, Greece"
it's a pitty but...,"It looks like a nice place and me and my friends where having so much fun at the beginning! we ve been there 3 times and thought that, that was our bar for our 10 days stay, but a friend was involved in an incident and was a real bummer for all of us.. on a busy night someone of the stuff insisted that we havent paid some of our drinks and wanted to make us pay, which we finally did because we didnt want to ruin completely the fun we just had but we didnt trust them to go back!",Date of visit: June 2016,Tranquilo,4,"Santorini, Greece"
chilling and wonderful,"either for relaxing on the sand beds on the beach (I love the rocks on the sea infront of the bar) either tasting the food (risoto with shrimps was my favorite ) either enjoying the best strawberry daquiry on the island during the night and listening to a great band (I think the name is namaste) it is always enjoyable to spent time there!
it is not just any beach bar, it is THE Beach Bar, open since 1979.. you can feel how welcoming and charming are the owners even (or especially) after over 35 years in the business!!!
plus Yanis is a great dj!!",Date of visit: July 2016,The Beach bar,4,"Santorini, Greece"
