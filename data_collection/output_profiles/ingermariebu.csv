A lot of funn for all ages,"Best thing to do when you are in Rhodes. My son (10 years) loved this tour. We were in Rhodes in July. It was good to get some ocean breeze in the hair and to cool of on a boat trip. Captain Manolis is the best! He was so good with the kids and he gave us an experience and knowledge for life! During summertime the fish isnâ€™t that big, but who cares when you are having such a good time. While the Captain was preparing the food, we had time to go swimming in the ocean. The water was clear, and I recommend you bring diving masks. The fish and salad on the bout were so delicious. During 8 days in Rhodes we went on this trip 4 times. We are coming back next time we are visiting Rhodes!",Date of experience: July 2018,Captain Manolis Fishing Trips in Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
