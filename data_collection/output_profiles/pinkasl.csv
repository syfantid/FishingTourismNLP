I cAnt express my pleasure with experience we got by using Milos Experience road trip company . Owner Michalis Vamvarakis is a great , wonderful super honest person . You can trust him explicitly !
Our driver Panos was very passionate , showed us many “hidden from tourists “ places . The time passed very fast and we had a great experience.
You will be never disappointed by knowing Michalis and Panos !!!!
