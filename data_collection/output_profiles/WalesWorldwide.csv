What an amazing day!,"What an amazing day we had. From the moment we arrived on the boat to be greeted by traditional greek coffee and pastries we were made to feel welcome and part of Giorgio‘s fishing family.
We were all taught how to let the net out and bring it back in and my son even caught his own fish by line fishing which completely made his day.
We ate what we caught, all cooked by Giorgio’s mother in law, and what a spread we had all washed down with Giorgio’s home made wine and ouzo. One of the highlights of the trip was stopping off at an uninhabited private island in Zone A of the marine conservation area, where we got to snorkel and jump/dive off the boat and swim to the island.
I can’t recommend this trip enough, it was the highlight of our holiday for us and my two children and if you only do one trip while on Zakynthos do this one.",Date of experience: August 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
