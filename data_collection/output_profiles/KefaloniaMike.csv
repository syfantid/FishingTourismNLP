Magical Day.,"Don't miss this trip!
It was one of the most memorable times of my life, thanks to Captain Dimitrios, Efi, Mohammed and Eva.

Great food and great company, all arranged by my lovely daughter Alison, my partner Lynne and Alex my son in law. (Big thank to you. X)
Hospitality on board was second to none! Awesome day!!!
It all went to make my 'early' 70th Birthday the best ever.
