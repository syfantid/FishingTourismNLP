Very expensive drinks,"One gin and tonic and one malibu and coke €17, the most expensive in Katelios.
When I told the waitress that the price was expensive she said to tell the owner which I did, he then went into a rant about how much he got charged for toast in England!
IDIOT. Perhaps he should question why of an evening his bar is so empty compared to the others.",Date of visit: September 2019,Floridita,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Wonderful day out!,"This was a belated birthday treat for my husband for his 60th and we both loved it. Nothing was too much trouble from start to finish, Efi's English is excellent and was so knowledgeable about the different kinds of fish, and all three of them were so friendly and jolly.
After first getting to know the other passengers over coffee, tea and biscuits we set sail to the first of two areas where the nets were waiting to be brought aboard and you could help as little or as much as you wanted, it was great fun.We stopped at two small beaches which could only be reached by boat and the water was so clear and a beautiful turquoise. You could get off the boat and swim if you wanted to and at the second stop you could swim ashore and cover yourselves in the liquid clay which Efi told us would take 10 years off our husbands, this bit she was telling fibs about!!!!!.
During this time they cooked the fish they had caught and then laid the table with it plus potato dishes, salad and bread and home produced wine or beer, cold drinks and water.
It was such a great day with good company and wonderful hosts. We would definitely do it again.",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
