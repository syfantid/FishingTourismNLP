Unforgettable day!!!,"An amazing way to start your day. We booked from 9am-1pm trip and was just perfect. The only bothering thing was a very strong wind, but we survived :) Must do it if you are in Rhodos!",Date of experience: September 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
The best restaurant in Cacak,"Definetely my favorite place to eat! If you are a tourist, you must eat here. The only thing little annoying is the owner who is sitting in his own restaurant and smoke in front of the guests. This should be forbidden. Food delicious!",Date of visit: November 2018,Restoran Petrović,1,"Cacak, Serbia"
Lovely dinner,"Everytime we stop by this lovely city Castellamare del Golfo, we dine in Cumpa restaurant. Never let us down. We have tried almost all the dishes from the menu and everything was good. Only one time we had a small issue, due to not cleaned fish properly. In the end, we got offered sweets. Must try vegetarian pasta and fritto misto. At our last visit, they had available only 2 kind of sweets, which is kind of poor for such a busy restaurant like this.",Date of visit: August 2019,Cumpa ristorante,1,"Sicily, Italy"
Wonderful gateway!,"A lovely calm and quiet place to escape from life routine. Swimming pool was cristal clear with plenty of olive trees throwing a shadow on sunbeds. Breakfast was great! Housekeeping really kind. As for our room with a balcony, all was good and newly furnished except the bed. It was really a torture to sleep and wake up in this bed! When you lay down you feel every single wire inside of the mattress. For the cleanliness we give 10! Must visit an amazing Guidaloca beach, which is 2min by car away and make sure you have a proper shoes for the beach. I have to add that it was our first marriage anniversary and my husband surprised me with a bottle of spumante on arrival and we got charged an additional 20€. We had no problem of paying it, but I guess it's fine to have it offered by the property. Overall, highly recommended!",Date of stay: August 2019,Casale La Macina - Hotel e Residence,1,"Sicily, Italy"
The best pizza and arancine,"If you want to eat the best pizza and traditional Sicilian arancine in Sciacca, Steripinto is a place for you. They make pizza with love! But be prepared to wait a long time until you get your order served on the table, if you come in late hours. Recommend to go between 7-8pm.",Date of visit: July 2019,Pizzeria Steripinto,1,"Sicily, Italy"

Disaster!!!,"This restaurant has a potential, but only the restaurant. Our story started when we booked a table for 5 persons on the day of Easter for lunch. However, 3 persons weren't able to come so we informed the restaurant 3 days in advance and since we paid the deposit we didn't wanted to lose the money obviously, so we went there for a lunch. Set menu is on, 30€/person. My husband took the fish menu and I chose the meat. They didn't have ready the meat menu so on the day of reservatio, the owner of the restaurant said we will call you to tell you the menu for the meat. We were seated at the table at 13:30h. Soon after, the appetizers came and after drinks. First course came after 55min of waiting and this is a shame and absolutely nobody has approached the table to say something, but still we were patient. Main course came after 45min, my husband first receives wrong dish and after 5min receives his main but COLD! Still I didn't get my main dish and while he was waiting for me, his dish got completely cold. By the way his main was 1 piece of gamberi and 2 pieces of involtini di pesce spada VERY DRY! Finally, I got my main which was a rare fillet. When you are ordering fillet, which I didn't know I will get because they never called back to tell me, you need to ask the guests how they would like meat to be cooked!!! Of course, tired of waiting we didn't have power to complain. We call the waiter who took both plates not even touched without even asking what is wrong or to show the will to do something. He grabbed both plates and left. We asked for desserts. During all this time, the most impressive thing is the owner who stood up by the door with crossed hands and absolutely did nothing in a busy day like this!!! And he was next to our table all the time, not even to apologize for his mistake. He didn't show interest for anything, not even to greet the customers and say goodbye to them!!! We spend 3 hours there, the longest 3 hours! NO ORGANIZATION, NO CARE, staff liked forced to work there. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN!!!",Date of visit: April 2019,Art Déco,1,"Sicily, Italy"
