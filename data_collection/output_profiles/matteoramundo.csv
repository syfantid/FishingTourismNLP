A magic experience,"A magic experience, no other words to define it!

Not only because of the beautiful trip in the magnificent landscapes of Milos but mainly for the way the captain Kiriakos, Tina and the other nice man of the crew have committed themselves in making the trip something unforgettable for us.

We were 2 families (8 people totally), the boat welcomes us very comfortably. We went fishing in the gulf, theyâ€™ve cooked a delicious psarosoupa (fish soup) for all of us. We also succeded in fishing 5 squids (!) that made our kids (and us) superexcited.
They also grilled for us one of them!

An authentic experience, not to miss!",Date of experience: August 2018,Milos Fishing Trip,5,"Milos, Greece"
