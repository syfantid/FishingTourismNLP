The best guide in Jaisalmer,"We toured the city with Harish and he was fabulous. Very knowledgeable and the sweetest guy! He shared all the fun tidbits about Gadisar Lake, Patwon ki Haveli and the Fort. Also shared a refreshing drink with my husband and I when we were done with our tour and told us about his family and his own travels. He is very professional and really strives to make sure his guests have the best time. 100% recommended!",Date of experience: September 2019,Jaisalmer Tour Guide,4,"Jaisalmer, India"

Fantastic Location,Tania and her family makes you feel like a part of their family. The property is very well maintained and cozy. We were comfortable and the views are amazing.

Best Tour in Hanoi!,"We got to try so many different foods and Tai looked after us extremely well. He attended to all our wishes and didn't limit our tour to just food. We loved Tai and how much he helped us understand his wonderful city. He had a ton of knowledge to keep us intrigued and taught us a lot. Would visit again just see our new friend, Tai",Date of experience: January 2019,Tours By Locals,4,"Hanoi, Vietnam"

Highlight of the trip,"What’s there to say that hasn’t already been said. Steve, our guide, was attentive, knowledgeable, and charismatic. Hé made sure our dietary needs were met and really showed us a fantastic time. The tuk tuk rides showed us a lot of the country. He and his partner curated a great tour to teach you about the food and also the people. Absolutely recommended! Cant miss.",Date of experience: December 2018,Siem Reap Food Tours,4,"Siem Reap, Cambodia"
Private Day Tour,We had Ken as our guide and he was just perfect. His enthusiasm for the food and knowledge of the history and culture opened our eyes to the possibilities of Malay cuisine. The tour was comfortable in a private car with a little bit of walking but the experience was top notch. We felt well looked after by Ken and was of course fed incredibly well. Highly recommended for anyone interested in eating true Malay cuisine!,Date of experience: December 2018,Food Tour Malaysia,4,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"
A Piece of Heaven,"Leela Udaipur is by far our absolute favorite hotel experience in the world, thus far. We have stayed at over 20 different hotels in the last 4 years, both boutique and part of a Group, but the hospitality and crucial attention to detail at Leela has been unmatched. Starting from our pickup at the airport by Mr. Kamal to a surprise sunset boat ride with a cake to celebrate our anniversary, the staff at Leela are fantastic and truly strive to make their guests happy. Elty was our butler and did everything to make sure our 5 year anniversary was nothing short of special. We didn’t even ask for the wonderful additions but she happily set everything up for us. The gesture and surrounding beauty of the lake and hotel nearly brought tears to my eyes. The hotel itself is spotless with gorgeous decor throughout. I’d recommend experiencing The Leela to every one who visits!",Date of stay: April 2018,The Leela Palace Udaipur,4,"Udaipur, India"
FOODIE PARADISE,My husband and I were unaware of Bohri people and their specific traditions so this was the best learning experience. We were welcomed into someone’s home and sat around a huge thaali with about 10-12 more people. The 8 course feast was absolutely perfect bite after bite and note after note. What a symphony of flavors that we don’t think we’ve experienced anywhere else. Nafisa Aunty who overlooked every item is a Master Chef and her love and passion for her cooking shines through. Come hungry and leave veryyy happy!!,Date of visit: April 2018,The Bohri Kitchen,4,"Mumbai, India"
Delhi to Agra - Taj Mahal,"My husband and I were picked up by our driver, Subodh, from our hotel. He drove for about 4 hrs each way from and back to Delhi. He was a safe driver who took very good care of us during the journey. He was able to communicate well with us in English and made the trip very comfortable!
Our guide in Agra was Mr. Arif. He was a extremely knowledgeable and gave very interesting info throughout out the trip. He gave us plenty of time to enjoy Taj Mahal and took some seriously amazing shots for us. Maybe in another life he should consider photography as another career choice. Then he took us to a marble artifact making shop where we saw how the marbles are carved and in-laid with various semi-precious stones. Our final stop (after lunch) was Agra Fort. Such a majestic complex and Mr Arif knew so much about all the parts open to public. He took very good care of us and was a joy to be with!",Date of experience: April 2018,Chaman Duggal Private Tours,4,"New Delhi, India"
Clean and Renovated,We were upgraded to a room on the too floor with a great view of the marina. The room was spacious and well maintained. Staff was friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend staying here. If I were to come back with my husband we would stay at the Hamilton for sure. Marcus’ restaurant was fantastic with attentive waiters.,Date of stay: March 2018,"Hamilton Princess & Beach Club, a Fairmont Managed Hotel",4,Bermuda
Insanely Expensive,The menu at first glance looked great but once we ordered the food we were highly disappointed. It did not taste fresh and flavors were subpar. Even more disheartening was how much we had to shell out for such a mediocre meal.,Date of visit: March 2018,Lobster Pot,4,Bermuda
Good food!,My friend and I were getting very tored of the food in Bermuda. It just seemed like we kept giving away a ton of money for the most mediocre food. Swizzle Inn was a local recommendation and it was our first pleasant surprise. Yes the prices were unresonably high like everywhere else on the island but the food was not terrible for once! Recommend the steamed mussles in thai green curry sauce.,Date of visit: March 2018,Swizzle Inn,4,Bermuda
An Experience to Remember,"My husband and I visited Bianca and Katharina on our recent trip to Vienna. It was an extremely intimate and fun cooking class as Bianca made us feel completely at home. Literally. She invites us into her beautiful, modern apartment to make the dishes and is very warm and welcoming from beginning to end. She provides a lot of history and insights into the cooking techniques and the ingredients which was very enlightening. We loved this class and would take more classes if they were like this! The group was about 10 people but it didnt feel that way as everyone was comfortable with another. We thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend it 100% !",Date of experience: December 2017,Taste & Cook in Vienna with Bianca Is(s)t,4,"Vienna, Austria"
Great Hotel,The hotel is great and is kept up fairly well. The room was a good size but there are no views which is fine since we didn't spend a lot of time in the room. Our only negative was that we felt the room was about $50 more than what it should be given the quality of the stay. The city of Salzburg is expensive itself which is probably why the hotel cost more than it should. The staff was friendly and helpful.,Date of stay: December 2017,Sheraton Grand Salzburg,4,"Salzburg, Austria"
Great Bed and View,"The room is all white so every bit of dirt and hair is so extremely visible. The cleaning staff does an excellent job to keep the rooms clean every day, but it gets visibly ""dirty"" within minutes of being in the room due to the white floors, walls, furniture, everything. The rooms is modern in the sense that everything seems to be one open layout with sliding doors, but if I weren't staying with my husband I would find it extremely difficult to get any privacy. If you want privacy you need to shut the sliding and mirror doors but that limits your space ten-fold. It's easier to keep things open in this case as I traveled with the hubby. The view from our 7th floor room was excellent and we were able to see NYE fireworks from the comfort of our room. The bed is extremely comfortable. The 18th floor restaurant is a must visit but I do not recommend the expensive breakfast. The food options are very boring in the buffet and you are essentially just paying for the view.",Date of stay: December 2017,SO/ VIENNA,4,"Vienna, Austria"
Best Value!,This hotel is beautiful. The staff is polite and extremely helpful. The cleaning staff is barely noticeable so it always feels like your room is cleaned as if by magic. They do an impeccable job maintaining the rooms and keeping it spotless. For the price they charge this 5 star hotel is a complete steal. Location is perfect. I would recommend this place every time!,Date of stay: December 2017,La Ballerina,4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
Excellent views,We went up to the castle everyday just for the epic views. This complex really is the Highlight of the city.,Date of experience: December 2017,Prague Castle,4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
Left Stranded,"We booked roundtrip shuttles to and from hotel. We were picked up from the hotel just fine however I needed to change my pickup time from hotel on my departure date because by flight was leaving an hour earlier than I originally thought. I called at least 12 times DURING the office hours listed on their website and on my confirmation email. Nothing. No one picked up. No one answered my urgent email. I resorted to paying another $50 for another taxi to take us to the airport.
Completely unprofessional. Hire at your own risk. They may leave you stranded.",Date of experience: October 2017,Cancun Airport Transportation,4,"Cancun, Mexico"
Friendly and beautiful!,My husband and I went for 4 nights and we loved it! Although the food isn't that great we enjoyed the hospitality from the front desk staff. The resort is beautiful and well maintained. We ALWAYS saw someone sweeping or mopping or plastering a wall. Its nice but sometimes offputting to have someone sweeping right next to your dining table. The staff was very accommodating when we had a minor incident in our original room and they shifted us to a better room for our final night. The rooms smell a little damp bc of the humid weather and being so close to the sea but other than that the rooms are very clean and comfy. We wish the food options were better and more authentically mexican. We would definitely recommend to our friends!,Date of stay: October 2017,"Hilton Playa del Carmen, an All-Inclusive Adult Only Resort",4,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico"
Wonderful Stay,"My husband and I stayed at Wellenberg for the first 3 nights of our visit to Switzerland and it has been such a pleasure. The room was very clean and tidy. Minimalistic but jus enough. Im usually extremely picky about bedding and bathroom but Wellenberg was a pleasant surprise. I didnt feel uncomfortable at all. The location is extremely convenient with it being 10 mins from Zurich HB. They serve free breakfast every morning and the food was not excessive but perfectly adequate. I did not mind indulging every morning.

The staff was extremely nice and eager to help. We definitely get the hype about private boutique hotels now! Will definitely recommend for all Zurich visitors!",Date of stay: April 2017,Hotel Wellenberg,4,"Zurich, Switzerland"
Epic views!,We went during the Spring festivities and the views of all the marchers and musicians along Old Town was unforgettable,Date of experience: April 2017,Grossmunster,4,"Zurich, Switzerland"
Great location,"St. James is located near a couple of great tube stations which makes it very easy to travel to all corners of London. The hotel itself is well maintained except the extremely thin walls. I could hear what the family next door was saying and watching on TV which only means they can hear us as well. Thankfully we didn't spend too many hours in our room as we had a very packed schedule. The service was friendly and the room was small but adequate.

The only negative was that some of our most cherished souvenirs (pro photos taken of my husband and I in front of the Eiffel Tour) had completely vanished from the room. We kept all of our souvies in one corner and the bag from Paris had just disappeared into thin air. We told management and they came up to take a look and apparently asked all the housekeeping staff but no one claimed to have seen it. The staff did try to make amends by being very apologetic and deducted 50 pounds from our bill, however, it still left a bad taste.

I would recommend this hotel if you want to splurge a bit for a standard room but advantageous location. Just be careful of what you leave in the room!!",Date of stay: October 2016,"St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel",4,"London, United Kingdom"
2 Day Trips from London,We traveled to Stonehenge &Bath on one trip and The Cotswold on the second. The tour guides were very knowledgeable and shared a lot of funny anecdotes to keep our interest during the long drives. The spots were beautiful and we hd ample time to take a good look around ourselves. Didn't feel constricted for time and were able to explore. Highly recommended !,Date of experience: October 2016,Premium Tours - London Tours,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Brian was the BEST,I took a NYC Cocktail Tour with a private group. Brian was our tour leader. Brian was super enthusiastic and a fun guide with great historical knowledge of the St. Marks area we were touring. He made all the stops feel special and took very good care of the whole group. I would definitely do this tour again and it HAS to be with Brian :),Date of experience: December 2016,Urban Oyster Tours,4,"New York City, New York"
Long weekend in Montreal,This was a quick weekend getaway and I picked the Omni because it is perfectly situated in the center of town. A few blocks from McGill University which meant close to dozens of great restaurants and bars serving the huge student community. The hotel itself was clean and the staff was always helpful.,Date of stay: May 2016,Hotel Omni Mont-Royal,4,"Montreal, Canada"
2 nights only,My cousin and I booked the Ritz spontaneously. We were only in town for 2 days to experience Universal and Disney and we wanted to splurge on a lux hotel. The Ritz didn't disappoint. The hotel is beautiful located in a gorgeous property including a lake and golf course. We felt like royalty because of the sheer grandeur of the hotel but hoped the staff was a bit friendlier. The front desk seemed relatively snooty as they can tell we aren't Ritz regulars because of our age. But they were easy to overlook as we fully tried to enjoy the hotel amenities. Their restaurant downstairs serves a delicious breakfast buffet - priced as you would imagine for a 4 star hotel. Still loved our short stay at such a nice hotel!,Date of stay: March 2016,"The Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes",4,"Orlando, Florida"
