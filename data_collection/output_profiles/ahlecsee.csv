Best Hotel in Rhodes!,"I've just returned from a week long holiday at the Atrium Platinum with my family and I can say it is possibly the best hotel I've ever stayed in. I could not praise the staff of the hotel enough, from the moment we entered the hotel, everyone I've, encountered is friendly and helpful, especially the regular server at our table who remembered all my family's preferences by the second day. Although I didn't get his name I hope he gets the praise from his managers that he deserves. All the ppl I encountered checking out nearly all comment on the great staff it's not a fluke.
The hotel is always spotless, diverse choice of food, lobster night was an experience in itself of fine dining, reasonable prices around the hotel, the spa was also great and reasonably priced, the rooms were spacious and I would definitely return to the Atrium Platinum again.
The best example is when I spoke to one of the managers about the fantastic staff his reply was ""its how we do hospitality ""
Thank you to all of the staff for making my stay a very very enjoyable one!",Date of stay: July 2019,Atrium Platinum Luxury Resort Hotel & Spa,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
