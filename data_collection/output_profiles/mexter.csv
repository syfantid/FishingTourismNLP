Nice hotel at a good location,"I stayed one week in the village. Cosy and cute houses, calm atmosphere. Our room was very simple and had no decorations or anything, no wow-factor what so ever. White walls, a bed, a tv, but basically nothing else. It didnt bother me too much, but since it's labeled as a 4+ star hotel, I'd expect a bit more of the room. But the room was clean, and the wifi, AC, Tv and mini-fridge all worked great.

Whats really remarkable to my opinion is the staff. Every single person (that I came in contact with) working at Doryssa was super kind, helpful, service-minded and happy. From the front disk staff to the bartenders and the beach staff, everyone greeted us with a smile and had always time to answer questions or just chat for a minute. We felt well taken care of at all times.

+ close to the small town Pythagorio, where you find many good resturants, supermarkets, cafes, boat trip services etc.
+ close to the airport. Might be a - for some people, since the planes coming and going are quite loud, but I got used to it and didnt bother.
+ easy to rent a car, and there are so many places to go to around the island; beaches, small villages, historical places etc.",Date of stay: September 2019,Doryssa Seaside Resort,4,"Samos, Greece"
Samos Fishing Trips - a great experience,"My boyfriend and i went on this trip and both of us had a wonderful day. We took off in the morning, stopped to fish for a couple of hours and after catching plenty of fish we went to a beautiful area to swim, relax and have lunch together. I had no previous experience of fishing but that wasnâ€™t a problem at all. The kind hosts taught me everything I needed to know and I felt well taken care of. The lunch, including the fish that we caught earlier, was so delicious! And it really felt like hanging out with good friends, all thanks to the warm and friendly hosts who made everyone feel comfortable and happy. So, I recommend to go on this trip if you wanna have a fun and relaxed day on the sea, meet some new friends and experience the greek hospitality at its best. Thank you Nancy and Giannis!",Date of experience: September 2019,Samos Fishing Trips,4,"Samos, Greece"
