Amazing day out,"I can not recommend this trip enough. We were made so welcome from beginning to end and the trip was an amazing experience for us adults as well as the children. We consisted of 4 adults and 5 children ranging from 5 years old to 15. Our first impressions were how spotlessly clean the boat was and how friendly George was. He was cheerful and very informative. Even the kids listened!
After lowering the nets, we went swimming at a private island which was so beautiful. The children were amazed when we pulled the nets in and they saw all the fish that they’d caught. We then had another stop while George’s mother in law cooked for us. Absolutely delicious food. The kids even enjoyed it. George’s wine tasted amazing. Really great to see the kids tasting the fish that they’d caught. An unique experience for them. Thank you so much for a truly memorable day. The kids say it’s the best day of the holiday.",Date of experience: August 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Poor quality of food,"Although the view and position of this pub is lovely, the food is extremely poor and overpriced for what you get. First of all, I had to ask several times for someone to lean our table. The waiter said 2 minutes, but then kept on ignoring me and then I had to ask someone else. I had the curry which was a microwave meal that I watched them pour onto my plate. The meat was hard and dry, I could have bought much better on the corner shop. My youngest daughters kids meal was 3 hard burnt chicken goujons which were unedible. The other 2 meals were burgers, which were a little better. We’ll never go back, waste of money.",Date of visit: August 2018,Hotel Penwig Restaurant,1,"New Quay, United Kingdom"
Don't eat here!,We went for a meal here as soon as we arrived on Saturday. I was half way through my meal and found a bug in my food which looked like a wood louse. Manager came over and said that I didnt have to pay for my meal and that they had pest control in every week to spray the kitchens! Shocking! He explained as if this was a reasonabl explanation. He thought that the bug ha probably fallen into my food from the ceiling. Needless to say I spent the rest of the dy feeling quite sick!,Date of visit: February 2012,Planet Hollywood,1,"Marne-la-Vallee, France"
