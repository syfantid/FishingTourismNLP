Fantastic Experience !!,"Cannot recommend this enough! I had two teenage boys with me and we were all looked after from the moment we boarded the boat. As many soft drinks as we wanted and the crew were so friendly. Fishing was fun although due to high wind there weren’t as many as we had hoped for - I caught two (small ones) and the boys caught one, but still had a lot of fun trying. Couple of guys caught dragon fish which was exciting! Swimming was great and lunch was sensational! Highly recommend this trip for an afternoon or morning - I caught the bug and want to go fishing again!
