Disappointed,"For the money we payed, I felt disappointed could not see alot of amimals or they were too far away, could not find the elephants, was not given a map on arrival or even offered one, poor value the money",Date of experience: September 2020,Howletts Wild Animal Park,1,"Canterbury, United Kingdom"
Total rip off,"We stopped here as part of an excursion, looked ok and a man greeted everyone saying, if you have a packed lunch you were welcome to use their facilities, so we decided to order lunch, the menu only had about 7 main meals no mention of salad's or bread, my husband and I ordered a meal, they took our order and said would you like salad and bread, we said no, but he insisted by saying "" I give you salad and bread"", we had to wait ages for our food, which came out before we even had our drinks, food was tasteless, we were given no bill, just payed at bar, could not use card payment only cash and were charged for salad and bread which we did not want, several others complained of not ordering salad and had to pay and were also unhappy. The staff who bought the food out did not look very clean either, avoid eating here, ruined a great day out",Date of visit: June 2019,Taverna Kourites,1,"Crete, Greece"
Great 2 weeks,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 weeks, we arrived at 11 at night, we were saved some cold food, which was very welcome, I had emailed the hotel about a certain room, which we were given. Our room had lovely d√©cor, was clean and had everything we needed, including tea and coffee making facilities, fridge and king size bed. All hotel staff were very friendly and usually spoke to you, we used the spa, which was lovely, but the girls walking around getting customers, did speak after we had our massage. We went to the BBQ on a Wednesday evening, which was great, very nice food and entertainment. As you went to your table a photographer took your photo, nice idea, but did not really appreciate being approached over breakfast the next morning to buy the photos. Goergio and Olga were absolutely brilliant in the pool bar, always happy and worked very hard. Food was hot, always a good choice and tastey, with themed evenings. The hotel is inbetween Stalis and Malia, you can easily walk to either, lots of shops and bars right out side. I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family, thanks for a great holiday.",Date of stay: June 2019,Kyknos Beach Hotel & Bungalows,1,"Crete, Greece"

We had a amazing day which some very special people",Date of experience: June 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Lovely quiet vie,"Stayed here for 4 nights over the August bank holiday, had a lovely room at the front of building, when we arrived was greeted by a lady who showed us to our room, all was fine next morning at breakfast a young girl asked whether we wanted tea or coffee, and took our hot food order, did not ask if needed any more drink or make any other conversation, bread when toasted went hard, not nice, the other mornings we were greeted by another girl who was very nice and .made conversation, after 2 days our toilet roll ran out , we used spare, empty roll was left on holder , coffee was not replaced, and bed was made with decorative cushions under duvet little things but does not leave a good impression",Date of stay: August 2017,La Fosse at Cranborne,1,"Cranborne, United Kingdom"

Winter break,"We only booked a week at Elba, in December, just before our arrival we were reading the review's and started to wonder if we made the right choice, we arrived early evening, as we entered reception, are first thoughts was wow what a beautiful hotel, but then it took well over 1/2 hour to check in, we started to worry again, we finally got our key card, found our room, which we were pleased with, newly renovated and very modern, very comfortable beds loved the tea and coffee making facilities,
Had read lots of review's about the food, plates cold, food undercooked ect, we never experienced this quite the opposite, the staff were exceptional, always polite and very friendly, the girl greeting you as entering the restaurant, was very welcoming and smiley, the staff in animation deserve a mention to, always having time to talk and worked very hard.
Our room was always clean, as was the rest of the hotel,
Did not use the pools but there were always sunbeds available,.
Would recommend this hotel to family and friends, and perhaps one day would love to come back again",Date of stay: January 2017,Elba Lanzarote Royal Village Resort,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
