2nd Trip ... just as fabulous as the 1st !!,"This was our 2nd trip with Efi and Demitrios and was just as special as the 1st !
We had taken my 74 year old Mum along with us this time and after taking her to Fiskardo on a boat trip she was a little apprehensive due to the long day she had had on that boat trip ... however she was delighted to have been part of what she described as a super day and the best day of the holiday !
Efi and Demitrios along with Mohammed look after you so well and ensure your day is special for everyone on the boat.
The trip this time took a different route to haul in the catch of hake ( along with mackerel octopus rep snapper) and we yet again were taken to secluded beautiful bays to swim prior to lunch .
Efi surpasses herself with the food she prepares .. all home grown and Demitrios is a wonder to look at preparing the fish caught for lunch !
I would never tire of this trip ... relaxing ... interesting and wonderful people !!

Delicious !,"We had lunch here 5 times on our holiday ... there was 3 of us who all ate different things every time we went there and every time it didn't disappoint !
Homemade Greek food ... lion out for the specials they are fabulous ! And the Moussaka is the best in Katelios !",Date of visit: June 2017,Delicious,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great stay ... wonderful staff,"Visited Olhao for a short break and booked accommodation directly with hotel .
Staff on reception from arrival to departure were exceptional ... so very helpful and couldn't do more to make our stay throughly enjoyable .
Hotel is spotlessly clean . We stayed in a studio which was well equipped .... even though we didn't make use of anything in there as going out was more appealing !!
Poolside was again spotlessly clean and a super sun trap.
Breakfast at hotel was good lots of choice and is reasonably priced compared to what you pay in the town and you most certainly get more at the hotel.
Would definitely stay here again.

Olhao itself is a quiet traditional fishing town . If you like unspoilt.. non touristy towns it's a great place to base yourself .",Date of stay: May 2017,Hotel Cidade De Olhao,1,"Olhao, Portugal"
Not Good !!,Lunch .... starter of Tempura Prawns and Lobster Tacos ... OK ...bland very bland but OK. Now to to the main course .. both of us had Hake ... arrived looking as if it had sat at the pass for 5 minutes ... skim on top of bortllo beans and chorizo ... looked dry and most certainly was ! Was asked by our lovely waitress how the food was and told her very underwhelming ... she said I will get the manager .... asked us 10 mins later if the manager had been over to see us as they wanted the feedback... we said No ... I will get him ... asked for the bill ... manager bought over the bill ...didn't ask how everything had been and as we were sitting next to 2 girls who were just about to eat didn't want to complain .... how I regret that decision ... bill came charged for wine we didn't have and then charged for a bottle of wine that was £38 when the one we bought was £27 ... mistake I know but no apology from manager who bought the bill !! Only good thing was the Irish girl who served us ... lovely !!! The rest was awful !!!,Date of visit: November 2016,Neighbourhood,1,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"
Perfect !,"From start to finish the day couldn't have been more perfect ! We were welcomed onto the boat by Efi and Demetrios as if we were old friends and by the end of the day we certainly felt as if we had known them longer than a day. Efi and Demetrios along with Mohammed and Demetrios parent's made the day so wonderfully special.
The hauling in of the fishing nets.. to us novices trying to get our catch (lunch )of Red snapper .. Sea bream ... Squid .. out of the nets ... very very tricky but made to look so easy by Efi who I hasten to add had the patience of a saint with us when we seemed to get the fish more tangled up in the net's !!!
We had 2 opportunities to cool off in the sea. Once in the morning we swam in the clearest blue water onto a little cove to dry off before swimming back to the boat for refreshments and again before lunch we anchored at another stunning cove where Demetrios Mum showed us how to use the clay from the beach to have a clay body scrub ... Just fabulous !
Lunch was cooked and served by Efi on the boat . The fish caught in the morning was cooked to perfection the organic vegetables and salad all from Efi and Demetrios garden just delicious !! The wine served was another product of Efi and Demetrios making !!
The day was definitely the most memorable of our holiday and one that when we return to Katelios we will do again !
The only disappointing thing about this trip was that it ended too quickly and that Jame's (a fellow day tripper ) didn't catch any fish with his rod he had bought all the way from Scotland .. But at least Demetrios Dad got the use of the rod whilst we were swimming and the amazing man did catch a fish !!!

Unique trip with great company.
Thank you Efi, Demetrios , Demetrio's lovely parents and Mohammed !!",Date of experience: September 2016,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
