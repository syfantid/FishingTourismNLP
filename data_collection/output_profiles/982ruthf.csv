A magnificent tour!,"By far this was my favorite memory of my visit to Santorini. Anthi, our Captain, she is simple the best! She is passionate, she is knowledgeable, polite, friendly and treat you like family. Girl Power! Marcos and Muhammed the other members of this amazing crew complete the package. Is a ”truly hands-on” experience. My son an avid fisherman was so involved in the whole process, Marco and Muhammed allowed him to be an active partipant. I thought he was staying with them! Then, to top it all, the fresh sea food delicacies cook for you right on the boat. My family and I loved sharing our table at the Agean Sea with these wonderful people. A truly educational, cultural, relaxing and the most scrumptious gastronomic experience. I felt like part of an Anthony Bourdin show! Can’t wait to repeat it again.",Date of experience: June 2018,Giorgaros fishing tours Santorini,5,"Santorini, Greece"
"Best Paella, ate there two days in a row","We just finished eating at Colom for the second night in a row and our last night in Barcelona. Tried both the chicken and seafood paellas, excellent. Their Sangria is awesome too. Friendly staff. Great deal for family - combo apella and Tapas.",Date of visit: July 2018,Colom,5,"Barcelona, Spain"
