The dream day out!,"This trip was better than fantastic. We started at 8am with a very warm welcome from Efi & Dimitris with coffee and nibbles. We set off to start bringing in the fishing nets. It was so incredible and we caught a huge variety of fish. We were able to help the professionals and were educated well. We moved to an even more stunning location where we could snorkel in the turquoise water. The fish was prepared and cooked on board for our lunch. Efi is an inspirational woman. She grows and makes most of the produce we were given. Homemade lemonade & wine, gorgeous salads, and fresh fruits to snack on. The lunch was delicious and more types of fish to try than ever expected. Thank you for making our honeymoon so special.Ô∏è",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
