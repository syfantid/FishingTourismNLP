BEST Excursion ever! Highly Recommended!,"BEST Excursion ever! Highly Recommended!

Captain Gerasimos was hospitable, professional, informative, and a magnificent cook on the Poseidon! As we sailed the alluring waters of Lixouri with music playing in the background, Captain Gerasimos pointed out and elaborated on the magnificent sites along the way.

The boat was impeccably clean, and most of all held an inviting ambiance alongside the crystal clear turquoise water of the Ionian Sea. The Captain gave us the option of sitting in the sun or in the shade while heading to a flawless, secluded beach for swimming.

After our swim in the captivating waters of the Ionian Sea, we came back to the boat and our Amazing Captain Gerasimos greeted us back into the boat with exquisite hors-d'oeuvres and the best shrimp with pasta that we ever had!

My husband and I were hesitant to go on an all-day trip, but this excursion was not anything like any other excursion, the entire day was memorable from the point of when we met Captain Gerasimos to the point when we sailed back into the sunset.

Thank you Captain Gerasimos for an unforgettable experience in your boat Poseidon!

Till we meet again!
