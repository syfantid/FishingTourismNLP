"Great trip, excellent service!","I was on holiday in September 2019 with my 2 teenagers. My 14 y old son loves to fish here in Finland. He wanted to fishing also in Rhodes. Even though my girl and I are not interested of fishing, we had great time. We mostly enjoyed the sun and good food. The service was super-friendly, so I was not afraid to let my son go again alone to fishing trip without me. The crew were very kind to my son, even though he was afraid, how he would manage with his english. Everything went great. I hope weâ€™ll meet soon!",Date of experience: September 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
