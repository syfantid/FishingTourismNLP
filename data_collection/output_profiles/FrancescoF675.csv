Wonderful familiar Cruise in the south coast of Milos,"The cruise is an all day one starting from Paliochori Beach in the morning. We had a stop for a bath at least of 30 minutes in Tsigrado Beach, Gerontas Beach, Kleftiko Beach and Gerakas Beach. He made us to visit some caves along the path too. The captain sailed along the south coast trying to make us to see all wonderful water along the coast: he is very expert because he is a fisherman in Milos during the wintertime. We had a very long stop in Kleftiko Beach where he offered a delicious lunch composed of salads and pasta with fish. It's offering you all drinks for free anytime you would like, not only during the lunch: juices, beer, coke, water and so on.
The captain is VERY kind and funny, the boat is small so there are few tourists on board so the enviroment is very familiar. You can freely ask everything you need at the captain and he'll make the best to satisfy! The money is VERY well spent! I advice to sail with him because you will not be able to forget easily this ""familiar-cruise""!",Date of experience: August 2020,Explore Milos with Poseidon®,1,"Milos, Greece"
Must-try in Milos: very delicious Vulcanic lamb cooked for 48 hours,"Paliochori Beach is a geotermic beach so if you try to make an hole to put your beach umbrella you risk to burn your fingers :) In added, it's very hard to be so long seated onto a towel too.
This taverna uses to cook a lot of foods into the sand: I love lamb so I went twice there to eat the vulcanic lamb. Its taste is wonderful, delicious and this very particular cooking is very unique. We ate the vulcanic eggplant too: it was very good! Finally I had to ask for the free watermelon an the end of the lunch :) The price is just a bit expensive but your should evaluate that the lamb is cooked for 48 hour into the sand! :)",Date of visit: August 2020,Sirocco volcanic all day restaurant,1,"Milos, Greece"
A wonderful cruise around Poliegos,"First of all, Poliegos is the best isle among Milos, Kimolos and Poliegos itself so you must cruise there if you're visiting Kimolos or Milos. It is absolutely one of the best isle in Greece.
Now we're speaking about the cruise: small boat, kind captain and few tourists on board so the enviroment is very familiar. We were unlucky because the wind so we were not able to go all around the isle (for example we missed Ammoura Beach). The captain did not stop just in Blue Bay to have a bath there but in a beach very close where we had a ""long lunch"" there: in any case, he cruised into the Blue Bay to have some photos there like in Mersini Beach. The price is expensive but ONLY because ALL cruises leaving from Milos are VERY expensive: in any case, it is vey cheap compared with the other ones and compared with the quantity and the quality of the foods.
It's offering you all drinks for free anytime you would like: juices, beer, coke, water and so on. The lunch is spent with the goats: salads, variety of many goats cheeses, meats and fishes grilled just on the beach. The watermelon was delicious too. Every food (vegetables and fruits) are produced into the captain garden, so they are genuines too! He is giving you a gift for a couple: a little statue of the Venus of Milos",Date of experience: August 2020,Perseas Boat,1,"Milos, Greece"
"Crowded but absolutely not commercial: a delicious ""family-taverna""!","The taverna is the first one where I waited into the queue in Greece. Finally I can say the time spent worth to be spent for eating there and it is proved by the fact that I went twice there. Even it's so crowded, it is like a ""family-taverna""; they take care about everything: the waiters are kind, they ask you in a warm way if everything is going well or not, the menu is hand-written in all languages and every meal is well explained, all dishes (plates and glasses) are composed of ceramic like our grandmother's ones. Now about the food, the main one is the kid (little goat). Everything is very delicious: the goats cheeses, the meat cooked into the oven and the home-made pasta with kid too. The garden where the tables is nice. Absolutely one of the best tavernas in Milos",Date of visit: August 2020,Oh Hamos,1,"Milos, Greece"
Fresh & very delicious fish and very kind Innkeeper :),"The location is in the centre of Rodos town. Even it's located in front of a street, it has got a very kind terrace where to be at open air.
The dish that I advise is ""Tapas Sea Food for 2 persons"": surely the name of the taverna is ""tapas"" but they are giving you a lot of dishes but all of them are very BIG, delicious and fresh (not small like in Spain). You can check my photos too: he is giving you 2 sauces too, one it's the tzatziki.
We were for 2 dinners there and the first evening we ordered ""Day fish"" and ""Squid grill"" from the menu: they were VERY fresh and wonderful too! The innkeeper is very kind and talkative. It's cheap because you'll be able to have got a lot of fresh fish with that money to fill completely your stomach, even without bread: this one is grilled with oil too.",Date of visit: July 2020,Ouzokamomata Tapas,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Wonderful daily trip & very fun captain!,"A wonderful daily cruise because:

- you're going to one of the best beach at the north of Kerkyra: you can get there by boat or by a long treeking. It is Agios Stefanos Beach;
- you're visiting some wonderful caves near Krouzeri Beach having a bath too;
- relaxing onto Krouzeri Beach with a good green water for about one hour;
- The staff is very kind, easy-going and the captain is so crazy that he is always joking and entertaing all persons.

In added the price is not so high because:

- you've free drinks, beer exluded;
- they are picking up you from hotel and to come back too if you request without additional price;
- they are cooking a tasty typical greek meal on the best beach of the cruise.

I advice you to book very fast (by mail too) and in advantage for having a very good day in Kerkyra!",Date of experience: August 2018,Madalena Boat Trips,1,"Corfu, Greece"
One of my best daily cruises!,"I've travelled a lot through Greece and I had the opportunity to take part in a lot of daily cruises but this one is one of the best ones for different reasons:

- The number of persons is maximum about 30 persons so you can become familiar with all participants: now we’re keeping in touch with a couple known during this cruise
- The captain himself “choose” only easy-going persons to sail with him so in this way the fun is guaranteed
- The cruise stops 7 times in the best seas of Paxos and Antipaxos: you can go to some of them only by boat. For example, Tripitos arch, Galazio beach, Paxos blue caves, Rodovani beach, Vikra beach and Voutoumi beach
- During every stop, while you’re having a wonderful bath into the sea, the captain is always cooking for you: bruschetta with cheese and fresh tomatos, fruits, souvlaki (it has got a barbecue onto the boat), salads and so on. You can drink what you want (water, orange soda, coke, beer, ...), all included into the final price like having breakfast onto the boat. All foods are very delicious because he knows the right shops where to buy them ;)
- The captain is a very funny persons who is taking care of you entertaining all of participants during the trips, inciting to dance, to sing and to have wonderful time onto the boat
- The cruise starts in the morning and it ends in the late afternoon: it’s so long that you would like to go to bed early at the end of the day
- The captain missed to ask the money at the start of the cruise in the morning but everyone was happy to pay the price without a request of the captain when they came back
- Finally, the final price is VERY cheap too! What would you like more? ;)

Surely if I’m coming back to Gaios, I’ll try to travel with this cruise another time: the reservation book is full for at least 2-3 days before so go early to reserve your seats and have a wonderful time!",Date of experience: August 2018,Classic Cruises Gaios Paxos,1,"Paxos, Greece"
Good rooms and very good Location,"Very good location, staff kind, good cleaness, fridge into the room. The bathroom is clean. The rooms are just a bit small, the walls are too thin. There is the TV even we used it just a bit. I advice you to choose a room on the upper floor because the hotel is onto a busy street",Date of stay: January 2016,Hotel Mediterraneo,1,"Valencia, Spain"
A good Hotel,"It's the fifth times that I was there. Cleaness ok, chicken is in the avarage, not wonderful but absolutely not bad (rice is always good!). The wi-fi is not running in a good way but because a lot of persons connected in August. The problem is about the doors because when somebody closes one, its high noise can be heard completely into the entire floor and if you're sleeping, you'll be able to wake up.
The position is good to dance: beetween Ibiza Town (Pacha and Amnesia + Privilege bus connections) and Playa d'en Bossa (Ushuaia and Space). It's a bit more expensive than the other ones but it is worth to spend that ""added"" money.",Date of stay: August 2015,Hotel Ibiza Playa,1,"Ibiza, Spain"
Buoni Ziti & Buonissima Parmigiana,"Gli antipasti tipici napoletani erano molto buoni, sebbene il fritto non mi piaccia particolarmente. Erano rilevanti i ziti con sugo con manzo e ricotta di bufala e molto buona la parmigiana di melanzane. Da sottolineare la gentilezza del gestore del locale.",Date of visit: March 2015,Ristorante Salefino,1,"Milan, Italy"
Buone fettucce al pomodorino e stracciatella di bufala & fantastica parmigiana di melanzane,"Il personale è cordalissimo, l'ambiente un po' moderno ma ok. In cucina sembrava cucinare mia nonna o mia madre, ma c'era la suocera del gestore che praticamente era la stessa cosa. Erano buoni anche i rigatoni alla genovese e la torta con ricotta di bufala e cioccolato finale. Vi consiglio di visitarlo perchè ne vale davvero la pena! :)",Date of visit: November 2014,Ristorante Salefino,1,"Milan, Italy"
Good Starters & Coniglio alla Cacciatora & Wonderful Parmigiana,"The enviroment is very characteristic, you can see the kitchen from the table where you're eating without walls between you and it. You can eat some typical starters, a lot of them, even just a bit for each one. The Parmigiana was very wonderful and full of taste, like the Coniglio alla Cacciatora. The host is very kind.",Date of visit: September 2014,La Cantina Cosentina,1,"Cosenza, Italy"
"Good ""Spaghetti allo Scoglio"" & Prawn","I was in this elegant and calm restaurant for dinner. The waiter was very kind and the enviroment was good. I ate some ""Spaghetti allo Scoglio"" and some big prawns, both of them very delicious. The only negative aspect is that I waited for more than 30 minutes to receive my prawns but finally it does not matter. The dishes were well-filled",Date of visit: September 2014,Ristorante Hippocampus,1,"Cosenza, Italy"
Wonderful Goat!,"We took a greek salad (good) and papoutsakia (something like Moussaka, very deliciuos). Then we took the goat cooked into soup with spaghetti and potatoes into ourdish: the goat was very wonderful, included its sauce!! :) The staff was very kind about every our request and the prices normal, not high",Date of visit: August 2014,Eleni Taverna,1,"Lefkada, Greece"
Always broken Bathroom & Coakroaches everywhere: any staff support!,"I stayed 7 days at this hotel.

- the first day any water from toilette and I had to wait one day to repair it;
- from the second day the washbasin has used to lost a lot of water: I asked once without solution; they resolved after 4 days when I asked for the second time;
- I found an alive coakroache into the swimming pool's room near the kitchen, a lot of ones into the halls, 3 ones alive in my room and i had to use Insecticide to clean a bit my room

Finally when I sent a complaint, anybody answered my last mail.",Date of stay: July 2014,Hotel Playasol Maritimo,1,"Ibiza, Spain"
Molto Gentili,"Una pizzeria molto piccola sia per asporto che con tavoli con un'atmosfera molto familiare e cortese. Frequentata da familiglie, pulita e con pizza nella media",Date of visit: May 2014,Pizzeria Snuppi,1,"Milan, Italy"
The real family greek Cuisine,"We went there on Monday night for dinner. I ate a wonderful aubergine salad, some mizithra (typical cretan cheese) and some tzatziki (with a lot of garlic and surely hand-made) as starter. As main dish I ate Moussakà and a very good grilled swordfish. Finally I ate a yoghurt with some home-made fruits and certainly it did not seem like the normal industrial one.
The only problem is the menu becasue it is only in greek language but the owner is so kind to explain you everything. I advise you to go there to find the real family greek cuisine!!!",Date of visit: August 2013,Christianna Restaurant,1,"Crete, Greece"
Everything was wonderful!!,"I've travelled a lot in Greece but I've never eaten a just-cooked Moussaka, very tasty Saganaki, even I'd eaten a special kind of fried feta but it was a normal feta with a fried-egg contanier :) I tried there for the first time ""Bougiourdi me melitzana"", wonderful!!!! In added, they's got Amstel in bottle too!",Date of visit: April 2013,Rouga,1,"Thessaloniki, Greece"
