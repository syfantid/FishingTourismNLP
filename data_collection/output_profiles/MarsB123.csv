"Nice food, great service and live music.",Stopped here for dinner and a few drinks. Food was tasty and reasonably priced. We came back later as they have live music on every night after 9pm. Was a lovely way to spend an evening and would recommend if you are in the area.,Date of visit: November 2019,Enoteca Barberini,1,"Rome, Italy"
Avoid! Worst pizza in Rome!,"Stopped here for lunch after a busy morning sightseeing. I ordered a pizza San Danielle. It wasn't cheap and when it came it was basically a horrible margarita with a few bits of cold Parma ham thrown on. The pizza tasted as though it was a frozen one. The base was dry and flavourless. The other pizza we orderd was the same but with some cold bresaola and rocket on top. For 2 pizzas, 2 beers and a bottle of water it came to over 50â‚¬! The waiter was also quick to point out that didn't include his tip! Worst meal we had while in Rome.",Date of visit: November 2019,Il Miraggio,1,"Rome, Italy"
Best pizza we had while in Rome!,"Stopped for a quick lunch and to get out of the rain. The man who served us was great, happy to advise but not pushy. We tried two different pizzas, both were fantastic but the one with artichokes on it was outstanding. Very reasonably priced for the quality. Definitely recommend.",Date of visit: November 2019,Pinsitaly Trevi,1,"Rome, Italy"
Wonderful day out for all!,"Just returned from an amazing trip with the fishing tourism kefalonia crew. Cannot recommend highly enough! The hospitality was second to none and the lobster spaghetti was even better. One of the best meals I've ever eaten. If you are looking for an authentic day out with great food, great company and beautiful scenery then look no further. Hope we can return again in the future.",Date of experience: May 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Great location, clean, comfortable and dog-friendly!",Everything you could need for a comfortable stay. The property was spotless and obviously well looked after. All village amenities are within a short stroll. Loved Pittenweem and hope to return again soon. We would definitely book this property when we do.,Date of stay: April 2019,Sea Whisper- spacious home in charming fishing village,1,"Pittenweem, United Kingdom"
Fantastic Holiday!!,"We stayed here for a week in the middle of May with 2 young children and had a wonderful time. The accommodation has everything you could need and has the added benefit of having a full kitchen which is unusual for self catering in Greece. The pool area is spotlessly clean with plenty of loungers and umbrellas.The pool bar was fantastic with delicious food at a very reasonable price and Harry couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. The location itself is quite quiet but there are 3 good restaurants within easy walking distance and a fantastic local supermarket that has everything you could need. We were made to feel very welcome everywhere we went which is not always the case when travelling with toddlers! We found the Greek hospitality to be second to none, especially at Veramente Grill. This is a mountain village so, as you would expect, there are a few big hills to climb. The walk to the beach is lovely but the climb back up is not for those with mobility issues. There is a lovely restaurant right at the beach with is perfect for cold refreshments before tackling the climb! The owner of the supermarket did tell us there is a shuttle bus which runs to and from the beach but this was due to start the weekend after we left. If your looking for a quiet and relaxing break in the sun, this is the place for you. As others have said, if we had been staying longer we would have probably hired a car. There are so many beautiful parts of the island to explore.",Date of stay: May 2018,Trapezaki Village,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Greek hospitality at its best!,"Traditional Greek food which was delicious and very reasonably priced with lots to choose from. Everything we tried was delicious, and made all the better by the fantastic view out over the sea and to the northern tip of Zante. We were travelling with young children and could not have been made to feel more welcome. We tried all of the local restaurants and in our opinion, this is the best by far. Hope we can return again soon!",Date of visit: May 2018,Veramente Grill House,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
