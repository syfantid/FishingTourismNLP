Amazing,"It is really a nice day trip, we caught a lot of fishes and our Captain Dimitris is a very nice person and know everything about fishing.

Afterwards there is a restaurant will cook your fishes for free. It's the best fishing trip i have ever had.

See you next year Dimitris!",Date of experience: September 2016,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
