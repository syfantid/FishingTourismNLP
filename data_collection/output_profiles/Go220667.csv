very nice,"It was rainy day, there was a lot of people, but the staff was very friendly and try to organize all the hungry people all the tables and still follow the COVID situation rules. The staff was very nice, not too intrusive ,but with the normal level of kindness and hospitality. The food was great …we took “Bedančeva plošča” for three person and it was too much meat for four hungry adult persons. “Bedančeva plošča” is the plate full of very good mixes grilled meat which the chef Jaro is preparing. I really recommend this place to enjoy in lunch time and for sure I will be back",Date of visit: August 2020,Lačni Kekec,1,"Kranjska Gora, Slovenia"

Tbilisi city tour with nice local guide,"We decided to use the Tbilisi city evening walking tour with local guide Gvantsa. Gvantsa speaks perfect English and she knows a lot about the history in historical stories and funny stories about the city. The tour was great, not too long …the perfect evening walk with the local guide. Gvantsa gave us a lot of useful information about where to eat and how to spend the day in Tbilisi. She was very open if I can compare much more friendly as Sophie …but we were in contact with Sophie only by phone that is true.
