A perfect snorkeling,Really a nice experience! They are great! we did snorkeling and a very nice trip with the boat. Thanks a lot for the professionalism and the kindness.,Date of experience: August 2020,UP SALENTO DIVING,5,"Santa Cesarea Terme, Italy"
A perfect holiday,"The apartment is cosy and very well equipped. Raffaele and his wife really supportive and nice. We got fresh figs, tomatoes, olives and typical cakes during our stay. A perfect sea is just few hundred meters far away, and if you wish you have plenty of choices for daily trips by boat and renting boats. For every question on local facilities you have you will get an answer from Raffaele.",Date of stay: August 2020,Francis Vacanze Relax & Sun,5,"Santa Cesarea Terme, Italy"
Wonderful crew and delicious fresh food!,"The fishing experience was enriching and one-of-a-kind, and the crew members friendly and thoughtful (not to mention incredible cooks). We watched them fish, name, and clean all kinds of fish (we even caught an octopus!) and observed other kinds of marine life at the same time.

The route taken was varied and interesting, with some stunning waters, beaches, and volcanic rocks.

The food was freshly fished or taken from the Captain's garden, and tasted incredible! A truly personal experience that we doubt you would be able to find elsewhere.

This fishing tour is for people who enjoy eating fish, love the ocean water and want a truly Greek experience (and who want to taste the best fish broth they've ever had).

If someone has issues with fish bones, we would recommend they call in advance and let them know, so they can serve and prepare additional food, which is what they did for us, as they are very accomodating and kind.

Thank you Andreas, Andreas and Marios!",Date of experience: July 2019,Explore Milos with PoseidonÂ®,5,"Milos, Greece"
