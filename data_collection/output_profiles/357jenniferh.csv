Lovely,"Pleasant harbour with lots of shops nearby.

Full of history and things to see

Ideal starting point for a boat trip",Date of experience: September 2020,Mandraki Harbour,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Brilliant day out,"The only word to describe this trip is ‘fabulous’.

Great crew, lovely boat, everything provided.

Went on this trip as a group of 7 adults, holiday with our adult family. The delightful crew catered for everyone.

Starts with a sightseeing cruise along Rhodes town then off to fish for about an hour.

Once lunch is caught we were taken to a small bay for swimming and snorkelling while the crew cooked a scrumptious bbq.

5 hours of fun - would highly recommend this trip",Date of experience: September 2020,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"

Great food and friendly staff,"Delightful diner. The food and service were excellent.

Had breakfast and an evening meal here. Would highly recommend
Clean",Date of visit: November 2019,Grinder Restaurant,1,"Los Angeles, California"
Tired with poor service,"Stayed two nights pre cruise. Only needed the room to sleep in and shower they managed 50% providing you didn’t use the air conditioning as it was so noisy.

The tap on the shower was faulty it took two visits from maintenance to realise we could turn a tap on but no hot water came out. They offered us to move 3 floors on the morning we were leaving to shower!

Room itself was clean but the view obscured by filthy windows.

Really poor customer service when I asked to speak to a manager they said there wasn’t one but then large man who didn’t bother to introduce himself wearing a zip sweatshirt came and said nothing they could do and if I wanted to complain phone IHG!",Date of stay: November 2019,Crowne Plaza Los Angeles Harbor Hotel,1,"Los Angeles, California"
all top show,"Only here one night as part of a tour. Had a double room with comfortable beds. However the carpet was stained everywhere, especially in front of the mini bar, there were stained towels in the shower room and the corner shower unit was exceptionally small; everything steamed up like a sauna.
We had dinner, nothing special, tasty or above lukewarm, and breakfast, uncooked eggs where the white and yoke botb ran out of the shell. The hotel cats enjoyed it they were in the dining room waiting for scraps.
The general areas had worn carpets upstairs but a nice lobby area and staircase.
Needs further refurbishment and a good clean, stayed in better places.",Date of stay: December 2014,Lycus Beach Hotel,1,"Okurcalar, Turkey"
nice welcome to Turkey,"Lovely welcome at this hotel. The rooms were spacious and very clean. Lots of effort from the staff. The food was ok, typical of hotels in the region; not exactly hot and mainly chicken based.
Lovely outdoor areas, lift to man made beach and decking area, infinity pool looked lovely very clean all round.
Only here two nights but would be happy to spend a week or,two here.
Friendly staff",,Water Planet Hotel & Aquapark,1,"Okurcalar, Turkey"
fantastic,"Pick up direct from the hotel and taken to the launch site. Not quite,sure why we were locked in the minibus for half an hour before the flight but maybe safety reasons, who knows.
The trip was amazing, the pilot friendly and we felt totally safe. Beautiful and astounding views, like nothing on earth. Balloons everywhere so it's unlikely you won't get a place if you book last minute.
Beware if you are booking by card they add 10 Euro per person.
An experience not to be missed.",Date of experience: December 2014,Turkiye Balloons,1,"Avanos, Turkey"
lovely setting and ambience,"This was a delightful hotel with rooms set in the style of caves. Our double room was lovely, but a bit small, what else would you expect from a cave. The whole building was authentic and very welcoming; log fire in the bar area and cave rooms for the dining area.
The food was ok, not great, we had breakfast and dinner. The breakfasts were standard, nothing special. The evening meals were bland, hurried and served without a smile. Our coach party were the only guests and with very little effort the service could have been as magical as the building; we appears to be putting them out by expecting to sit and enjoy our meals at leisure, plates removed immediately and replaced with next course even if others at the table had not finished.
There are no lifts so ground floor rooms for those with mobility issues but you needed to go to the
basement for meals, down the winding stairs.
Overall we had an enjoyable stay but they could improve the service easily but didn't bother.",Date of stay: December 2014,Hotel Surban,1,"Urgup, Turkey"
Clean and pleasant,"We stayed one night during a tour from NY to Washington. Clean room with comfortable beds. We were on the first floor, couldn't see a lift so it was a bit of a struggle with our cases. This was part of th he package so don't know the cost but as the tour overall was really cheap think this must have been exceptional value for money",Date of stay: September 2014,Red Roof PLUS+ Washington DC - Oxon Hill,1,"Oxon Hill, Maryland"
recommend,"Delighted with this hotel. Friendly staff, very welcoming reception. The twin room was really clean, nicely set out and well equipped, only hotel during entire stay with complementary coffee in the room. Would recommend to anyone visiting Niagara Falls, a short drive away. The hotel has good amenities and free will go, another plus.",Date of stay: September 2014,The Buffalo Grand Hotel,1,"Buffalo, New York"
delighted,"First stay in NY and we were delighted with The Bentley. Very friendly staff on arrival, and throughout the stay. Lovely room with a view if the East river, Queensboro bridge and the cable cars. The twin room, 5th floor, was clean, spacious and comfortable. Short walk to the subway and about a 10 minute stroll from Bloomingdales. There is a roof top restaurant with lovely views across both Manhattan and Queens.

This was recommended to us by our travel company and we would highly recommend a stay here.",Date of stay: September 2014,The Bentley Hotel,1,"New York City, New York"
"total disappointment, unclean. Avoid","We arrived late in the evening to be given room 103. The Yale lock door should have given a clue to the quality. The toilet was blocked to bubbling over and the lights didn't work. Not the best start. We were moved to room 1005. A trip in the lift, with the damaged door and music blasting out brought us the room.
There would have been a lovely view of Manhattan had they cleaned the Windows and the bed was clean. There the good points stop
Never seem such an awful place. There was chewing gum ground in the carpet, broken furniture, mould, a bolted shut door to a crumbling balcony and inadequate lighting. It was awful. We did stay the night, having gone out for something to eat finding ""ladies of the night"" waiting outside we went down to 56th street for dinner, dreading having to return.
Once it was light we could see the full extent of this dreadful room. The CO2 emissions monitor was sealed up with duct tape, the corners and edges of the room hadn't seen a vacuum in years and the chair was stained with what looked like blood over the seat and back. WE MOVED OUT.
We didn't have a hotel to go to and needed to find one but anything was going to be an improvement. We did get a refund for our two unused nights but not until we had returned home.
Truly an awful experience. If we hadn't arrived at 9.30pm after driving from Niagara we wouldn't have stayed at all.",Date of stay: September 2014,Astor on the Park,1,"New York City, New York"
ideal location,"Clean, pleasant and friendly. Room was lovely, clean and spacious. Staff very friendly and helpful with really good local knowledge. New beds and pillows a huge improvement. Close to town and free parking.",Date of stay: March 2014,Travelodge Caernarfon Hotel,1,"Caernarfon, United Kingdom"
