Super trip - a must do.,"The early start ( actually not that early 8am) was more than compensated for by the experience of the day. Loads of fish caught of all varieties. We loved getting stuck in releasing the fish from the nets - sometimes finding it a challenge to untangle them - in contrast with Efthimia, who could always quickly work it out. They tasted fantastic barbecued or fried - Bream, Parrot fish and Red Mullet mainly, served with salads, potato salad and finished off with fruit. Great atmosphere.

We got to experience the Kefalonia shoreline and the crystal clear waters and to swim in lovely warm water at three locations. So much more rewarding than a simple “cruise”. The other party on the trip had been before, a ringing endorsement that we will repeat the next time we are in Kefalonia.",Date of experience: July 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
The most amazing mountain range in Africa,"We used Rwenzori Trekking Services, booking through Gane and Marshall. The organisation was faultless and everything ran like clockwork. I first dreamt of reaching the snowy peaks as a child, having seen the summits from Fort Portal and peering upwards through the car window winding around the northern flanks on route to Bundibugiyo. In 1985 I had the chance to get as far as Mutinda rock shelter as part of a 5-day Trek ascending the Nyamwamba and descending the Nyamugasani river valleys. Having climbed Kilimanjaro and Elgon in recent years I had an idea that this would be more strenuous. But I also knew it would be pretty spectacular. I expressed to my climbing buddy from the other trips that “this is the one!” - and so it proved. It is the most incredible mountain range I have been in. I am not a technical climber but there were some technical bits. These were perfectly and safely managed by the guides. Technical climbers could find some new routes and the rock is nice and grippy. It is not yet a rock climbers Mecca but it should be! The weather around Mutinda (3500m) seemed consistently drizzling but above 4000m it was dry and we summitted Mount Baker and then Mount Stanley with clear skies. Acclimatisation to the altitude is important and we were above 4000m for four days before climbing Mt Stanley. We were still breathless.

The vegetation zones are more defined than on Kilimanjaro, Kenya or Elgon and more luxuriant, taller and other worldly. This alone is a reason that this mountain range is a must do and should be on the usual published bucket lists. Saw a Rwenzori Turaco (another lifetime ambition of mine). The mountain ridges are jagged and steep and incredibly beautiful. The view of the peaks from Hunwick’s camp was wonderful. The air had that clarity of high altitude and there was complete silence. Unlike Kilimanjaro with its thousands of People we met only three other small groups. The Trek was every bit as organised as the Kilimanjaro climb and I suspect the mountaineering skills of the guides more developed.

We prepared by fellwalking in the Lake District where we live. Climbing the Rwenzori is not something to contemplate at short notice unless already pretty fit. The rewards in terms of the beauty of the climb, the interesting vegetation and the sense of achievement were for me worth every bit of the breathless experienced during the ascents or the preparation in the weeks / months leading up to the Trek.",Date of experience: June 2018,Mount Stanley,4,"Rwenzori Mountains National Park, Uganda"
Homely and very welcoming.,"Claire arranged a taxi from the airport as part of the tariff - so helpful after a long flight and arrival in the early hours of the morning. Comfortable beds with mosquito nets, a living room just like home, no traffic noise and waking to the dawn chorus of Woodland kingfisher, Hadada ibis, Ross's Turaco and Great Blue Turaco and an African Grey Parrot - all seen in the garden. Claire is attentive without being intrusive, supportive and helpful with advice around roads Her garden is beautiful and the veranda a lovely place to sit either at breakfast or in the evening. Lakeside restaurants within 5 minutes walk. We watched sunset over Lake Victoria - Tilapia, curry, burgers, and a range of vegetarian food on the menu. A Thai restaurant, popular and busy is opposite - both do take away that Claire can organise. I don't have to think about looking for anywhere else for our next trip.",Date of stay: May 2017,Colonial Residence,4,"Entebbe, Uganda"
Beautiful and Magical,"We spent three nights and four days on the mountain, ascending on the Sasa trail and descending via the Sipi trail. The start included a body boda ride for 7km up a road only passable by a 4x4 - yeehar, grinning from ear to ear. The climb is strenuous and the altitude left me breathless due to the ascent from 1770m to 3500m on day 1 and to 4321m on day 2. No headache. Day 3 involved a 37km traverse of the mountain between 3500 and 4000m. Scenically spectacular and the East African mountain vegetation zones amazing - more succulent than Mount Kenya or Kilimanjaro and every bit as strange and mysterious - it is another world and unlike any other group of mountains.
The trip was organised through Sipi River Lodge and went as smoothly as it could have with all like clockwork, coordinated by the Uganda Wildlfe Authority. For three hikers we had 4 porters, a cook and two guides - all were great and to be commended. We developed a close relationship with our guides Jacob Lotee and Karimu Namwendi. Both were cam and quietly authorative, able to chat and joke with us, great lads. We never felt rushed but this is a strenuous hike and to enjoy the experience fully you do need to be reasonably fit with good stamina. I wish I was a bit better acclimatised to the altitude.

Spectacular and Magical,"We spent 3 nights and 4 days on the mountain ascending on the Sasha river trail and descending via the Sipi trail. This is a strenuous and arduous trek forDay 1 started with a boda boda 7 km ride from Budadiri to the trail head, exciting in its own right along a rough dirt track, rutted and steep, an initial Trek through shambas to the rain forest and beyond. This was very strenuous going from 1770m to 3500m, without acclimatisation air hunger made us feel unfit, which we were not! Day 2 was to the Wagagai summit at 4321m in heathland vegetation: helichrysum, tree heather, lobelia and giant groundsel. Day 3, a traverse between 3500 and 4000m for 37km with the final descent on day 4 through all the vegetation zones.
The hike was arranged by Sipi River Lodge and coordinated by the Uganda Wlidlife Authority. For three hikers there were 4 porters, a cook and 2 guides - stipulated by the UWA. We developed a good relationship with our guides Jacob Lotee and Karimu Namwendi who were quietly authorative and with whom we shared stories and jokes. They are great lads and their presence added to the experience as they were knowledgeable and gave us a strong sense of security.
This is a Trek for those who are reasonably fit. Having previously climbed Kilimanjaro I would say it is more arduous and needs more stamina to fully enjoy the experience. The vegetation is unique to the East African mountains with the Ugandan mountains in my experience more succulent and exuberant. It is a fabulous experience and will draw me back.",Date of experience: May 2017,Mt. Elgon National Park,4,"Eastern Region, Uganda"
