"Fun, fishing and food","Really relaxed and friendly fishing trip along the coast of Rhodes with our two teenage daughters. The captain and his son (I think) were super friendly and couldn't do more for you. The fishing was fun but the highlight was jumping off the boat for a swim and the delicious food for tea. The boat had hand made individual tables for eating and drinking and food was served on a wooden board with salad in a shell. Plenty to drink and lovely company. The afternoon was great value for money and more importantly, a really happy memory. I'd totally recommend this crew.",Date of experience: July 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great community support- and great soup!,Thanks to Fiona and Mark for providing all 77 riders of the Tour de Catterline with some much needed soup after a tough charity bike ride. The soup was delicious and we enjoyed squeezing in together to get out of the rain. Especially good of the owners since the restaurant was full!,Date of visit: August 2017,The Creel Inn,4,"Catterline, United Kingdom"
Supporting local events - Tour de Catterline,"Thanks to Fiona and Marc at the Creel for the delicious soup and welcome to all weary cyclists returning from our annual charity cycle. It was a fun community event, with 68 riders and we raised Â£580 for Parkinson's UK. It was great that the Creel was able to support it.",Date of visit: September 2016,The Creel Inn,4,"Catterline, United Kingdom"
A little bit of peace,"I stayed here for a night following a business trip to London. It was such a pleasant change from the usual hotel rooms. Simply furnished room,nice NOT to have a TV, wonderful to look into the garden, fantastic to hear the birds - and all in busy east central London. Informative and friendly person on reception and a cool beer in the garden, what more could you want? Oh yes, a quiet room and comfy bed -sorted. Recommended, a gem of a place and only a 20 min walk from Brick Lane.",Date of stay: July 2013,The Royal Foundation of St Katharine,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Definitely stay here!,"Six of us stayed here on a weekend cycling trip. Comfortable rooms, great food and wonderful hospitality. Val and Mark attended to our every need, even lending me a pair of trainers to walk to the pub because my shoes were wet. Brilliant living room with giant tv for guests who want to chillax too. Thoroughly recommended.",Date of stay: June 2013,Glentorets Bed & Breakfast,4,"Tomintoul, United Kingdom"
