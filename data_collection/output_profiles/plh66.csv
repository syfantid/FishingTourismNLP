Absolute perfection!!,"Our family just spent 11 days at Grand Canada. The property is beautiful, the location perfect and every direction you look in is a postcard. Roxanne is a wonderful, helpful hostess and Assia, the beautiful housekeeper is the best. She took care of every detail, and more. I would very highly recommend this property,especially for a family or large group.

Amazing experience,"This was one of the highlights of our 10 day stay on Santoríni. The crew was beyond amazing and the food excellent. It was a windy day, so the crew took us in to calmer waters so we could spend a lot of time swimming. Highly recommend!,",Date of experience: July 2019,Private Catamaran Sailing in Santorini with BBQ Meal and Drinks,4,"Santorini, Greece"
The best of the best,"Our family of 7 ( with an 11 and 13 yo) had 3 days in Athens after 11 days on Santorini. We were all kind of concerned about spending 3 days in a van learning about the history of Greece. This was the best choice we could have made. George, our amazing driver and guide, is a former teacher, and he had an uncanny ability to keep us engaged. He is a walking encyclopedia of Greek mythology and Greek history. I wish I could have recorded every minute. I would highly recommend this group to see the city of Athens as well as the beautiful countryside outside of Athens.",Date of experience: August 2019,Private Greece Tours,4,"Athens, Greece"
Perfection,"This is a beautiful, centrally located hotel. Service was impeccable, food at roof top restaurant as fine as we have ever experienced.

excellent introduction and orientation toSantorini.,"This was a wonderful experience. We were beginning a 10 day stay on Santoríni and this tour was perfect to orient us to the island.

Best tennis facility anywhere,"After several decades of annual trips to the Phoenician, the tennis facility remains one of the best parts of the resort. It is beautifully designed and maintained and the staff, especially Belinda, the tennis shop manager, is so welcoming and accommodating.

Overall, the property is amazing. The guest rooms, however, are in great need of updating. They smell musty on entry and the furnishings feel and look very dated. For a property of this stature, attention needs to be paid to bringing the guest rooms up to a higher standard.

it remains a wonderful family vacation destination.",Date of stay: March 2015,"The Phoenician, A Luxury Collection Resort",4,"Scottsdale, Arizona"
Another sectacular week,"We have been coming to the Phoenician Resort for over 20 years and it never disappoints. We are residence owners and have the privilege of staying in the beautiful 2 and 3 BR villas. My husband is a tennis player and there are very few resorts anywhere that compares to this tennis facility. The tennis shop manager, Belinda, is always so friendly and helpful and always makes us feel so welcome. We look forward to our annual visits and hope that tennis remains a priority.",Date of stay: October 2014,"The Phoenician, A Luxury Collection Resort",4,"Scottsdale, Arizona"
Best day of our vacation,"Spent 6 fun-filled hours with Captain Smooth and Deon. We had 4 kids, aged 6-8, and they had a blast. Snorkeling, jumping off the water slide on the boat, searching for sea shells, and watching their Dad's dive for conch. Deon prepared fresh ceviche from the conch right on the boat- amazing. We are already planning our day with them for next year!!",Date of experience: June 2014,Blue Whale Tours & Excursions,4,Providenciales
Fabulous family vacation,"This was our first time to Beaches T&C and will not be our last. We took a family of 11 which included 4 kids, aged 6-8. The activities for the kids are non-stop and very well organized. The Kids Club is wonderful, run by the greatest staff who genuinely care about the kids having fun. We found the restaurants with a buffet were best for our aged kids, because table service was very slow. The staff was friendly and helpful, the accommodations (Key West & Italian village) were great. For a property this large, serving this many people, they do an amazing job. And it's all about the kids!! We are probably among the few who didn't care for Kimonos so much- very loud and only average food. Already booked for the next 2 years!!",Date of stay: June 2014,Beaches Turks & Caicos Resort Villages & Spa,4,Providenciales
"Perfect with a few ""growing pains""","Just got back from 10 amazing days at this beautiful resort and already thinking about a return trip. Most of the negative comments have some credibility but probably more a reflection of ones definition of ""perfection"". There are so many more positives that the weaknesses are easy to overlook and probably just some growing pains. There are a few things I would love to see improved. The restaurants are expensive but the portions are generous. There needs to be more diversity in the menus, especially for those of us who like to stay for more than a week. The menus at the three restaurants should be completely different from each other. The concierge quality must be more consistent and they must be available by phone- at least some of the time. I agree with the comments regarding the resort fee and the valet parking fee. We had a rental car and had no choice but to pay the daily valet fee, in spite of having the parking lot directly behind our room. I think it should be an option, not required.

All in all it was a wonderful week in a beautiful property with some of the friendliest, most caring and considerate staff we have ever encountered anywhere. Don't hesitate to check it out and you will not be disappointed.",Date of stay: January 2011,"The St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort, Puerto Rico",4,Puerto Rico
