Our First Family Fishing trip!,"What a great experience. So lovely to see Rhodes from the water, great fishing experience for all members of the family. Our 5+7 year old boys loved it. The guys on board were great, jumping in and helping out when our 5 year old started to get a little sad that he had not caught a fish and his brother had! He ended up with 3 fish and lots of nibbles!

Stopped off for some snorkelling and a delicious BBQ lunch, as others have said, it really is one of the nicest and will surely be the most memorable meal of our trip.

All in all, a fantastic trip and would highly recommend it.",Date of experience: August 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
