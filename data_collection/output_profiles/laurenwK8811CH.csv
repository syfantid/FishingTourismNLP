A perfect day on the Ionian Sea,"A fabulous day from beginning to end. Michalis and his family and crew are wonderful hosts, talented fishermen and even better cooks! It was a real treat watching the catch come in and then eating the freshest lobster possible. Delicious. Highly recommended. I would do it again tomorrow if I could!",Date of experience: July 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
