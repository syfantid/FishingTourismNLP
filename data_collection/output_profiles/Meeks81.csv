Amazing breath taking,"This is a must see...breath taking show. Put together fabulously. The show starts with s light show with water and then goes onto a laser show. The music is great also.

We only had drinks but the food served to other tables looked really good.

Sat in the middle we were able to see with no restrictions.

Photos don’t do this display justice.",Date of experience: August 2019,Magic Dancing Water Ticket Only - (from Protaras & Ayia Napa),4,"Protaras, Cyprus"
Fabulous boat trip,"Great crew, friendly welcome. Very informative information regarding the coast line.

Fab experience for all ages, a number of swim stops in the most beautiful clear waters.

Lunch can be bought on board which was a nice freshly made Sandwich and cold drinks.

Great value for money would highly recommend.",Date of experience: August 2019,Yellow Boat Cruises,4,"Protaras, Cyprus"
Very clean hotel and friendly staff,"We had a great all inclusive holiday. We were welcomed early hours of the morning with a packed lunch and were checked in very fast.

Rooms are very clean as is the rest of the hotel, rooms cleaned daily.

Food was always nice something for everyone, and well signed to what the dishes are. Very quick drinks service from the friendly staff.

Entertainment is ok probably catered more towards the younger guests.

Pool is big and for how busy it was didn’t feel over crowded.

Alcohol is local but was fine.

Hotel could do with some updating but then prices would increase.

Good value for money. Very close to 2 minute walk to bars and restaurants and 5 minutes to beach. Great location.",Date of stay: August 2019,Antigoni Hotel,4,"Protaras, Cyprus"
Tasty beautiful food,"I love this restaurant where do I start.., greeted by a friendly waiter who took us to our table.

The view across the beach is breathtaking and really worth the walk from Skala.

Our meals were beautiful with the produce either locally sourced or from there own land, which is an amazing unique touch and food is very fresh. We had the house wine which was lovely and reasonably priced.

A lovely gesture of the owner coming to shake our hands and a gift of hone grown grapes to take away with us was such a lovely gesture.

I will be returning when I next visit the island.",Date of visit: September 2019,Old Times,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Amazing experience A*,"If you are looking for a boat trip with a difference look no further. This is an amazing experience for all ages. It’s a great experience to learn how to haul fishing nets in and about the array of fish caught. The day started with the most amazing cookies and coffee and a very friendly welcome. Then it’s time to haul the nets, once all of the nets are in you stop of for a swim stop. while the fish are being cooked for lunch, which was amazing so tasty and the home brewed wine went down a treat. Information about the different spots/places on the way which is a really nice touch.

I really can’t rate this trip highly enough and if your wanting something different to the normal boat trips this is definitely for you.

We received a lovely welcome and they couldn’t do enough for you.

Will definitely be booking the trip again when we are back to this beautiful
Island.",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Amazing day out for all the family,"Had a great day out there's so much to do, animal shows including dolfines, birds of pray, seals and a pirate show. All really worth watching. Once you've Seen the shows there are water slides and pools as well as rides.

We only had one day here but could have easily have went another day. They offer a discount for a2nd day currently £8 Euro but to be used within 10 days. Really worth it if you can fit it in.

Prices for food and drink are reasonable and plenty of choices

One stop place for great entertainment and would highly recommend if your only going to do one excursion.",Date of experience: August 2017,Zoomarine Algarve,4,"Guia, Portugal"
Lovely hotel,Lovely hotel had a nice stay rooms of a good standard and clean. Staff in reception helpful. Pool area was disappointing due to problem with heating and hot tub and pool far to cold.

Amazing views,"The views are amazing from the restaurant 360 degree view, which are breath taking especially on a night with all the lights. The food wasn't as impressive and for the price I was disappointed and would recommend viewing from the bar which is only one level lower than the restaurant. But I would definitely put this in the to do list! Views alone are with the visit.",Date of experience: November 2016,Berliner Fernsehturm,4,"Berlin, Germany"

Amazing a must of your on the area,"I can't rate this restaurant enough. Amazing food which is explained where it was sourced locally, explained how it was cooked how long meet was rested etc. A choice out of 2 menus.

This was fine dining, glad we took the advise of only having a light snack through the day as you are served a lot of food.

Wine was also sourced locally from Sir Cliff Richards vineyard on the island.

Family run business so welcoming and all guests on 1st visit are asked to write in there book.

Spa weekend with the girls,"We had a great weekend spa treatment was so relaxing and facilities were good! Lovely views and walks around the hotel and golf course.

Staff were friendly and food was great.

The bed room was spacious with a walk in wardrobe.

If I have to have a negative was the rooms were far to hot due to weather and we could have done with air con or some kind of fan. But in reality for uk summers this isn't a major problem.",Date of stay: July 2016,Marine Hotel and Spa,4,"North Berwick, United Kingdom"
Visit up tiede,"We had an amazing time the views were fantastic and an added bonus the cable cars were on this time! Boom hour tickets with the rep for the cable cars you get to jump the very long line of people.... But you still have around a 30 minute wait! Really is worth a visit so educational for the kids.

Remember to have warm clothing it's freezing up there.",Date of experience: March 2016,Volcan El Teide,4,"Tenerife, Spain"
