Great Experience!!,"What a day!! My 21 year old daughter found Nikos online, what a great find!! Our family of 4 & a couple from Italy had an amazing day! Come hungry! Froso, Nikos wife is an amazing cook & there is plenty served! They tweak trip based on what makes sense that day & what the group wants to do. There’s other fishing trip options, that are bigger & more commercial...but for us this was perfect! Authentic, laid back & delicious!! A great way to see the island!!",Date of experience: June 2019,Milos Fishing Experience,5,"Milos, Greece"
Wonderful!!,"My family had the pleasure of staying at the Delmar for 4 nights this past June. Highly recommend! Location was fabulous! Walking distance to restaurants & shops in Pollonia. Iliana & Dimitra could not have been more accommodating! My daughter left one air pod & they happily mailed it to our next destination. We rented a car & traveled to the beautiful beaches. But we’re very happy we stayed in Pollonia & specifically at the Delmar! The two room suite was spacious & had a lovely outdoor patio. We ordered breakfast one morning, we ordered for two, which was more than enough for the four of us!",Date of stay: June 2019,Delmar Apartments & Suites,5,"Milos, Greece"

Fabulous Stay!,"My 14 year old daughter and I got a last minute reservation at the Lodge in the middle of August. What a delight!!! Marcello was a pleasure at the bar/restaurant, greeted us with a smile and was very informative on local info. The whole place was just renovated, so fresh and clean....fabulous furnishings with a mid century feel. We did take advantage of the bikes, and scooted around town. It is a bit further from the center of town than we expected, we didn't mind the walk or bike, but someone might. We ate at the restaurant a few times, limited menu, but food was delicious, there was a bit of a wait time, but in such a pleasant atmosphere and since we weren't in a rush it was fine. We would definitely go back!!",Date of stay: August 2013,The Lodge on the Cove,5,"Kennebunkport, Maine"
