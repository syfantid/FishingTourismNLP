I Would highly recommend it to everyone of all ages. From the minute you step on board the superb experience begins........  The hosts are very welcoming and professional; this is also an opportunity to learn a new skill and more about Samos sea life.  The delicious lunch, local wine, glorious scenery and views and the occasional sighting of dolphins all add to this amazing day out.  Diolch yn fawr (thank you very much) we will see you next year.

We can only recommend this excursion to others.  Yannis and Nancy give you a very nice welcome, they offer a great program, drinks, swimming and a great atmosphere.

The trip is amazing where you have time to learn and fish, and get the experience to eat delicious fresh fish after 1 hour. Nancy’s cooking is incredible, and will never forget “Nancy’s spagetthi”. The trip is for everyone and an awesome environment to swim in beautiful places and see the island from the sea. You’ll get a fun day with some lovely warm people, and definetely a trip you will remember for the rest of your life. If you are on Samos, you HAVE to go on this trip.…"
