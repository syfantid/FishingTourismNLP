Enjoyable seafood with friendly staff by the sea,After a long boat ride this was our first meal on the island. We decided to go there because of its great location right by the sea and close to the port. The staff were friendly and honest and provided us with the list of what is fresh and what frozen. Overall we had a nice experience with some great wine. The food could be better but it was not disappointing at all.,Date of visit: July 2019,Trapatselis,4,"Milos, Greece"
Cheap fast and efficient,After a long day at the beach and little money left to spend this was definitely the spot for my girlfriend and I! We both got stuffed and payed a whopping 11€ for 4 pita wraps (2 each)! This place was great for what it provided and I highly recommend it for cheap food that fills you up!,Date of visit: July 2019,O Gyros Tis Milou,4,"Milos, Greece"
Best ice cream on the island,We loved every flavor we tried in Aggeliki! The ice cream seemed homemade and the place itself is very cute and approachable! Highly recommend!,Date of visit: July 2019,Aggeliki,4,"Milos, Greece"
Friendly staff and fresh seafood,My girlfriend and I enjoyed a romantic dinner here with the freshest seafood that we were able to choose from their collection! The vibe was traditional and family like and the food was amazing! Our favorite was the fresh lobster pasta which was much cheaper than we anticipated at only 20€. We highly recommend this place!,Date of visit: July 2019,mikros Apoplous,4,"Milos, Greece"
Our favorite day in Milos,My girlfriend and I decided to give this a chance because of the family and traditional vibe it gave us! Captain K. and his daughter were the best hosts we could ask for and made us feel like locals on the island! We fished and cooked fresh fish while we cruised at the best hidden spots and all the big attractions! The 8 other people that were with us were all friendly and the whole group was united for a family style adventure! This is a 100% no brainer for anyone who wants to live the true Greek island experience while also getting to see the touristic attractions!,Date of experience: July 2019,Milos Fishing Trip,4,"Milos, Greece"
