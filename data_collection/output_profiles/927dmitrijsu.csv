Brilliant,"Amazing Fishing trip! It wasn't only about catching a trophy, that was romantic!! Even my girlfriend who hates fishing, and hates eating fish, was smiling the whole day, as she caught a lot, and had a nice meal with a beautiful sea view. Thank you. For that money HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",Date of experience: June 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
