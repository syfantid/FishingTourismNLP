It is absolutely one of the best isle in Greece.The cruise is an all day one starting from Pollonia Beach in the morning. We had a stop for a bath at least of 30 minutes in Kato Mersini Beach, Galazia Nera Beach (Blue Bay), another beach in the south coast where we had lunch and finally in another beach in the north coast of Poliegos. He made us to visit some caves along the path too. The captain sailed along the coast trying to make us to see all wonderful water along the coast: he is very expert because he is a fisherman in Milos during the wintertime. We were luckly because the wind, waves, sea and weather so we succedeed to go around completely in Poliegos. We visited also Epano Mersini Beach (Mersine Beach) and Ammoura Beach where is the lighthouse. We had a very long lunch stop where he offered a delicious lunch composed of salads and pasta with fish. It's offering you all drinks for free anytime you would like, not only during the lunch: juices, beer, coke, water and so on.  The captain is VERY kind and funny, the boat is small so there are few tourists on board so the enviroment is very familiar. You can freely ask everything you need at the captain and he'll make the best to satisfy! That money spent with the cruise are the BEST spent of your holiday there! ;) I advice to sail with him because you will not be able to forget easily this ""familiar-cruise"" because Poliegos and the captain Andreas!"

After swimming in the most incredible places, we had the perfect lunch, prepared by Andreas. We very much recommend his tours!"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J9379IAlisae,August 2020,5,Fabulous!!,We had such a wonderful time on this tour! Polyaigos was absolutely stunning and Andreas was was amazing!! He provided us with lots of snacks & refreshments and made us delicious seafood pasta for lunch. Would definitely recommend this trip!! 
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fanimator,August 2020,5,The best way to view Polyaigos,"The trip with with the boat was awesome. We made the tour around Polyaigos and visited the best parts of the island. The waters were so clear, i could see the bottom. We swam with the fish and saw sea turtles. We saw caves and beaches i have never seen on another island. The captain, Andreas was kind, funny and a great cook. He served us traditional delicacies and the best fish soup I have ever eaten. The meal was served onboard in a breath tanking cove at the southern part of Polyaigos. The whole experience was amazing. I will definitely take the tour again."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikolettav988,July 2020,5,Astonishing trip,"It was an amazing tour!  Mr Andreas is a great captain! We feel like we are still there, swimming in these crystal waters. The best moment was lunch!!! Captain Andreas was the chief fisherman and we tried to help him to catch fish and then we had a perfect meal with absolutely fresh fish. Almost forgot to mention the traditional treats we enjoyed, like ladenia and watermelon pie (DELICIOUS). Can't wait to visit Milos next year and of course our friend Mr Andreas!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lngts,June 2020,5,The best,"One of the best experiences in mylos island.We visited kleftiko beach,all the stuff was very kind.Mr Andreas was very helpful and he guide us in the best beaches of the island... "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nassosf2017,,5,Navigate around gorgeous Milos!!,"Chartered “Poseidon” as a family with our skipper, captain Andreas! Sailed from picturesque “Pollonia” in the morning, we spent the day touring the southern part of Milos, visiting spectacular beaches, most known the magical one, called “Kleftiko”!!Captain Andreas was a great companion and host making continuously sure that we have everything, from a tasty breakfast to a gourmet-style “fruit de mer” lunch (fresh shrimps, pasta dishes), cooled white wine, etc!!A relaxing and enjoyable day, the best way to explore Milos and see beaches that you can’t reach from land!!! Highly recommended!! "
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benschofield17,,4,Great way to explore Milos,"Having spent most of our time exploring the island via ATV (quad) and scooter we decided to set sail with Captain Andreas and Pedros (who were great!). The boat is small and there were only 7 of us on board (inc. crew) but it made the trip far more interesting than if you were on a boat of 40+. We visited 4 secluded parts of the island (that you can only access via boat) which were beautiful and, because of the pebbles/small rock beaches/coves, the water is so clean and transparent. True to their word food was served up and alcoholic/non-alcoholic drinks were provided (Andreas makes a mean spaghetti and shrimp pasta!). Thanks for the trip boys!! Here’s a few photos ;)"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8logan8,September 2019,5,Best day of our trip,"This was a fantastic day on a fishing boat, led by a great captain Andreas, who was capable and friendly.First we watched as they pulled in the net, filled with (delicious) fish we would later eat. Other very tasty Greek snacks were also provided.Followed by a tour of multiple islands, including the most amazing deserted beach.We are very happy we chose to go out with Poseideon! We highly recommend."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IleanaS861,August 2019,4,an unforgettable experience in Milos,"a wonderful experience - small boat for maximum 12 passengers, ideal for private travel,the 2 Andreas that make up the crew were wonderful - extremely friendly and helpful - they managed to make us a beautiful day - lunch was fished in front of us , they gave us more time where we wished even if that meant going beyond their program. & thanks Poseideon team!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlizaDom,August 2019,5,Fantastic!,"We had a wonderful time. We appreciated a schedule change to avoid bad weather as we were really excited about the trip. It was just the two of us and one family, so it felt very relaxed and private, unlike a party boat. We do recommend avoiding bringing small children. As others have said, the crew were very happy and helpful, and also flexible around our requests. The pace was relaxed but never dull, and we had plenty of stops for sightseeing and swimming. Fresh fish for lunch at sea is unforgettable. Overall a fantastic way to spend a day and see Milos, and it was also very reasonably priced. Absolutely recommend you do this while you stay in Milos!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teris1926,August 2019,5,Amazing,"The trip was amazing, beautiful palaces, delicious food and very friendly crew. I recommend it to everyone"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MancinPhil,August 2019,5,Makes sure you do this if you're in Pollonia !,"My wife and I travel many Greek Islands and always take boat tours. This by far was the best we ever did. This is for a several reasons. 1) It's a small boat so only a few other tourists will be with you on the boat, no party boat chaos. 2) The crew were happy, helpful and made us feel very welcome. 3) The route the boat takes is excellent, and many stops for swimming. 4) The atmosphere was never rushed. 5) The experience of seeing fisherman at work, and being able to participate in the experience was fantastic. 6) Actually eating the fish that you catch that day. 7) The price - very reasonable considering everything is provided and the meal is excellent.Some tips - 1) During the summer the winds can make the sea a little rough. My advice is call Andreas to discuss when the boat will go to Polyegos because this is the tour you must do to have the best experience from Pollonia. 2) As the boat is a fishing boat there is not much storage, so pack lightly for the trip, take just the basics (a towel and sun lotion is basically all you need). 3) Again it's a working fishing boat, so I do not recommend very young children for this trip. Ages 10 or over would be fine.Many thanks to Andreas, Andreas and Marios. It was brilliant. If you remember my wife was the opera singer who sang while she was putting the nets in the water :)"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/750johannac,,5,Awesome day boating in Milos ,"The best way to see the uninhabited island of poliegos, super authentic fisherman who started off picking up his nets and putting together the fish he caught in a pot for us to eat! He cooked the fish, set up a lunch with salad, fish soup and fresh fish! All served on the boat ! We saw the most beautiful beaches, swam in the most beautiful blue waters! The 2 crew members were super friendly and welcoming. A lovely experience, enjoyed by us as well as our children!Highly recommended! "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/h_konv571,,5,Great experience!,"We spent one full day with Andreas and Marios discovering the islands around Pollonia and loved it! The fishing experience at the beginning of the trip, the incredible food, the amazing spots for swimming and the very attentionate service all made this the highlight of our stay in Milos, for adults as well as for children."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alinalavinia_persa,August 2019,5,The Poseideon Adventure ,"If you want to feel the real greek ambience this is the right choice. The boat crew makes you feel the beauty of their sea and land. They make you feel part of the family as well, always being attentive with us, smiling always and make sure we feel good. The places they took us were just unbelievably precious and unforgettable. The captain is a really Poseidon! And the fished cooked there on the boat was the icing on the cake! Thank you very much Andreas, Andreas and Marios! You are special people.Alina & Antonio "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntonioS7302,August 2019,5,Trip to Polyaigos,"Totally recommended!!I had the pleasure to make the boat trip around polyaigos with them. We saw stunning beaches as we have never seen before. Moreover, the captain and Andreas were always looking after us and they were super nice. The fish was taken and cooked in front of us so more fresh than an ice cream. The food cooked was super tasty. Unbeatable experience. Regards from Spain and Italy."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V4229RR_,July 2019,5,The best boat trip !!,"It was w wonderful day. The fresh fish , the landscapes, the private beaches , the crew and the captain were excellent. We went to Poliegos a very beautiful island that the water and the beaches were from another planet. Thank you very much Andreas , Mario’s and Andreas"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matteotacconi,July 2019,5,Wonderful crew and delicious fresh food!,"The fishing experience was enriching and one-of-a-kind, and the crew members friendly and thoughtful (not to mention incredible cooks). We watched them fish, name, and clean all kinds of fish (we even caught an octopus!) and observed other kinds of marine life at the same time.The route taken was varied and interesting, with some stunning waters, beaches, and volcanic rocks.The food was freshly fished or taken from the Captain's garden, and tasted incredible! A truly personal experience that we doubt you would be able to find elsewhere.This fishing tour is for people who enjoy eating fish, love the ocean water and want a truly Greek experience (and who want to taste the best fish broth they've ever had).If someone has issues with fish bones, we would recommend they call in advance and let them know, so they can serve and prepare additional food, which is what they did for us, as they are very accomodating and kind.Thank you Andreas, Andreas and Marios!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jordanbR7566OG,,5,A very nice and relaxing day,Very relaxing day on the water and visited some beautiful spots. The fresh fish was delicous. The crew was very kind and helpful. Would definitely recommend this trip!
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/177eleanas,June 2019,5,A special trip with a real fishing boat,"A very special trip you won't get elsewhere. Many places do sailing trips but a real fishing boat experience is different. The captain was wonderful and we were treated to fresh fish soup (just amazing), food from his own veggie patch that his family made for us and the crystal clear, almost private coves of Polyaigos. We were picked up from Kimolos instead of Milos as that's where we were staying. Thank you so much to the team!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oriatlas,June 2019,5,recommended!,"We enjoyed very much.From 10 am to 17 pm. Sailing includes bathing breaks on beautiful beaches.  Beer, wine, pasta with shrimp and finally a sweet watermelon.  recommended!"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vagelisss,July 2019,5,A unique experience! MUST do it!,"We did this cruise a couple of days ago. All I can say is amazing! You start the cruise by collecting the fish net (actually cpt Andreas does it). Afterwards we went to the beautiful and almost “private” beaches of Poliaigos island which are really the highlight of the area in my opinion. We stopped at an amazing beach ,all by ourselves , to swim and afterwards have our lunch: the fresh fish we just cought ( “kakavia” a tradiftional Greek soup made of fish) and tasty home made “ladenia” - a traditional kind of pizza in Cyclades-by the captains mom. This was accompanied by salad made of tomatoes cucumbers and green peppers grown by the captains dad in milos! A really special and original meal! We stopped at several beaches of Poliaigos which are extremely beautiful and have the clearest water, astonishing landscape and all kinds of colors!At our final stop at pano Mersini beach we had home grown melon after our swim so that we would have the strength to “help” the captain throw his fishing net again in the sea :-) .Andreas the captain and his helper Andreas , made this experience so special and unique! One of the must do of milos and Kimolos! I highly recommend this!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3860CT_,June 2019,5,An amazing boat trip,"Andreas and Captain Andreas were extremely welcoming and made every effort to get us have a great time!They took us to the most gorgeous,isolated aquamarine waters where we swam and then ate delicious kakavia(the traditional fishermen's soup ),greek salad and sessional fruit as dessert prepared by them on the boat..of course using the fish just freshly caught..it was an unforgettable ,authentic and traditional fishing experience that we would highly recommend to everyone!We felt like we were at home, part of the family with them.Efkaristo poli, Andreas and Captain Andreas!"

We went snorkeling and swimming at hidden beaches and bays that can only be found by boat. We ate fresh prepared fish, fruits and vegetables from the guides own garden, got drinks and information as much as we wanted. Andreas and Marios did everything to individualize the journey for us and stopped at the beaches we asked them to. We recommend this boat tour for couples and families. The guides are caring and very hospitable. THANK YOU, Andreas and Marios! "
