HIGHLY RECOMMEND ZANTE FISHING TOURS,"Myself and my two brothers went on the all day traditional Greek fishing trip with captain Giorgos and his crew. The trip was throughly enjoyable and Giorgos was very informative. They really care about the environment and spoke passionately about the importance of sustainable fishing.
Hot and cold beverages were always available as were snacks. Lunch was plentiful and delicious.
I would highly recommend using Zante fishing tours.
Thank you Giorgos and crew for a fantastic day.

RIPPED OFF WITH THE PETROL FOR PRIVATE BOAT HIRE.,"Four of us hired a boat for the day. We enjoyed ourselves and the service was good until the end when it came to paying for the petrol. Upon boarding the boat we were provided 3 tanks of petrol each containing 30 litres in each one. We were told we would only pay for what we used. We used one full tank (30 litres) of fuel for the whole day, literally no more than 2 minutes away from dropping the boat back the first petrol tank ran out so we attached the second tank of petrol. When it came to paying the guy said we had used the 30 litres from the first tank plus 7 litres from the second tank. We knew this was rubbish as we had just attached the second tank, at the most we would of used one litre from it. Not wanting to cause a drama we just paid the amount asked but let the guy know we knew he was ripping us off. I donâ€™t normally leave bad reviews but thought maybe this will deter them from doing the same to other people.",Date of experience: September 2019,Abba Travel,2,"Zakynthos, Greece"
