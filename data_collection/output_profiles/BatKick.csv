Beautiful hotel in wonderful Kamari,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Boutique 28 for a week in July and absolutely loved our stay at this beautiful and relaxing hotel!

When we first arrived, we were a bit unhappy with the room as it was a lower level at the end of the row (where everyone walks) with not much privacy (I would have preferred a mid level room but maybe I should have requested this). However, we realised we would barely spend any time in the room other than sleeping and getting dressed, so this was not a big issue in the end. It was clean, tidy and a good size for two people. It was a perfect base: the bed was really comfortable, plenty of storage space and stayed cool in the day time because we were on the ground floor!

There were plenty of sunbeds for all guests but we were concerned about the number of sunbeds with umbrellas (only 5) which got taken up first thing and that the only other sunbeds were in the shade or full sun and were right next to what seemed a busy road. However, again we were surprised how quickly we zoned out the road (which wasn't even that busy or loud) and we never had a problem with sunbeds. The beds nearer the trees didn't get full sun until late morning/afternoon and you often found that the beds with umbrellas were free by the time this happened! Plus the floating beanbags were perfect if you wanted to lounge in the sun! It was perfect!! The hotel was full when we went so i imagine at quieter times, it's even easier to get beds.

The food and drink offered by the hotel. Although the breakfast was basic, I quite enjoyed it. There was a selection of hot food such as eggs, sausage and occasionally pancakes as well as pastries, cake, cereal and fruit! It wasn't fancy but I always looked forward to it! As for lunch, the food on offer was really tasty, especially the salads! There was a good selection of drinks including Alfa and wine! The Santorini wine was my favourite (and good measures too) and was only €4. Beer was €5 and some soft drinks were around €3.50 (which I thought was a bit expensive). This seems to be the same prices as all of Santorini/Kamari though!

Kamari is the perfect base for exploring the island and so many places to eat that it's difficult to choose! The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the main restaurant strip and not far from 3 convenience stores! I quite liked being a little further away as you are not on top of other hotels/apartments which much of Kamari seems to be. It's great that you're allowed to use the beach sunbeds at the sister hotel as well!

I feel like I've put a few negatives in my review but honestly I would not hesitate to return to Boutique 28, which is why I still gave it 5 stars. I don't see them as negatives as we had such an amazing time and had everything we needed. It's honestly the perfect hotel for a week in the sun relaxing and for exploring Santorini. I didn't want to leave...ever!!! The hotel is beautiful with perfect settings (the mountain view ) the staff are brilliant, ever so helpful and friendly all day long. You will not be disappointed!

So much love for this hotel & Kamari!",Date of stay: July 2019,Hotel 28,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Amazing pizzeria in Kamari,"We went here after hearing all the great things about it and specifically for a Greek Pizza (because why would you have any other in Greece) and it really didn't disappoint! Great dough, great homemade Santorinian sauce and perfect service to go with!

The staff were really friendly and attentive and the food came so quickly. The Greek salad was also tasty! My partner and I shared the pizza and the salad and we were so full afterwards. Would definitely recommend if you just want some cheap but extremely tasty eats in Kamari.",Date of visit: July 2019,Il Forno Pizza and Pasta,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Great hotel in the Jewish quarter close to ruin bars,"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel very much. The hotel is in a convenient location close to the ruin bars, plenty of restaurants nearby (including Karavan) and close to the sights. The room itself was very clean and tidy and didn't have a lot of noise from other rooms as others have stated. Although we had a room on the ground floor facing the courtyard. Loved the complimentary snacks and the facilities. The shower was great!! I loved the concept of an E hotel, it worked well for us. Just be careful if you're prone to running out of battery.

Breakfast was good! Mostly eggs, sausages, centrals and pastries plus ham/cheese and bread. As well as juices, coffee and a choice of tea. Simple but effective, especially after a few beers the night before.

The only reason I marked it as 4 stars was because the bathroom was just clear glass giving you no privacy. Not too much of a problem for a couple like us, but still a bit odd. I can't comment on other rooms though!",Date of stay: May 2019,KViHotel Budapest,4,"Budapest, Hungary"
Great if you like all inclusive,"We stayed here for 4 nights in November 2018 after having spent 3 nights in a Riad in central Marrakech. We decided we didn’t want to spend a whole week in Marrakech and thought we’d come here to relax after a few days.
The hotel is great for drinks and for relaxing by the pool, doing the occasional activity (which there are plenty of), if that’s your type of thing. Unfortunately we didn’t realise this was not what we wanted from a holiday until we experienced it. As the hotel is a way out from town, we felt restricted in our movements and had to go out on excursions only. This is just our experience though and nothing the hotel has done.
Generally the hotel is amazing and put a lot of thought into everything for its guests! We are not a fan of all inclusive dining as it was just too busy, however, there was plenty of choice for everyone, from Moroccan food, to fish, to pasta to cheese (Mmm the cheese) and I loved the different food stations each night (sushi night...yes!). The choice of drinks were amazing. The cocktails actually some of the best I’ve ever had at a hotel (and we went through them all in one night)!
The bedrooms were a decent size and the pools were amazing! The only thing that could be better is the gym (yes we are those people) as there just wasn’t the equipment.
We very much loved the welcome food/drinks on our first night, it was a lovely touch! Oh and the guy who plays keyboard in the bar is amazing!
I’d definitely recommend if you love all inclusive holidays!",Date of stay: November 2018,Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,4,"Marrakech, Morocco"
Wonderful hotel,"We stayed at Zoe’s back in June 2018 for a week and we absolutely loved it! Such a lovely hotel and the nicest owners who always made us feel at home.
The rooms are perfect and have a nice mountain, pool and sea view, which is the best of all worlds! The pool was a perfect size and plenty of sun beds for everyone. The food we ate at the hotel was beautiful (mostly lunch) although most evenings we took a walk into Faliraki for dinner. The walk is about 20-25 minutes but it’s pretty safe and probably helps you sober up a bit ;)
There are two lovely bays around 10-15 mins walk depending on whether you go left or right. We loved taking a walk to either side for drinks or some food. Our favourite was the pebble beach south of the hotel!
This hotel is perfect if you want a wonderful but cheap week in the sun and you don’t mind walking. For us, it was perfect!!",Date of stay: June 2018,Zoes Hotel,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Excellent and interesting tour of Lyon,My boyfriend and I visited Lyon last weekend and we joined the tour on Saturday morning with Paul. The tour was excellent and we enjoyed learning about the history of Lyon but also being shown around the city. Especially the Traboules as we probably wouldn’t have visited these if we weren’t on this tour. It was a great way to spend a couple of hours on our first morning and the pace was perfect!,Date of experience: February 2019,Free Tour Lyon,4,"Lyon, France"
Absolutely fantastic stay,"We stayed at the Riad for 3 nights at the beginning of November and cannot speak highly of this wonderful place.

The Riad is perfectly located in a quiet area of the Médina that isn’t too far from the main sights (15 mins to Jamal El-Fna square, 10 mins to back entry of the Souks (find the secret garden)) and is also easy to locate on arrival or even after a day of sightseeing. I would recommend ignoring google maps when trying to locate the Riad and other sights as it doesn’t pick up some side streets. Use an offline map as it’s more accurate (there’s a video on YouTube of the walk to the Riad which I watched beforehand because I’m sad ha). We also used the Riad’s taxi service which was very useful.

Inside the Riad, you will find a tranquil paradise with the most friendliest of owners who make you feel welcome from the moment you arrive. Thank you for everything you did for us during our stay.

The courtyard with the plunge pool is beautiful and I loved having a wonderful breakfast here every morning with the birds. Our room was perfect. We were on the ground floor in the smallest room (Dar Ilias) but it was perfect for the two of us. Plenty of space and a really comfortable bed! We really loved it! We spent a lot of time on the roof terrace as well and this was our favourite spot, especially under the colourful canopy. It’s a great place to just relax after a day touring the medina.

Staying at Riad Fleur D’Orient was the highlight of our holiday and we are so glad we spent time in the Medina here. We were so sad to leave the Riad to move on to an all inclusive hotel, something we do regret. Not that there was anything wrong with that, we just felt like we were at home in this beautiful Riad :)

PS we miss that cute cat that made the Riad her home whilst we were there.",Date of stay: November 2018,Riad Fleur D' Orient,4,"Marrakech, Morocco"
Amazing fishing trip,"We had done a lot of research on the best fishing trip and this one came up top, mostly because it involved cooking some of the fish as well, which we liked the idea of.

The trip completely exceeded our expectations. We had THE BEST day of the entire holiday!! Vasilli was a great teacher, really friendly, patient and helpful. We caught a fair few small fish (the rods are quite small) and had multiple chances to catch fish in different places.

After a good few hours fishing we went towards a lovely beach with beautiful clear water for a swimming break, followed by amazing barbequed fish including some of what we caught. The Greek salad was also the best I had in Rhodes. Absolutely loved it. In total we were there from 9 -2 and had an amazing morning! Well worth the money!",Date of experience: June 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Very good food,"Ordered from Epic Diner for the first time tonight and it did not disappoint. We ordered through just eat for collection and it was ready within 20 minutes. We ordered peri peri chicken which was lovely and hot, really enjoyed the chips too. I definitely recommended getting a mojito! Will be back again!",Date of visit: June 2018,Epic Diner,4,"Eastwood, United Kingdom"
"Tasty, tasty food","I really enjoyed my time eating at Wahaca. The food is excellent and the service is great too. Food was delivered to our table promptly.

Definitely worth a visit!",Date of visit: May 2016,Wahaca Manchester,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Recommended,"We were very pleased with our stay , the room was clean with modern facilities, the staff were friendly and helpful. Ideal and safe location with the metro nearby and close enough to walk into the centre along the Seine. Very satisfield with the accomodation and would recommend this Novotel to others.",Date of stay: April 2015,Novotel Paris Centre Bercy,4,"Paris, France"
Excellent,"Absolutely worth the visit, we didn't have to queue, but didn't manage to see everything as so much. Excellent organisation and friendly helpful staff",Date of experience: April 2015,Louvre Museum,4,"Paris, France"
"Amazing holiday, nowhere near as bad as people make out","My boyfriend & I recently stayed at the Tiran Island hotel for one week. We'd seen the reviews on here & expected the worst considering the reviews but were pleasantly surprised. So I felt like it needed a good review.
We loved the hotel! Even the food. There was plenty of choice morning, lunch & tea & it was tasty definitely not as bad as it had been described on here. I really don't see what the problems are as there was something different everyday & you have the choice of salads, fresh pasta, burgers, hotdogs, chicken, beef & fish meals but always different. It's just standard AI type food. Oh & the bread & cake were AMAZING! If you don't like something, there's always 2 other restaurants & a Mcdonalds to take advantage of.
The rooms were lovely. Really big with a private balcony. We'd asked for a sea view room with our booking & that's what we got. Due to it being quieter we felt like we had the whole hotel block to ourselves as we didn't meet another person in the area all week. The only thing I would say is that the room could do with having another light as it was a bit dim when getting ready.
The pool was fantastic. It was huge & there was plenty of room to swim. It was great how in 40 degree temperatures you could get in & it be the perfect temperatures, not cold at all. Loved the pool bar area too.
Drinks aren't the same as back home (though you can buy them), they taste different & are much stronger but there is plenty of choice. The beer was good, whiskey & rum was good but I didn't like vodka or gin so avoided those cocktails. I found out on the last day they do piña coladas which were good! The beach bar was pretty good too. All soft drinks are coke, sprite & fanta & juice which isn't bad really. We loved the piazza cafe in the evenings & the shipshape was great yo try. Cheap too.
Staff were brilliant. They worked so hard & were friendly everyday. They had lots of energy even after working 18 hour days. Our waiter was great (though we were sure of his name as his name badge had worn away), provided us with a table everyday, even set the table for us with drinks. Lovely man. All the cleaners said hello to us & made fantastic towel art. Entertainment was good too, join in if you want to but you font have to. It's always a good laugh!

Egypt itself is a beautiful place & we did lots of excursions whilst there as it was our first time in the country. We are so glad we stayed at the Tiran Island Hotel as it made it one of our best holidays ever. I would go back to this hotel as it's a nice area (not too touristy e.g. Shops/hassle), has a private beach with coral & it's quiet. Don't be put off by the negatives as people just expect everything perfect because they've paid for it. I felt compelled to write this review because it had been looked on so negatively. Just go & enjoy!",Date of stay: September 2013,Tiran Island Hotel,4,"Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt"
"Stick to what you know, can't go wrong","This is the first time I've stayed in a travelodge in Europe but have stayed plenty of times in the UK. The hotel was great exactly what you would expect from a travelodge (if not better, a bit cleaner in fact) basic but a good base for your trip. Had a few problems with the hotel key as the battery ran out & they had to recharge it which wasn't good after a long day site seeing. They sorted it after a while but the same happened again the next day but fixed it with no problems. They were very apologetic & I'm not a fussy person so didn't bother me really.
The hotel was in a good location to the main bit of barcelona in respect of getting to it. Not far from the metro & several shops around to serve your needs. I would say about 15 mins but for the price you can't go wrong. Location was a bit quiet at night but only because there is no one around, it feels safe enough though. Good distance from the beach too.
Staff were friendly. The hotel served a good range of food & drink too (my fave was the pint of sangria) & was quite reasonable, there were also plenty of vending machines too.
I would stay here again.",Date of stay: June 2013,Travelodge Barcelona Poblenou,4,"Barcelona, Spain"
"Visited twice, both times enjoyable!","Picked this hotel because of the location in respect of visiting central London & also because of the free car parking. I have been twice this year (feb & march) because I was impressed at such a nice hotel for a very reasonable price. Perfect for our needs.
The hotel is part of the pembury hotel (where you sign in) & is at the back of the hotel. From the outside, I admit it looks dated but its an old building but when you going the rooms, they are lovely. Yeah a bit basic but it's just a bed that's really needed & they are clean and comfortable. Had no problems with our stay either the.
Breakfast is basic continental but you can pay or a fry up so that's good. There is a counter selling other foods too (yummy cakes). The staff are friendly & the hotel s close to shops & the tube.

It's a good for value hotel that is a good stopping point for the centre of London. Will carry on returning to this hotel!",Date of stay: February 2013,Queens Drive Hotel,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Great holiday! No complaints!,"Me & my boyfriend visited Sunny Beach last September. We had a brilliant time. Didn't know what to expect from Bulgaria but overall we were impressed. Got to the hotel about 9, checked in quickly and then shown to our room. Both luggage was carried too! Our room was HUGE! Had a private balcony over looking the pool and it was very clean and perfect room temperature but could be altered. We were then allowed to go to the dining room and get some food. There was a shop around the corner too which was good.

Everything was sooooo cheap! Cigarettes were like 5 lev, alcohol was like 2 lev. And food around the area was also very cheap and you got some great deals. The main strip of sunny beach was a 10 minute walk from the hotel. But all shops are pretty much fakes but they're not bad tbh.

The food at the hotel was really good. Better than I had expected after reading reviews. There was always something to eat and I'm pretty fussy but there was lots of choice. Breakfast had both fried, cereal and fruit, even continental. Dinner and tea were similar foods but still nice, was so much choice you could choose differently each meal. Not bad at all for the amount of people they serve. The snack bar was also great.

Drinks were good. Nice to have cocktails, spirits, beer & wine as a choice. Service was brilliant too. But of course things do get a bit repetitive when having the same things. If you venture out of the hotel there are plenty of cheap drinks places even though its not the main area. Though don't ask for a strongbow as its expensive.

Beach wasn't far away and the pool was brilliant but a bit cold (they always are though). Okay once you'd got use to it. Plenty of sun beds and free use. Also a pool bar which was handy.

There is a handy bus stop that takes you to places like the waterpark or the towns that are good.

We loved this holiday. It was nice and relaxing but with plenty of other things to do. Was sad to leave. Would love to go back but need to explore the rest of the world first. Great for cheapness, drinks and fun times :)",Date of stay: September 2012,Laguna Park Hotel,4,"Sunny Beach, Bulgaria"
