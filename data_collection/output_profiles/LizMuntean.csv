Spectacular Wedding Day & Villa Stay,"After months of preparation with ourselves, Kostas and Annie we arrived in Kefalonia for our wedding on the beach followed by a meal at Andromeda. I have to say the day was amazing and thanks to Kostas and Annie went exceptionally smoothly, I would recommend these guys to everyone, they are lovely, friendly people and simply amazing and we can't thank them enough. The food and service at Andromeda is fantastic. We had the most special day.
We also stayed in the Andromeda villa which is amazing, fantastic pool, spacious and a very high standard throughout.
