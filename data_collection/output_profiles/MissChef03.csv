Perfect Fishing Day!,"I couldn’t think of a better way to spend a day on the water when visiting Kefalonia. My family stayed in Argostoli, so it was a short 18 min drive to the dock where the boat is. We brought our 4 year old and he had the best time. The food is absolutely incredible and seasoned to perfection.

Upon arrival we enjoyed piping hot Greek coffee and spectacular homemade cake made by Antonia the Captains wife. We headed out to see to retrieve the nets (took about 45 min more or less to get there) then the crew reales in the days catch. For us it was scorpion fish and lobsters. We also caught in the nets a piece of tile from a famous shipwreck from over a hundred years ago...very cool.

We then headed out a little further to drop anchor in crystal blue waters where the crew prepared the food while we took a dip in the ocean. For starters we enjoyed the Greek style bruschetta and salt cured tuna, followed by scorpion fish soup, lobster spaghetti and watermelon. There is also a plentiful amount of homemade white wine offered. I can’t say enough about the friendly crew. They were informative, helpful, friendly and best of all AMAZING cooks! The way to my heart for sure! They also provided a life jacket for my son and asked a day before if they needed to prepare any special food for him. He also got to wear the captains hat. It’s those details that prove they are top notch. I really feel like a have created a life long friendship with them. This is a must do excursion on your trip to Kefalonia.",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
