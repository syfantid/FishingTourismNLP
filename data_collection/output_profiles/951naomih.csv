Just......WOW!,"I had heard many good things about this place, so thought I should give it a try. Wow I was not disappointed......I had the whole hog roast bap & my partner had the vegan option, both were incredible as were the doughnuts we bought to follow. The owners were ultra friendly. Will definitely be returning.....regularly! Thanks guys.",Date of visit: September 2020,The Whole Hog,4,"Lyme Regis, United Kingdom"
Very friendly bar,A group of 12 of us came to Porto for a few days. Very happy we found this bar on our first day. The owner & the regular customers where all very friendly & fun. We were made to feel very welcome.,Date of visit: October 2019,Cheers Aquele Bar...,4,"Porto, Portugal"
Beautiful house,"We have just come back from a weeks family holiday....us, our two grown up children, their partners & my father in law. We were really pleased to all have lovely ensuite bedrooms & plenty of living & entertaining space. The views & location were great. Loads of long walks from our doorstep. Nice to get a phone call from Jaynee (hope I've got the name right) to check everything was ok. Also a lovely big enclosed garden which was great for our dog.",Date of stay: November 2018,"PENARVON HOUSE, luxury house, en-suites, games room, mooring available, in",4,"Helford, United Kingdom"
Perfect place for a proposal!,"Visited here a couple of times on our holiday. On the first visit we arrived shortly after they had stopped serving food, but they still sorted us out pasty & chips all round.On the second visit our daughters boyfriend decided to propose. The staff were lovely & even sent the young couple home with a bottle of fizz. Very nice food & atmosphere. Thank you guys.",Date of visit: November 2018,Shipwrights Arms,4,"Helston, United Kingdom"
Fantastic day out,"Just come back from a fantastic day out. Felt like a real family affair....Antonia was such a great host with a good sense of humour & very informative. Fascinating watching Cassan (probably spelt that wrong....sorry) bringing in the nets. We stopped by a lovely secluded beach where we could swim & snorkel whilst Cassan, Antonia & Michalis prepared our dinner, which was delicious....can't get any fresher.
Thank you to you all for making it a day to remember & hugs to Nikki who was adorable.....tell her to remember the stones!",Date of experience: September 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Perfect location, service & food","My husband & I had the most wonderful dinner here last night. The views were amazing, service was attentive, but not intrusive (Thank you Albion & Mortin). Our meals & drinks were beautifully presented & tasted gorgeous. Will definately return o our next visit to Southampton.",Date of visit: August 2018,HarBAR on 6th,4,"Southampton, United Kingdom"
