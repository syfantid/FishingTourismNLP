Three very happy campers!,"Three very happy campers! We’d eaten in the Waterfront before and been very disappointed with the food, wine and service - but not so here. The scallops were amazing, the calamari like none we’d tasted before and the oysters as fresh and tasty as you could wish. For mains we had yellow tail, prawns and lamb - all exquisite and faultless. And let’s not even talk about the desserts!! The wine too was great and the service fantastic. Come here - we’ll be returning for sure!",Date of visit: January 2020,Sevruga Restaurant,4,"Cape Town Central, South Africa"
Exquisite seafood,"Fabulous - exquisite seafood, stunning wines, attentive staff and great prices, in atmospheric surroundings - what more could you want?",Date of visit: January 2020,Beluga Restaurant,4,"Cape Town Central, South Africa"
A family affair,"My second time riding with Greg - this time with my teenage nieces. We had a lovely time, looked after by Greg, his girlfriend Katerina, his brother Adonis and his mother Tracey. We went on trek 2 and the views and whole experience were fantastic for all three of us. We were really impressed too by the obvious care Greg takes of his horses - and by the fact he went out of his way afterwards to return some things we’d left there. Thanks all of you.",Date of experience: July 2019,Gregs Spetses Horses,4,"Spetses, Greece"
Dinner to die for,"Just got back to our apartment after one of the best meals we’ve ever had - fabulous mezze of fish and vegetarian small plates, including the fantastic house salad and words-aren’t-enough sardines marinated in lemon, plus some outstanding prawns spaghetti - all wrapped up with a truly beautiful view and great service. Oh and the bill was a fraction of what you’d expect. Thank you.",Date of visit: July 2019,Patralis Psarotaverna,4,"Spetses, Greece"
Great day out on the sea,"My partner, mother and two nieces and I had a fabulous day out on the sea with Giannis - the food was amazing, the trip itself was fantastic and Giannis could not have been kinder or more attentive. We’d go again in a heartbeat.",Date of experience: July 2019,Poseidon Fishing Trips,4,"Poros, Greece"
Wonderful,"Fabulous Greek taverna as ever, with wonderful food, great ambience, attentive staff and the wonderful Giorgo, Giannis and the rest of the family. We’ve been three times now. A delight and highly recommended.",Date of visit: June 2018,Poseidon taverna,4,"Poros, Greece"

Faultless,"My friends and I love our food and we’ve eaten at some very good restaurants between us, but the food here is exceptional - particularly the turbot and the desserts - and the service fantastic. Well done all concerned.",Date of visit: December 2018,Restaurant Folium,4,"Birmingham, United Kingdom"

Little gem,"What a wonderful little boutique hotel in beautiful Spetses. Small but stylish rooms, fabulous breakfasts and attentive and helpful staff. This was our second time there - we’ll go again. Highly recommended.",Date of stay: June 2018,Armata Boutique Hotel,4,"Spetses, Greece"
Just great,"It’s hard to know what to say about this fabulous boutique hotel with its stylish and well appointed rooms, sea view (in our room at least) and balcony, great concierge, and fantastic location. We’d highly recommend this place and hope to come again soon.",Date of stay: July 2018,Dimitra Boutique Hotel,4,"Poros, Greece"
Excellent trek,"Had a wonderful time with Greg - a caring, knowledgeable and patient man with both his horses and his clients - and the scenery was wonderful. Highly recommended. Thanks Greg.",Date of experience: June 2018,Gregs Spetses Horses,4,"Spetses, Greece"
Fantastic,"Lorne and Jolene gave us a wonderful morning's snorkelling among beautiful corals and varied and amazing fish, including (southern - I think) stingrays and eagle rays, an eel, puffer fish, green turtles and a rather large loggerhead. Lorne and Jolene were really friendly and welcoming and took us away from the substantial crowds of other snorkellers, including some very large groups. A private trip is not a cheap option, but it is very much worth it. Thanks guys!",Date of experience: January 2016,Grumpy & Happy,4,"Ambergris Caye, Belize"
Fabulous,"What a wonderful, wonderful hotel - amazing staff, fabulous breakfast and one of the nicest rooms we've ever seen. The pictures from the management are an absolutely accurate representation. Not sure what else to say really, except thank you Cissus for a great start to our holiday!",Date of stay: December 2015,Cissus Boutique Hotel,4,"Antigua, Guatemala"
Luxury boutique hotel,"This sort of place would normally be well out of our price range, but as it was low season we got a good reduction on their rack rate and while it was still not cheap, it was absolutely worth it. The room was fabulous, and the bed probably the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The staff were great; the food and chef were fantastic; the views of the hill country were spectacular; and the pool (while small) was great too.",Date of stay: May 2013,Mount Havana,4,"Gampola, Sri Lanka"
"Good, clean, well run establishment","Stayed here for a night at either end of a fortnight's tour of Sri Lanka. It's only 20 mins from the airport and a short walk to the beach, bars and restaurants. It is clean, well run, with nice sized rooms with comfortable beds and impressive bathrooms - decent breakfasts too and kind and thoughtful staff. As such it would make an excellent place to stay either for those holidaying in Negombo or just looking for a place to stay or arrival / prior to departure.",Date of stay: May 2013,Villa Serenity,4,"Negombo, Sri Lanka"
Good food and atmosphere,"Excellent food, great service, good atmosphere - and generally good value (though not cheap). And while there was music playing in the background, it was unobtrusive and nothing like the heavy bass in other restaurants and bars nearby.",Date of visit: May 2013,Lords Restaurant Complex,4,"Negombo, Sri Lanka"
Wonderful,"Fabulous setting and fabulous staff. Highlights included the Dambulla pereheira, climbing Pidurangala, visiting the national park and a morning bird watching on the local lake. Thanks Thoseetha, Pathi, Gamini and Ananda for a memorable few days in your care.",Date of stay: May 2013,Back of Beyond Jungle Hideaway - Pidurangala,4,"Sigiriya, Sri Lanka"
