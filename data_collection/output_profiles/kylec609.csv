Highly Recommend for a day on the water,"My wife and I had a great time on a morning fishing trip with Giorgaros fishing. We were looking for an event to get out of town and also was a bit different than the typical tourist/romantic activity in Santorini. Fishing and eating fresh seafood was also something we wanted to do on the island so that was also a plus.

We had a great time fishing with our wonderful captain and her crew along with the other guests on the boat. Its a more casual boat and atmosphere but has enough creature comforts to satisfy everyone.

Safety is also a priority. The captain had postponed the trip a day due to weather conditions she saw as not ideal. While disappointed at first we realized that she took the trip's safety and satisfaction seriously. A trip the next day was an option so we got to go out then and had a great time.

The fishing is as much ""hands on"" as you'd like it to be but the crew does the bulk of the work. You're also allowed to hop in and swim at a certain point of the trip. Snorkeling is available.

The food cooked on the boat is great and fresh due to the recent catch. The Greek beer and wine that's included is also a nice touch.",,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Decent place to stay in Santa Marta,"I don't have any other experience in Santa Marta so I would rate this resort a solid 3.5 out of 5 stars. The bed and room are a bit lacking in comfort and updates but the hotel and grounds are fine. The location is great on the beach and pool is nice.

Breakfast is a good deal (I think it was included) and offers rotating regional options. I also really liked the mall next door for any last minute food or shopping needs. Helps to have something modern to hop in to while traveling for a few weeks.",Date of stay: September 2016,Hotel Tamaca Beach Resort,4,"Santa Marta, Colombia"
Great Tropical Beach,"We took a tour that was suggested from our hotel and it was probably the best way to visit Cristal Beach. We read that you 'could' take a taxi to Negujane but after seeing roads, park entrance, and boat service... it is much much easier to go with a guided tour. Being familiar with the park and fluent will help but if you want to not worry about those things, just book a tour to playa cristal. It helps to bring water and cash, I don't think anyone takes credit on the island. Snorkelling is a must, but from what I could tell, you have to rent the gear and go with a guide. So if you bring your own equipment, plan on paying for the guided snorkel area because they appear to frown on going in the coral area without a tour. The boat ride is about 10 minutes and easy and safe on our day.",Date of experience: September 2016,Cristal Beach,4,"Santa Marta, Colombia"
