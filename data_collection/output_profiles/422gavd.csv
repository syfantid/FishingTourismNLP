Hearty Portions & Good Atmosphere,"We (2 couples) ate here after it was suggested by out 'guide' on a golf buggy tour of Krakow. It is in the castle area of the city.
As many other reviewers comment, it has a traditional/quirky feel to it. Traditional(?) costumes for staff and a bit of live background music all added to the atmosphere, as did the general décor and feel of the place. It definitely doesn't take itself too seriously - and I mean that in a good way.
Meals were generally meat based and big portions. A couple of the dishes were real eye catchers - the kebab for example. It was basic and tasty with litre glasses of beer to quench your thirst. Good value, honest food.",Date of visit: February 2019,Pod Wawelem,4,"Krakow, Poland"
Slightly Underwhelmed,"We (2 couples) booked here for our 'get dressed for dinner' meal whilst visiting the lovely city of Krakow. We did so based on the amount of positive reviews and because to was quite close to our hotel.
On arrival, the place looked to have a lovely garden area (but it was February - so we didn't linger). We were warmly welcomed and shown to the table. It is a small restaurant over two floors with a nice feel. Staff were attentive throughout. We ordered starters and mains, but were told one starter (scallops) were not available for both people who wanted it. We drew straws and decided who got the seafood. We were then told that the one portion would have to come without the belly pork, but that extra scallops would be put on. We agreed. The scallops were tiny! Nothing like some of the pictures on here. Other starters were ok.
3 of us ordered steak & the other duck. All meals were warm at best - with one steak too cold for the person to enjoy.
All in all - perhaps because of our expectations (and the price compared to our other meals) - we were a bit deflated when we left.",Date of visit: February 2019,Zielona Kuchnia,4,"Krakow, Poland"
Great Location,"We (2 couples) are just back from a 4 night stay at the Amber Design Hotel. We had a lovely time, enhanced by this friendly hotel that is in a great location. We found it to be an ideal base to walk in to the city and enjoy all the sites and sounds (and tastes) Krakow had to offer. Not easy to locate - as there is no clear signage outside, but that wasn't a problem once we got our bearings.
The rooms were lovely for the price. Ample sized rooms, large and comfy beds, kettle etc, modern shower room. One minor point was we ended up with pillow cases with what looked like old lipstick stains on. Not the end of the world. We never ate there on an evening (it was very quiet - but it was February!), but the breakfasts were fine.
We booked in to the sauna and enjoyed a relaxing hour or so in there - make sure you put the relaxing CD on, rather than Polish 'talk radio'!
All in all, well worth the money.",Date of stay: February 2019,Hotel Amber Design,4,"Krakow, Poland"
Top Service,"After a bit of research, we decided to book a day seeing the Salt Mines & Auschwitz with Michal and his company, rather than a 'coach tour' with multiple hotel pick ups/drop offs. The price was very similar. It was a full day tour to both places, rather than doing each one separately. We also booked for our airport transfers. The service was great. Friendly and informative drivers who drove clean vehicles. Everything was clearly very organised for us. Tickets/entrance fees were all sorted. Highly recommended if you are planning a trip to either of these places. They also do many other tours as far as I am aware.
The rating for this is for the service provided by the company we booked with. I think the time spent at Auschwitz-Birkenau is a very personal thing and hard to comment on. The salt mines were spectacular, but perhaps a little long as regards the time it took. That could be because we tagged the two together however.",Date of experience: February 2019,Auschwitz Birkenau Museum and Salt Mine All Inclusive DAY TRIP with Local Guides,4,"Krakow, Poland"
Top notch day out,"Forget the big organised tours with a large boat crammed with tourists - if you want a bit of an insight into small scale local life combined with a relaxing day visiting beaches - loo no further than this trip.
We joined a small group of folk for the day, which began with coffee & a light breakfast. We were soon off & pulling in the nets - helping (if you wanted to) to untangle the assorted fish. We were surprised to be joined by a large eel almost immediately - but it was soon cast back overboard by Dimitri to hunt again. We caught mainly parrot fish in the 'big fish' net, with a wider selection, including several cuttlefish in the smaller fish net. We also threw back some interesting stuff, like rays and scorpion fish, before setting off for our first beach. On the way we stuck the boat's nose in a couple of caves - catching a nice view of a seal.
Once there, we enjoyed a relaxing swim, while Efi prepared dinner.
The meal was lovely. The fish we'd caught was supplemented by salads, potatoes and cold drinks.
The second beach we visited was a bit better for snorkelling and it also had a natural clay pit that we all used to cover ourselves in. Not sure what cleansing qualities it had - but it was good fun looking like a gargoyle for a while!
There was (I think) a third beach that we should've visited, but we stayed longer here as one of the youngsters in our party had been a little sea sick on the initial journey.
Besides the freshly caught fish, much of what we ate and drank had been grown and produced by our hosts, including the breakfast jam, salads and rose wine.
In summary, a memorable and worthwhile trip expertly hosted by local folk. Champion!",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
The friendliest bar in the village,"If, like us, you enjoy a drink or 2 before eating, look no further than here. Dimitri & Elizabeth were friendly, hospitable and engaging waiters - making us feel very welcome from the off. It had a happy hour until 20.30 - giving you a small saving on certain drinks. A wide range of cocktails were available & the wife did her best to work through the menu! After trying a little Greek, Dimitri took it upon himself to help me extend my vocab - but always in a fun and light hearted way.
Families were made very welcome, and the staff were constantly receiving cuddles from youngsters as they came in, left or passed by. We never ate there, as it seemed more of a snack bar type place rather than a restaurant, but folk seemed to be enjoying what they ate.
In summary, a great place to enjoy a cocktail/beer with attentive, friendly and fun loving staff.",Date of visit: August 2018,Nemesis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
A Great Place to Relax & Unwind,"Me & the wife enjoyed a relaxing two week break here recently. Our room was on the 'top' floor facing the pool/sea with a nice veranda that enjoyed the evening shade. The room was very nicely done out, with a four poster bed and plenty of room. The bathroom was also very clean and modern. There was a 'whirlpool' bath, but it wasn't working - not that we were bothered. More frustrating for us, was the lack of a hook or something to hold the shower head above your head - but we soon sussed out how to use the window to hold it!
The pool was lovely. Plenty of sunbeds and the odd hammock to relax in. The staff were (as you would expect in Greece) friendly and accommodating.
The food was always nice - although we never ate there in the evening - preferring instead to wander into the village via the 10 minute stroll for our evening meal. Everyone said the meals were very nice though.
All in all, a well maintained, friendly and relaxing little hotel.",Date of stay: August 2018,Pacifae Golden Village,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely way to spend a weekend.,"Thoroughly enjoyed a bank holiday weekend camping at this well maintained and friendly site.
Brilliant location in a decent village, just a couple of miles from the seaside villages of Runswick Bay and Staithes.
We used it as a base to do a bit of Cleveland Way walking and to chill out.
Two pubs (1 shut at the moment) and a butchers, plus the Runcible Spoon - a cafe/shop/pizza place. All good.
Clean and tidy site run by attentive and friendly owners.
Thoroughly recommended.",Date of stay: May 2018,Serenity Camping,4,"Hinderwell, United Kingdom"
Great value top notch meal,"Visited Kipling's for the first time in a while for a bit of a treat for our evening meal. And what a treat it was! We arrived early enough to choose from their 'early bird' menu, which has a wide range of starters, curries and sundries. I went for a chicken starter and a lamb main dish; neither of which I had tried before and they were beautiful. This opinion was echoed by my wife and son, who chose more traditional gayer. The portions were ample and the bill extremely reasonable considering the standard of meal - just over £40 for 3 of us including drinks.
We received a warm and friendly welcome from all staff as well as a little interesting background information about the curries available. Well worth a visit and we won't leave it as long before we're back!",Date of visit: September 2017,Kipling's Restaurant Sowerby Bridge,4,"Sowerby Bridge, United Kingdom"
Worth teh short taxi ride for good food n views.,"Nidri seems like a place where people return year on year. One such lady who we got friendly with recommended getting a taxi and trying this place out - so we did! The taxi from our hotel (Yannis at the quieter end of town) was 6 euros. On arrival we found the place packed with diners - many of which seemed Greek - a good sign we thought!! Luckily for us, a table became available right at the edge of the outdoor restaurant overlooking the bay. It is a brilliant view, up the hillside and overlooking Nidri, the harbour and the islands in the distance. The staff were - as you would expect in Greece - welcoming and friendly. We had olives, tzadziki and fried cheese for starters - lovely. The wife then went for lamb chops and I went for a more unusual offering in our experience - grilled liver and kidney. Both meals were bang on. Besides the view and great food, we also found this to be cheaper than the restaurants in Nidri, both for food and drinks. With hindsight, we may have been better asking our hotel to ring and reserve a table for us as we were lucky to sit where we did. Also, perhaps a trip earlier in the day, to get more daylight to enjoy the fab views. All in all, a great place to eat.",Date of visit: July 2017,Dimitris Taverna,4,"Lefkada, Greece"
Ideal Greek fast food place,"We used Stathis Place several times whilst we stayed in Nidri. It was very close to our hotel (Yannis). We arrived late on an evening and tried it to grab a quick meal, but our main visits were early afternoon. The place always seems busy - a good sign we think. We stuck to pork and chicken gyros in pitta. They are great value at 2 euros and there's plenty to put you on til your evening meal. The house wine was also cheap if you fancy a mid afternoon tipple - 2.50/3 euros for half a litre. They sell the gyros n kebabs in what they call 'portions' and you get loads. I would suggest a half portion (4 euros) is plenty, but it depends on your appetite I suppose. Ideal tasty fast food with good service.",Date of visit: July 2017,Stathis,4,"Lefkada, Greece"
A decent way to spend a couple of hours,"We walked to the waterfalls from Nidri. The route is signposted from the town and the walk takes about 45 minutes. On the way, we did get slightly confused part way - as we were both sure our tour rep said to 'turn right at the T-junction where there's no sign. We got to a T-junction and dithered because left felt like the right way to go. Eventually we went left and were proved right! After that it was all sign posted. The walk was all along roads that were mainly surrounded by olive trees. As you get there there's a lovely little tavern that we sat in after our look at the falls, as well as a stall selling products that are made from local honey. The falls themselves aren't that spectacular to be honest - except that they are actually there! You can paddle/swim if you fancy it, or just take a couple of pics and take the walk back. Like I said, not a bad way to stretch your legs and spend a couple of hours - but don't expect owt too spectacular when you get there.",Date of experience: July 2017,Nydri Waterfalls,4,"Lefkada, Greece"
Relaxing Day Trip,"Thankfully - after speaking to other folk in Nidri who had tried some of the larger boats for a day trip - we went for the Christina for our day out. They seem to have a limit of about 50 people, with each one getting a place to sit/lay. This is unlike the larger boats that pack several hundred people on!!
On arrival, the boat already looked full. A small family moved as we boarded and we bagged the place they left, which was right at the back of the boat. A Swedish lady then told us we had got the best place on the boat as they had done this trip for several years - 'back of the net' we thought!! A few minutes later however, a family of 4 arrived and we were asked to consider moving in order to accommodate the late arrivals - boooo we thought!! They took us to look at another place right at the front - which looked just as comfortable as the first place AND we could see where we were going - 'we shoot we score!!!!'
Once settled we relaxed and enjoyed the trip. To be fair, the trip was mainly travelling to places to have a swim, with a stop at a cave to take a photo - if you like pictures of big holes - and a trip to a village where there isn't really anything to do except have a drink. It was a very relaxing day though and me n the wife enjoyed the day. You get a nibble and a drink for breakfast and a lovely buffet lunch. There's a bar and they took orders once during the trip - although I think you could go to it whenever you wanted. They provided full face snorkel masks - which are miles better that the usual goggles and snorkel. The staff were friendly and you get the odd bit of information as you go round. Worth considering if you fancy an organised day out around the 'forgotten islands' of the area.",Date of experience: July 2017,Lefkada Forgotten Islands: Full-Day Cruise with Lunch,4,"Ionian Islands, Greece"
Yamas Yannis!,"We've just arrived home after relaxing and enjoyable two weeks at this clean, tidy and welcoming hotel. On arriving we were thrilled to find we had a second floor room overlooking the pool & harbour. What a view! The room itself was ample for our needs as our idea of self catering was limited to cutting up a tomato and opening a can of Mythos! It was clean and tidy - a lovely place to get out of the sun for an hour and watch the boats from the balcony.
The pool was clean and we never had any trouble finding a couple of sunbeds to laze around on. We found all staff friendly and welcoming. We didn't eat there too much, but everything we had was lovely. The price of drinks were about right for the town generally and the wife enjoyed the happy hour cocktails before wandering in to town. The location is ideal - placed at one end of the town. Nidri isn't a pretty town, but the views out to sea are great, with boats in the harbour and islands in the distance. There's a great selection of tavernas very close at hand. All in all - bang on!!!
Stuff we did - or didn't do:
We hired a little motor boat and spent a day travelling around. A lovely day relaxing, swimming/snorkelling and finding little bays to enjoy all to ourselves.
We had a day on an organised boat trip. We took the Christina and we're glad we did. A smaller boat than a couple of others available, with a guaranteed place to lay. Bigger boats crammed 100s of people on - we know one group who got off one of these part way round as they felt so cramped.
We took the ferry to Fiscado on Kefalonia. Lovely village, but the ferry to Vathi on Meganisi is cheaper, quicker and the village is very similar (we stopped there when we hired the motor boat), so with hindsight that would've been better.
We didn't have a go at any of the water sports - but there seemed lots to choose from.
We ate local and you're spoilt for choice - but one evening we took a short taxi ride to Dimitris which is up the hillside a bit. Lovely traditional place with fantastic views (if you get there in the light). Ask staff at the hotel & they'll book a taxi and even book you a table.
And speaking of eating, restaurants on the harbour side have a lovely outlook. We had great meals at Mama Mia (very close to the hotel), Apolen, El Greco, the Barrel and Basilico. We also had lovely meals on the 'main street' - where restaurants do not have the same sea view advantage. A small one very close to the hotel is Familia. It looks a bit like a café, but we received a very warm welcome and the food was beautiful. Trasta is also worth a dabble & is just opposite the hotel. Finally the unusual Ta Lalimia was great (once you get over the arrogant chef). No menu - just the price you're happy to pay for food and some information given about your preferences to the lovely waitress.
We were regular 'people watchers' at Ikaros. Enjoy an ouzo or a cocktail and watch the world go by for an hour. Very welcoming and hardworking staff.
We're pool not beach people, but we did have a lovely day on the pebble beach about 10 minutes walk away. Those beach shoe thingies help walking in & out of the sea.
We didn't hire a car and explore the other side of the island. Those who did felt this was a great way to spend a day or two discovering the beauty of the island. I would say a must if you are a beach person.
All in all we had a great time and would thoroughly recommend the resort and the hotel.",Date of stay: July 2017,Yannis Aparthotel,4,"Lefkada, Greece"
Beautiful food and a warm welcome.,"As one of the little restaurants who cannot compete with the harbour views that many take advantage of, this gem of a place is still worth a visit. We ate here twice. Our first visit saw us enjoy some prawns & mussels for starters, followed by seafood moussaka and fried anchovies. Lovely! We decided to revisit on our last night - this time ordering a few starters in a meze style. Dips, garlic prawns, spicy sardines, mussel saganaki and local sausage in a honey sauce. All great. A real family run feel and a friendly welcome - but mainly great Greek food.",Date of visit: July 2017,Familia Restaurant & Grill,4,"Lefkada, Greece"
Traditional Greek food and a warm welcome.,"We ate twice here during our stay, enjoying the meal both times. Located at the quieter end of town & overlooking the harbour, it is a lovely location. Our first meal saw us go for sterio-typical Greek: cheese saganaki and stuffed vine leaves followed by beef stefado & lamb kleftico. All very tasty. Our second visit was even better. The marinated anchovies were a lovely starter and beef stamnas was gorgeous, but the seafood linguini was the star of the show. Lots of the seafood came in the shell, including a small crab! As you would expect, the experience was enhanced by a very warm welcome by all staff.",Date of visit: July 2017,Mamma Mia,4,"Lefkada, Greece"
Our favourite people watching spot.,"We are just back from a lovely two weeks in Nidri. Ikaros quickly became a regular place for us to enjoy a cocktail or two whilst watching folk go about their business. From the start, we were made very welcome by the small team of hard working and friendly staff. The wife enjoyed several of their cocktails, whilst I sipped a few ouzos. We never tried the waffles, ice creams etc, but they looked bang on! A great place to enjoy relaxing.",Date of visit: July 2017,Ikaros Cafe,4,"Lefkada, Greece"
Lovely way to end the Summer,"Myself & the wife just spent 2 nights at Butt Farm over the first weekend of September. Unusually in our experience, there was no reception or official checking in, just a board with our name & plot number. Simple & effective!
Facilities: The site is small and self contained. There was a clean toilet/shower block and a utility room that had a couple of sinks for washing up as well as lots of useful information. There were maps to use which allowed you to enjoy the local countryside (and pubs!!) as well as an opportunity to buy/order fresh eggs and cakes.
Also on site was a large and well organised rubbish & recycling room as well as a dog washing facility.
A nice touch was the opportunity to book a fire pit for the evening. This was chargeable, but provided us with enough dry wood to see us through the evening, as well as a supply of marshmallows to toast.
Setting/Location: The site was easy to find and well placed for Beverley and the East coast. It is on a working farm and felt very rural, but it was only a short distance from main roads. The site is surrounded by cow fields and there's a small paddock on site that was the home for 3 sheep while we were there. For those who need to top up provisions, there's a large Morrison's just a couple of minutes away. We took the opportunity to follow one of their suggested circular walks that led to the village of Walkington, where we spent and enjoyable hour or so in the 3 pubs the village has. Definitely worth it - the walk and the pubs!!
We didn't do much more as we visited family on the East coast, but it seemed like an ideal base to do this.
Summary: Friendly owners, reasonable prices, lovely location & an ideal base. We would thoroughly recommend it.",Date of stay: September 2016,Butt Farm Caravan and Campsite,4,"Beverley, United Kingdom"
Super place to base our first visit to Liverpool,"Me and the wife spent two nights at this great little hotel and we had a very enjoyable stay. Here's a brief summary of stuff.
Welcome & staff. Having found the hotel easily using a sat nav, we were welcomed by friendly and helpful staff. Our car wouldn't fit in the car park, which is probably a bit small for the size of the place, but we were advised to park on the roadside, where it remained safely for the duration. The staff we encountered remained helpful and cheerful throughout, including advising us about eating out locally on our first night (ask about Lark Lane).
Room. We stayed on a ground floor room. It was lovely for the price we paid.
Food. Breakfast was bang on. Self service 'eat as much as you like' style. Worth every penny and available from 7 to 11. There is a restaurant opening soon, but we enjoy eating out and probably would've done that anyway.
Location. A short walk from Sefton Park, which was lovely for a wander to walk off breakfast. It was more than a walk away from the city centre, but a short taxi ride in cost us less than £4.
Summary. Great value, give it a go.",Date of stay: October 2015,The Mountford Hotel,4,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"
People Watching Paradisetourists,"We enjoyed a great couple of weeks in this lovely seaside village and Exodus became our regular drink stop. It enjoys a great location on the village square and we loved a chilled hour or so people watching while we enjoyed a tipple or two. Here's why we kept goin' back.
Location: Ideally placed on the village square. A busy place with both tourists and locals, and a warm, friendly atmosphere. We sat just inside the building so we got the benefit of the fans.
Grub: Not something we tried, but it looked nice when we saw others eating. It didn't feel traditional, which is what we go for.
Drinks: Bang on! We got great cocktails that the Mrs loved. My tip would be to go for ouzo. Well presented and great value.
Staff: Lovely people. We enjoyed their company, especially the lady who mixed the cocktails. If we sat for more than a drink, she would come out and chat, or give us an 'experimental' drink to give an opinion on. On our last night she made the effort to come and share a drink with us. The main man was also very charming and friendly.
Other stuff: great nibbles with the drinks. crisps, nuts and fresh fruit.
Overall, it is a lovely place to face outwards and watch people for an hour, while enjoying a cocktail and/or ouzo. Huzzah!",Date of visit: July 2015,Exodus,4,"Lesbos, Greece"
Our favourite place to eat in Skala Kallonis (and t'standards were high)!,"We had a relaxing holiday in the lovely sea side village of Skala Kellonis and ate 3 times at this lovely restaurant. Holidaying with my wife & teenage son, this was one of numerous restaurants we ate at. We never had a bad meal, but Ambrosia was our personal highlight.
Here's some comments about stuff.
Location: the restaurant is slightly off the village square, opposite the little church. We sat on the elevated side outside the main restaurant rather than on the tables directly outside the church. It was a lovely setting, lemon trees and subtle lighting with the church opposite was a relaxing way to enjoy good food.
Staff: They were ace. Friendly, respectful and accommodating. We got that everywhere however - it's a very friendly place. What they did do however is remember us! They spent time on our first visit chatting to us about the food, the village and stuff like the squash plant growing in the restaurant. We ordered salted sardines for the first time here. The waiter asked if we'd had them before, then asked for a sample for is to try. After enjoying the sample and ordering them, we were then told a little about how they might form part of a communal meal for locals. I can feel myself waffling, so I will stop by saying we had a third meal where we were offered 'our usual table' and made a real fuss of. They were bang on!
Drink: All you would expect. Their ouzo was nice and smooth and their house wine very reasonable. We enjoyed the chilled medium sweet red wine (dessert wine???) for a change as house wines tend to be dry.
Food: The main reason we liked it (well, well, well!!). We enjoyed everything we tried, so rather than bore you, here's a FEW highlights...
The first night saw me dabble with a beef Stefano. Beautiful! This was after enjoying the salted sardines (Greek sushi). The better half wanted to try lamb stamina, but they refused to serve it as it had not been cooking for long enough. So on the second visit the stamnas was the first thing we asked for. It was worth the wait. Gorgeous! On the third and final meal we asked for a mezze style meal that included plenty of seafood. Wow! More salted sardines, marinated anchovies (it has a name) octopus in vinegar, all beautiful.
Summary: We ate well wherever we went in Skala Kallonis, but Ambrosia just got the edge over some other very nice evening meals. Without patronising or pestering, staff made our visits feel special, but my God, the food!! Bang on!",Date of visit: July 2015,Ambrosia,4,"Lesbos, Greece"
A Relaxing Break in a Welcoming Resort,"We have just returned from a very relaxing beak at Kalloni Bay. Having read lots of reviews before and after booking we were looking forward to a quiet but friendly stay at this small hotel and we weren't disappointed.
We stayed for two weeks, flying from Manchester and after nearly missing the flight, we arrived late evening to the fastest check-in ever! We were just too late to get a meal in the restaurant, but they kindly rustled up some tasty left overs (then charged us full price) which we appreciated. Having eaten and reacquainted with my Greek mate Mythos, I settled in to enjoy a lovely break with my wife and teenage son. Here's a summary of 'stuff'...
ROOMS: Clean n basic. Ours were both on the ground floor at the front, which felt like a nicer location than the back rooms. Decent fridge and air conditioning. Plenty of wardrobe and cupboard space. Basic shower with olive oil soap n shower gel and towels. Our beds were singles pushed together, but I didn't mind sleeping on the crack if required!
POOL: Lovely and clean and plenty big enough. The pool itself was fairly deep, with just a small shallow end, but there was a nice kids pool too. Plenty of sun beds and parasols with very little pressure to claim your spot at stupid o-clock. The pool bar opened at 11ish and served all that you would expect. The freshly made orange juice was lovely. Dinner time snacks were ideal and reasonably priced. We enjoyed the salads and pizzas.
OTHER FACILITIES: There's free Wi-Fi, but only around the central area of the hotel. The grounds are small but nicely kept. There's a tennis court, but it looked past it's best.
BREAKFAST: Ample choice, nicely laid out buffet style, including a small selection of hot stuff (baked beans, bacon or sausage with omelette or fried eggs), fruit (the kiwi fruits were lovely), breads, cereals, continental stuff etc. The juice machine served luke warm weak juices, but that would be my only negative.
EVENING MEAL: Hard to comment except that it smelt lovely and people on half board seemed to like it. We went into the village to eat. It finished quite early for us (9pm).
BEACH: The hotel is virtually on the beach and provides free loungers for guests. We are pool people, so we didn't spend much time there, but we had a paddle (the bay is very shallow) and it was a bit see-weedy under foot for us.
STAFF: Friendly and helpful, without getting in your face or trying too hard to be your best mate. Exactly what we expected from previous reviews. Many multi task. A good example is the lad that runs the pool bar. If the pool is busy over dinner time, he gets run a bit ragged serving food, clearing up and running the bar - just relax and he'll get to you!
THE VILLAGE: Only a short walk away. A small working harbour and a village square with a fountain is just about all there is to it, but it's lovely. Often busy on an evening, both with tourists and locals, there's a lovely atmosphere around the place.
EATING OUT: Our highlight! The majority of restaurants are either around the square or overlooking the sea. We never had a bad meal, but our favourite place to eat was Ambrosia. Try the lamb stamnas or the Stefado if you enjoy a Greek stew, but whatever you do try the fish n seafood. Salted sardines (Greek sushi) and marinated anchovies, octopus in vinegar, the list goes on. Just beautiful. A close second for us was Caprice. We enjoyed their mezze 'set meals' -but make sure you ask what the actual dishes will be as they are subject to change. Our only mediocre meal was a pizza we got at Sampo. Lots of good reviews, but my son found it bland - it had no tomato base. There were two restaurants that you pass on the way in to the village - one called the Sea Horse - that we never tried. I could go on, but like I said, we never had a bad meal and they were all very reasonable in price.
DRINKING OUT: We enjoyed a cocktail, a beer or an ouzo at Exodus. It was great to 'people watch' on the square. Friendly staff and nibbles with each round! Sugar Bay on the harbour was also popular and similar.
TIPS: Get around the island in a car. The prices are reasonable, parking is free and there are no real excursions that grabbed our attention. There's some nicer beaches and quaint little villages. And if you do...
Spend a day in Molyvos. Very picturesque. Lovely views and great food (we enjoyed a mezze at the Captain's Table on the harbour). Boat trips seem to leave from here too.
Enjoy a quiet morning swim whilst swallows and house martin's swoop down for a drink.
An old chap turned up every other morning to sell his produce. Melon, bananas, nectarines, tomatoes etc. He speaks no English, but spend a couple of Euros and give him a bit of trade. The fruit I tried was lovely (and you can keep it in your fridge).
Be prepared to check in then leave the airport when leaving. If you get there in plenty of time, the tiny airport has little to offer, but there's a nice café just up the road!",Date of stay: July 2015,Kalloni Bay Hotel,4,"Lesbos, Greece"
