Amazing day trip,"I booked this excursion as a surprise for my husband and father. They had the most amazing day! We dropped them off just before 9AM and picked them up around 7PM. When we picked them up they couldn’t stop talking about how awesome everything was. They were super happy with what they caught and couldn’t stop commenting on how friendly and accommodating Nancy and Yanis had been, and Nancy’s is worthy of Michelin stat chefs :) They also went out to swim in a little bay with the most beautiful shades of blue they had ever seen. They went with a group of nine, mixed ages, nationalities, men and women and everyone seemed to have had a blast. They also caught so much fish we got to take some home for the next day. Don’t doubt it, you’ll have a great day out! We’ll be back and next time mum and I will join the fishing party:)",Date of experience: July 2020,Samos Fishing Trips,4,"Samos, Greece"
Fun afternoon out,"We decided on this activity super last minute and the company was super reactive via WhatsApp and got us on a canyoning tour for that same afternoon. Our guide was Nicolas, who took great care of us, all very safe but great fun too. I’d highly recommend this activity to anyone, as long as your moderately fit and are a good swimmer. Probably more of a children over twelve years old activity.",Date of experience: August 2019,Azur Canyoning,4,"Nice, France"
Latte Art - Fun yet Informative,"We attended a private latte art class last Friday as our busy work schedule clashed with the regular classes. Thank you again for arranging this around our schedule! The class was 3h, to the point and very informative. We must have made at least 30 something coffees each, practising over and over again. I really enjoyed being able to practice so much as it's definitely a skill that doesn't come natural to us, haha! I would love to attend the academy again and would recommend it to anyone. The teacher was very patient and her english was great! Thanks again!",Date of experience: June 2019,Espresso Academy,4,"Florence, Italy"
Wonderful cookery week with chef Tan,"Excellently organised, from the pick up at the airport, the one week cookery course, the accommodation, the excursions to the cu chi tunnels and the Mekong delta. Love the whole team at the school, special credit to Victor. Cooking courses are intensive but you never feel rushed whilst learning so much at the same time. Would highly recommend to anyone. It's a fair ride from Saigon but so worth it. Don't hesitate, go!",Date of experience: August 2017,HCM Cooking Class,4,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"
