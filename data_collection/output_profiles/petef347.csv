Best in the cities,"Can’t top this place :)
Best service and steaks in the city
Porter house with some scallop benedict, broccoloni and an old fashioned and it cany get any better!!",Date of visit: December 2018,Manny's Steakhouse,1,"Minneapolis, Minnesota"
Loved it!,"Had been recommended this spot by a few people, definitely worth it! The drinks are huge and the vibe is friendly and free flowing. The burritos were just big enough and for 2 people 2 drinks and 2 burritos was around 20 USD. Will stop by again!!!",Date of visit: April 2019,Burrito Amor,1,"Tulum, Mexico"
Inconsistent,"Was recommended to grab a drink at Azulik, ended up getting their a bit later than I wanted to so was closing in on dinner time. The gentleman informed me that I would be able to get a drink but had to stand in my designated area and that I was not allowed near the “ restaurant” totally fine, but I also was curious about the hotel and he quickly shot me down or even pointed me towards he front desk. Doesn’t seem like that they are trying to provide a good customer experience. Ate and got a day bed at BE TULUM and they were very smiley and welcoming. Not the same feeling at all. Coming from both New York and LA, not a good way to leave a first impression. ALSO he made sure to mention they had a lot of “ vips” I wasn’t aware that he new what I did for work or my bank statement, because I at first wanted to book azulik but ended up going closer towards gitano. Always room for improvement :)",Date of stay: April 2019,AZULIK Tulum,1,"Tulum, Mexico"
"Really nice staff, wish I could give them 5 stars","Checked into “Be My Guest” for one night on the way back from Mykonos. Host and staff were extremely nice, breakfast in the morning was good and they had a variety of coffee and juice. Only problem was the room overall looked clean but the sheets were stained and woke-up with bug bites all over my legs, feet, and hands. I think someone had bedbugs and the hotel either didn’t notice or couldn’t get rid of them. Overall, was a nice stay, but cleanliness is cleanliness",Date of stay: May 2018,Be My Guest Athens,1,"Athens, Greece"
Hotel under construction,"Hotel was under construction and nobody informed us. Their was also another couple waiting at the gates, they were not informed either. Had a party of 6 people with me. Had to take 2 cabs 3 different times until we finally got to the new hotel that we had to rebook ourselves. Just an unorganized company, don’t feel comfortable giving them my business or money if you can’t inform me that my reservation will be changed.",Date of stay: May 2018,Villa Thea Mykonos-Luxury Villa with Private Pool,1,"Mykonos, Greece"
**AMAZING OASIS **,"We had a total of 6 guests staying and all I can say is that it was amazing!! Exceeded any of our expectations, and the pictures don’t do the property justice on how beautiful it is. The interior is decorated beautifully with two custom kitchens and two spacious living rooms, and four bedrooms. The host of the property was Pari and her parents stopped by also to help and say hello. Pari and her family go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and they are just generally all around good people! They made our stay even better than it already was. Their are also peacocks on the property and chickens, as a parting gift Pari gave us some feathers as a take away from the property. I WILL be coming back to this property as often as I can with friend and family! I HIGHLY recommend this, you feel have the best seat in Naxos!",Date of stay: May 2018,Villa Pari Manda,1,"Naxos, Greece"
"Host was Nice, hotel under construction and didn’t inform.","I booked this villa 3 months ago, was super excited to stay here, showed all my guests who were staying and they were excited. Upon arrival the gate was closed and the entire villa was under construction. Nobody informed me about this, and booking.com blamed the villa and vice versa. The gentleman who took us to a cafe to help us out was extremely nice, but someone dropped the ball somewhere and that’s not how you treat people who are spending thousand of dollars at your property. I come to Mykonos every year and this was the first with a big group, I won’t be booking any Villa Thea Collections in the future at all.",Date of stay: May 2018,Villa Thea Collection Mykonos,1,"Mykonos, Greece"
Hidden Gem on the cliffs of Santorini,"Just left this place after staying for two days, all I can say is that the view says it all. The staff was so friendly and accommodating, and made sure that where we needed to go and at what time. The rooms are super spacious and are almost like little caves in the side of the cliff, and most rooms have a kitchen with refrigerator, small eating table and plenty of extra sleeping and resting areas. This hotel is super close to tons of amazing restaurants and the staff is really
Good at recommending things to do. Breakfast is either delivered to your room upon request or waiting for you on the terrace overlooking the sea and cliffs.

This hotel gets an A+ because they let us hangout the day we checked out until 8pm because our flight got pushed back, all in all it was a great experience !!!",Date of stay: September 2017,Cori Rigas Suites,1,"Santorini, Greece"
AMAZING costal views and HIGHLIGHT of our stay in Santorini!,"Before coming to Santorini I was dead set on fishing, after the chaos of planning and traveling I forgot to solidify a spot on this tour. Long story short I was connected by a third party to Giorgaros fishing. Some advice I can give is plan before arriving in Santorini, and also give the business a few days to respond because they definitely will!

Anthi was the captain of boat and she made out your what it was, amazing! Their is a small van that is provided by the company that picks you up right outside of
your hotel (which is awesome) and they take you towards Kalami beach and to the port where all fishing and yachting boats are. Our trip was about 5-6 hours and the price was unbeatable. Anthi explained a lot about the history of her family on the island and the fishing boat we would be going on.

We pulled shrimp nets up first and probably caught about 13 dozen shrimp.
We then drove to where the fishing nets were, we caught about 80-100 different fish!!!!!! 9 different species, some squid, some snails and hermit crabs were on the net too. I was in shock of how much fish we pulled up, I really was hoping to catch an octopus but catching a squid was just as satisfying.

The crew, who was two other guys, were awesome as well... they cooked the fish on the grill, deep friend some and deep friend the shrimp. I forgot to mention this but when you get on the boat they have wines, beers, water and soda prepared already that you can grab at will throughout the trip.

Overall we fished, grilled, laughed, and even swam right off the shores of the beach. I will definitely be back to catch an octopus next year!!! This fishing trip made my vacation and I was so glad it was Giorgaros, and that Anthi was the captain!",Date of experience: September 2017,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,1,"Santorini, Greece"
