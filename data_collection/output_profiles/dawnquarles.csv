Best hotel from five we stayed in while in Malaysia.,"We were walk-in customers looking for a better room than what we were staying in at the time (at another hotel), and were immediately greeted by Mohamed and his kind staff at RC, who offered us a terrific rate and worked with us on the length of the rest of our stay. He could not have been more helpful or accommodating. A few days later when we finally checked in to RC, our stay in Langkawi got much better.

The room was very nice, and the bathroom in particular was quite an upgrade from what we had experienced before. It is a new property, so the beds are very comfortable. The pillows are decadent and the linens are plentiful. The room is serviced every single day. The pool area is delightful and we were lucky enough to spot a family of black monkeys in the trees nearby one day when we were out there.

The only negatives were that there are a few 6-person suites with small private pools on the property, and we had the misfortune of having one of those booked right across from our room...this meant their large party had many loud late night conversations and there were early morning pool sessions for their kids...not something we enjoyed very much. Other than that, we were in heaven.

In Langkawi, for a very reasonable rate, you can stay in a very nice hotel if you choose the Royale Chenang. We will miss them.",Date of stay: July 2019,Royale Chenang Resort,4,"Langkawi, Malaysia"
Blue hole snorkeling.,"Amazing diving and snorkeling, if you can tolerate the millions of people and the dirty restaurants. It’s too bad this breathtaking place is so overrun with kids and people who can’t swim well.",Date of experience: June 2019,Blue Hole,4,"Dahab, Egypt"
Eid vacation,"This was a great weekend away to Dahab with a few girlfriends. L.A. is a dive resort, so there were no children staying there.... a definite plus. Divers were gone all day and went to bed early so the place is almost always quiet and peaceful. The homemade breakfast each morning was the greatest perk of the entire trip, and it was included in the room rate. And, it was hands down the best food we ate all week. The site is new, and beautifully outfitted for people who want to relax. The rooms were immaculate and the beds were very comfortable. The very friendly staff (Jack and Bessam especially) were extremely helpful in every way, and set up quite a few day excisions for us, plus arranging for airport transportation. A+++ in all areas.
I will be back.",Date of experience: June 2019,Liquid Adventures Dahab,4,"Dahab, Egypt"
Real fishing in Greece!,"My son and I vacationed for a week in Milos and wanted to arrange a guided fishing trip, something we do in most locations we visit. Nikos and his wife agreed to take Ben out even though we knew their season was coming to an end. The weather wasn't great, it rained most of the day. But Nikos and his wife were the most hospitable hosts, so kind and attentive to Ben. He enjoyed catching a snapper and several other fish, they enjoyed a nice lunch together. Ben has not stopped talking about what wonderful people they were. I hope they keep in touch. It was one of the great days of our time in Greece.",Date of experience: October 2018,Milos Fishing Experience,4,"Milos, Greece"
"Extremely fun, the last trip of the season","I booked this day sail for myself and my 18 yo son. Our group of international vacationers was divided between two boats and we were amongst a very diverse group which proved to be a very enjoyable run of luck. Our two crew members were Happy and Mike, both very experienced and knowledgeable about their jobs. They never stopped working he whole day, but still interacted tremendously with us all. We sailed around to Kleftiko and back, which was plenty. A trip around the whole island would have been too much, in my opinion. The scenery was breathtaking, living up to all the hype in every way. We made three swimming stops, and although the water was a little cold, it was absolutely worth it to come on this sail in October instead of the middle of the summer. Again, the great mix of people made all the difference. (No drunks or a-holes)

It was the best day of our stay in Milos. Thank you Mike, Happy and Mario! ️ Dawn and Ben Quarles, Florida, USA",Date of experience: October 2018,Horizon Yachts,4,"Milos, Greece"
"Pace High School Trip, 2016","They were very accommodating for us, even at the very last minute. The per person charge was pretty high ($44.00 per person) but the experience and the food were both terrific. Greg and Alyssa took very good care of us. Thanks for everything.
