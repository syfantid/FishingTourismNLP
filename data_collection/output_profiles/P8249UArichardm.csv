Iceland Cool,Stayed for 3 nights with the family to do the usual tourist stuff. Excellent hotel in the best location. Suite like room with kitchen island and Nespresso machine! Staff super friendly and the room was very clean and comfortable - especially the bed!,Date of stay: January 2020,Kvosin Downtown Hotel,4,"Reykjavik, Iceland"
Fish-tastic!,We’ve been on plenty of great boat trips in the past but this is so much more. This is authentic fishing and you can either help or sit back and relax. You get all the usual boat trip stuff ie amazing secluded swimming spots and plenty to drink but the cool bit is catching the fish and then Efthemika grills what you’ve caught that day. You don’t get fish any fresher! Highly recommend! Ps. All three of your hosts are so lovely too!,Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
It’ll be amazing when it’s finished!,Apparently it’s their first hotel. And we stayed in the second week it was open. The ‘common parts’ are super cool and the staff are great. However let down by poor systems and the fact that not everything is finished. If they can sort the glitches this will be a great hotel. Great spot in one of the best ski resorts in Europe. We booked a family room for 4 but there were only 3 beds. It took them until 11pm to source the 4th bed and then the heating system was making a terrible noise until fixed. Only one small desk with one of two staff max so even asking a question takes ages. Again I think they will fix this.,Date of stay: January 2019,La Folie Douce Hotel Chamonix,4,"Chamonix, France"
A real gem of a hotel,"We needed somewhere close to Alcester for an overnight stay. I’ve known the Arrow Mill for many years and following the very recent renovations booked a room. What a lovely place to stay. High quality room, very stylish restaurant. Great breakfast. Very lovely friendly staff. Would recommend to anyway. Also under £150 which I think is great value.",Date of stay: December 2018,Arrow Mill,4,"Alcester, United Kingdom"
Sand-tastic!,We’ve just returned from the Sunset experience with Arabian Adventures. It was amazing. Picked up from the hotel in a Toyota Landcruiser. The car takes 6 so as there were only 4 of us we had a short drive to collect a lovely Japanese couple. Then to the desert. 45 mins later we were dune bashing for around an hour. Our young boys loved it. A couple of stops for photos and then we arrived in the Bedouin village. Great food and drinks and then belly dancing to finish. Would highly recommend. Oh. And our driver was Tariq. He was brilliant! Thanks,Date of experience: February 2018,Arabian Adventures,4,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
Nom Nom Norman,$20 for adults. Kids free. Boat to Norman Island for the day (from Tortola). Free drink included and sunloungers on the beach. Great food and service (incl to the beach) and not expensive. Highly recommended.,Date of visit: March 2017,Pirates Bight Restaurant & Bar,4,British Virgin Islands
Still the best!,Best restaurant in BVIs. Simple as that! Loved the sushi and also the ribs. Amazing. Oh and the views are stunning!,Date of visit: March 2017,CocoMaya,4,Virgin Gorda
Home from home,"What an amazing find. After many hours on the internet my wife found the prefect hotel. Only 15 rooms/suites and has the feel of a home. Beautiful building and rooms in a breathtaking setting. So relaxing. Great staff. Lovely food (only issue is that the menu doesn't appear to change?), especially breakfast which is included. Super pool. Not expensive (but not cheap either) with a suite for the 4 of us (two young boys) for a little over £200 a night including breakfast. Just perfect!",Date of stay: July 2016,Finca Hotel Son Bleda,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Perfect Ivy,"We thought this place was amazing. Loved the building and all the flowers and free champagne on arrival ""on the house"". The staff are fun and hardworking and the food is great. Just what we needed after a couple of weeks of fried food! And not expensive $200 for 4 for great food and free cookies to take home. Will definitely go again! Best lunch of our holidays",Date of visit: April 2016,The Ivy,4,"Los Angeles, California"
More for less,We visited LA twice in the same trip. First visit we stayed at the Mondarin. Very nice but no better than the Avalon and the Avalon was 2/3 of the price. Also great heated pool and very chilled and retro. We really liked it and would definitely stay again.,Date of stay: April 2016,Avalon Hotel Beverly Hills,4,"Beverly Hills, California"
Diamond Disney,Spent all day at the park yesterday with our two sons. Absolutely magical. In their 60th year no one does it better. The park is amazing and not just for the rides but the exquisite attention to detail. Perfect. Only gripe is the good. Too much fried stuff. Oh and at about $600 all in for a family of four not cheap either but worth it!,Date of experience: April 2016,Disneyland Park,4,"Anaheim, California"
Zzz with a View,Great hotel. Great design. Great location (right on the wharf). Good sized room plus bath. Games room very good. On the downside parking expensive ($55/night) and service a bit sketchy. Saying that I'd go again. Great view of Alcatraz and the GG bridge if you're lucky!,Date of stay: April 2016,Hotel Zephyr San Francisco,4,"San Francisco, California"
Still the Best,I've been a few times now over 20+ years but I still found it very interesting. The audio tour of the cell block is amazing. You really get a sense of what it must have been like. Very good and my two sons (11 and 8) loved it too,Date of experience: April 2016,Alcatraz Island,4,"San Francisco, California"
Bike the Bridge,Best thing I've ever done (I think). Rent a bike on Fishermans wharf and then cycle over the bridge to Sausalito. Amazing! Do it!,Date of experience: April 2016,Golden Gate Bridge,4,"San Francisco, California"
Best for kids - and adults too!,"Been eating at Captain Flimps (as my kids still call it!) since it opened and its still the best place in town for kids...great pizzas, mocktails for kids and all the stuff kids like to eat but the key is that the food, service and drinks make it great for adults too. We tend to eat there about 50% of the evenings we're in town. The only downside is the queue which can be long if you catch it wrong but they'll pop out with a drink for you if you like! Looking forward to the next 25 years!",Date of visit: May 2015,Captain Flint's,4,"Salcombe, United Kingdom"
Belmond-issimo!,First trip to Rio and Brazil and so went for the most famous hotel. I believe Belmond have recently taken over and have clearly refurbished. It's amazing. Elegant and very comfortable. We have a ocean front suite and adjoining room for the children and it's all so nice. The pool is also amazing - large and warm with plenty of shade. Absolutely first class!,Date of stay: April 2015,Belmond Copacabana Palace,4,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ"
Very sweet!,Short cab ride from the hotel. No queue and quite cheap c.£12 for adults and half that for children. There are two stages and the first is probably the better one with lots of space and food and drink. However the best views are saved for the top. Amazing. Loved it!,Date of experience: April 2015,Sugarloaf Mountain,4,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ"
Purr-fect day's sailing,We booked exclusive use of Lionheart and Captain Steve and first mate Darren looked after us very very well. Great sailing. Amazing snorkelling. As much food and drink as we could manage and just a super relaxing and special day. Thanks guys!,,Aristocat Charters,4,Tortola
Dolphin-tastic!,I've wanted to swim with dolphins for as long as I can remember so jumped at the chance to do it today! I have two young sons and went with a friend and his two young children too. It was amazing! We arrived late but that wasn't a problem. We went for the middle package which was just perfect. The staff were all good but the trainer was superb. Saying that the star of the show was the dolphin. Just beautiful! Overall brilliant and would definitely recommend.,,Dolphin Discovery Tortola,4,Tortola
