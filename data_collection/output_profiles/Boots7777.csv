"Great, relaxing fun","We chartered the boat for the day and weren’t disappointed. What a wonderful day we had with Tassos, a fun and thoughtful host. Stopped for lunch at a wonderful fish restaurant. An all round perfect trip despite catching no fish.",Date of experience: September 2020,Fishing Trips Poros,1,"Poros, Greece"
The biggest pork chop ever,The biggest pork chop I have ever been served. Incredible. It must have been at least 16 inches long and about 2 inches thick. One between two would have sufficed. Be warned. Not for the faint heart. Great service from the owners son too.,Date of visit: September 2020,Dimitris,1,"Poros, Greece"
We will be back,The room was impeccable as were the views from the rooftop restaurant (great food too if a little pricey) and service definitely 5 star. Great location - everything on your doorstep. Felt very safe with great Covid protocol in place. We will definitely be back.,Date of stay: September 2020,Electra Metropolis Hotel,1,"Athens, Greece"
Sheepshead fish,Taken to the counter to choose our own fish. Had one recommended by the fabulous and attentive staff (called sheepshead I think - can’t recommend it enough) aswell as fresh calimari. Not rushed and wonderful to be so closely sat to the waves.,Date of visit: September 2020,Psarotaverna Boreli,1,"Vivari, Greece"
Pick your own fish - sooo,Pick your own fish - sooo good. Staff who knew what they were talking about when it comes to fish. Tried stirna (or something like that) - amazing.,Date of visit: September 2020,Gia mas Taverna,1,"Poros, Greece"
Disaster building site,"I booked 2 rooms through Hotels.com to celebrate my husband recovering from a heart attack and my daughters birthday. Hotel were informed of this in advance. AT NO POINT WERE WE ADVISED THAT A MAJOR REFURBISHMENT WAS BEING CARRIED OUT - IT IS S BUILDING SITE. We even called the hotel the day before to make enquiries and nothing was said. If we had known, we would have stayed elsewhere without a doubt.",Date of stay: August 2020,The Midland,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Fantastic,"Had the pork chop which was the biggest and best I’ve ever eaten. Everything about our visit was fabulous, so much so that we returned the very next day. Can’t recommend this place enough",Date of visit: November 2019,Portokali Restaurant,1,"Larnaca, Cyprus"
Plastic Irish pub,Couldn’t be more disappointed - visited this ‘Irish bar’ in Glasgow city centre to watch what could possibly be described as the biggest annual sporting event in Ireland - the All Ireland Gaelic football final. Unfortunately the commentary was inaudible as they continued to pipe through music whilst the match was on. Very disappointed as were the majority of the customers who turned up to watch it and who subsequently left at half time probably through frustration.,Date of visit: September 2019,Waxy O'Connor's,1,"Glasgow, United Kingdom"
Loved our stay,"We stayed in the suite. Fantastic location, helpful and attentive staff, spotlessly clean room with lovely little balcony on which you can watch the world go by. Loved our stay at this beautiful boutique hotel. Yes breakfast wasn’t great but sometimes it’s not the most important thing, it certainly wasn’t for me. Our stay was perfect and I’d like to think I’ll return one day.",Date of stay: August 2019,999 Luxury Hotel,1,"Nafplio, Greece"
Not overly impressed,The room was tiny but as we were there only the 1 night we coped. There was an oversized wardrobe in the room which would have accommodated a small family - it was a beautiful piece of traditional furniture but was way to big and unnecessary for the room. Umbrellas around the poolside would be useful to give shelter from the August sun. And I had company in the pool too - the thing that is used to clean it - big pipes getting in the way - abandoned - which none of the owners seemed to care about nor in a rush to remove. Disappointing to be honest as we chose this over staying in the town. On a positive- the dogs are really friendly and the views are spectacular.,Date of stay: August 2019,Hotel Petropoulakis God's Land,1,"Gytheio, Greece"
Faultless,"Cannot praise this establishment enough. Fantastic owner who stepped in to save the day when our original hotel booking fell through (due to double booking). Such professional staff, spotlessly clean accommodation, great location, just a short stroll from centre. And the sunbeds are better than those at any 5 star i’ve stayed at. All round perfect.",Date of stay: September 2019,Porto Fiscardo Holiday Apartments,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Idyllic Location - poor service,"Beautiful location, right on the water. Food ok but the service? Wow! Poor doesn’t even come close. I’ve never been (eventually) served by such inattentive staff.",Date of visit: September 2019,Taverna Dimitris,1,"Lefkada, Greece"
Great food,Loved our visit to these markets especially this brilliant eatery. Scallops were fab but the sea bass even better - beautifully cooked. Highly recommend this place and will return one day hopefully,Date of visit: June 2019,Bar Central la Boqueria,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Just brilliant,Can’t fault this place - opted for the belly pork and quiche starters - fantastic. We both had the ribeye with peppercorn sauce for mains - cooked absolutely perfectly and so tasty. Little things like the quality of the tomatoes served with the meal show that they actually really care - it’s all about what it tastes like. Owner very accommodating and friendly too. Wish him every success - he deserves it.,Date of visit: June 2019,Oliver's Pub & Kitchen,1,"Eastwood, United Kingdom"
They do not care,It says something about a restaurant when they don’t approach you until the end of the meal and then show complete indifference when you say the food was over cooked. Such a shame - we had such high expectations. Great location but dreadful food served knowing that they don’t have to care about the quality because they are in a tourist spot. Charged us €17.25 for calimari without any accompaniment when we bought 2 starters and 2 main meals. Rip off.,Date of visit: May 2019,Brisa Marina (Juan el Majorero),1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Extraordinary,The most exquisite selection of cakes and pastries I’ve seen. Beautiful fresh pain au chocolate. Great coffee. What a gem of a place. Lucky Stratford-upon-Avon,Date of visit: November 2017,Hobsons Patisseries,1,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom"
Fantastic food,"Great hosts, great views and fantastic food. Had the kalypso salad which was gorgeous. Also had the shrimps and rabbit stew - just like momma used to make. Efharisto",Date of visit: September 2017,Kalypso Restaurant,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Perfect end to our week in france,"I have to feel sorry for the count and countess - some of the reviews I have read are ludicrous and unreasonable. Our stay in the castle was perfect. Room spotless. Beautiful breakfast in stunning room - worth every penny - croissants, fabulous cheeses of exceptional quality , fresh fruit, and the bread was phenomenal. The count gave us time to answer questions about the chateau and couldn't have been more hospitable. I wish him and his family every success - he deserves it. (Ps even the dog was friendly).",Date of stay: September 2017,Chateau De Bourron,1,"Bourron-Marlotte, France"
Great food,Fabulous food - we had pork chop and sea bream. Great service. Can see why it's number 1 on trip advisor.,Date of visit: September 2017,Meet the Meat,1,"Symi, Greece"
Perfect,Great value. Great location. Old town on your doorstep as is the port so perfect for island hopping. Just bear in mind the area is pedestrianised so you have to carry your suitcases over cobbled streets but worth the effort. Spotless room. Friendly and helpful staff. Thank you Spot Hotel.,Date of stay: September 2017,Spot Hotel,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Best meal we have had in france,Poached egg starters were faultless. Mains substantial and delicious (cassoulet and braised beef) and deserts exquisite. Service professional and friendly. Perfect end to our week in France. Thank you le bistrot du broc,Date of visit: September 2017,Le Bistrot du Broc,1,"Bourron-Marlotte, France"
Wonderful,I am rather late writing this review as we stayed here in August 2015 however I wanted to write the review to say that we had a wonderful stay in this exquisite boutique hotel. The owners were extremely professional and couldn't do enough for us. Will definitely be returning in the future. Spotlessly clean and just a 15 minute walk or so from the stunning harbour where there are numerous high quality tavernas and restaurants.,Date of stay: August 2015,Almyra Hotel,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Brilliant,"Can't praise this experience enough. An amazing, stunning, all round wonderful experience. The setting is truly outstanding, so much so that the film only represents half of the experience and the surroundings the rest - it really is a worth while evening out. In fact, I cannot honestly think of one thing they could do to make this better. I will remember my evening there for a long, long, time.",Date of experience: July 2016,Open Air Cinema Kamari,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Captain Marios ruler of the turtle spotting,"Not much more I can add to the other reviews
Yes there are lots of other trips like this and yes you probably save a euro or two, but when out on the trip this is where Marios is in a league of his own.
His boat carries a max of 25 and is small enough to enter the caves where next to us was a huge boat carrying at least 500 cramped like sardines ( seen less in a migrate
Boat from Syria) boat was also small enough to follow and to manover to get the best possible view of the turtles meanwhile the big boat was still raising it's anchor, another victory to marios.
IF you want the best boat trip, be smart and use Marios boat trip.",Date of experience: August 2015,Mario's Cave and Turtle Boat Trips,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Interesting and moving,"Very moving insight into the famine. Paul, our guide, managed to move me to tears. Has to be one of the best tourist attractions in Dublin and well worth a visit.",Date of experience: January 2015,The Jeanie Johnston: An Irish Famine Story,1,"Dublin, Ireland"
Great Experience,"Yes the rooms/bathrooms are a little a little tired but other qualities compensate. Its brilliantly located and the staff are helpful, thoughtful and kind. This is my 3rd time staying here & yes, I will return. Cheap but very cheerful.",Date of stay: January 2015,Arlington Hotel O'Connell Bridge,1,"Dublin, Ireland"
Disappointing,"Decided to call in to this Michelin star restaurant for a glass of wine on a beautiful sunny afternoon. Found the whole experience very disappointing. First of all, we had to search for a member of staff something I found hard to believe for a establishment of this calibre. When we found a member of staff we were asked to take a seat outside and advised someone would be with us. I don't recall waiting anything like this length of time in any other place I have visited. We waited whilst a menu was brought to our table. No wine on that menu! So when staff eventually returned I requested the wine menu. Another wait. Then another long wait for staff to return to take our order. At this point we must have been there 20 minutes! The drinks were delivered again after a wait but disappointingly, the 'nibbles' - veg patch with humous, didn't get delivered to our table until we had finished our drinks, requested the bill and received it at the table. I'd say it was 45 minutes to get the food. I don't mind paying Michelin star prices (£3.50 for half a Peroni/£7 for 125ml of wine) but I expect Michelin star service, something that is definitely amiss at this establishment. Not even an apology when we said the food was too late and that we were leaving. I think someone has their eye off the ball. Don't think I will be returning if that is the kind of service provided.",,Northcote Restaurant,1,"Langho, United Kingdom"
First time there since the refurb - will return again soon for sure,"Hadn't visited this place in 7 years when the kids were much younger. I love the refurbishment - have to say, the meal was fabulous - in fact, I'd say faultless. Presentation superb and service excellent. Worth every penny. Will return again soon.",Date of visit: May 2014,The Fisherman's Retreat,1,"Ramsbottom, United Kingdom"
Best location in sidari,"It's not the ritz but neither was the price,it's very basic. What you do get is the best location in sidari,15 metres from the beach. The pool and bar is rented out by spyros and Maria
And is kept immaculate.after eating out for several days (average food) I noticed that they served food, we ordered from there and it was by far the best food.now you might pay a couple of euros more( if that) but I assure you it's worth it to eat very tender meat , and as for the cocktails,say no more.watching the sun going down swinging from a hammock listening the sound of the ocean drinking one of bertos specials.it was a pleasure meeting spyros and Maria and wish them success

you both",Date of stay: August 2013,Bertos on the Beach,1,"Corfu, Greece"
