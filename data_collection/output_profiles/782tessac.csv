You must stay here!!,"This place was PERFECT for our honeymoon! Even by Santorini standards the view is out of this world and you can't beat the service. We loved the location because you are halfway between oia and Fira, but I would also recommend renting a car because otherwise you'll need a taxi everywhere. We were greeted with fresh fruit and a bottle of santorinian wine and anything we needed, they took care of. They even packed us sandwiches when we left at 6 am for our flight! Do yourselves a favor and stay here.",Date of stay: August 2016,Aenaon Villas,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Must do!,"This is a truly unique experience! The staff was awesome, food was delicious, and the wine was unlimited. The view of Athens is unbeatable. Plus, there are tons of cool bars in the neighborhood you can go to afterwards!",Date of visit: August 2016,Dinner in the Sky,5,"Athens, Greece"
Really unique experience!,"If you have ever wanted to eat fish that was caught 20 minutes beforehand, this is for you! It is a truly awesome and unique day trip and everyone on board was fantastic. I highly recommend this activity if you want to try something a little different than what everyone does in Santorini. It is family run and very low key, I promise you'll have a great time!",Date of experience: August 2016,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
