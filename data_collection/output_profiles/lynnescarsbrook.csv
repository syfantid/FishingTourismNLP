"Historical, beautiful scenery plus yummy cake!","We are National Trust members & live locally, so visit The Vyne fairly regularly. The house is a must for first time visitors, but the grounds, lake & woodlands change with the seasons, so it's easy to visit repeatedly & see something different every time.
There's a shop & cafe in the old outbuildings, a lovely garden play area for small children & the walled garden supplies freshly picked produce & flowers.
I haven't used it, but I believe there's a golf buggy for those less able to walk from the car park to house.
It is also possible to walk through the woodlands from surrounding lanes, and as a National Trust member, this is my only 'complaint', ie that anyone could do this without paying the entrance fee or having their member's card scanned, which doesn't seem quite fair. We have raised this at the reception desk, but we were advised that it is not feasible to have a payment station at the entrance to the woodlands.
However, if you DO pay the full entrance fee, I think you will get your monies worth - plenty to do & see for all the family, worth taking a picnic & making a day of it!",Date of experience: June 2019,The Vyne,4,"Sherborne St. John, United Kingdom"
Great traditional Greek food in a modern setting,"We are often returning visitors to Lassi, so it's always fun to try new restaurants & tavernas. Tanu's is along the strip with many others in Lassi, which must always be a concern for owners - can they compete with others on price / quality etc.? Well in this case, we'd say they give the more well known places a run for their money & are likely to become one of the top ten. We both had chicken souvlaki - a little predictable but one of our favourites - the chicken was well cooked but moist, served with delicious garlicky tatziki, warm soft pitta & salad at our request, rather than fries. We had a crisp rose wine, followed by home made baklava & ice cream. Served by various family members, some if whom we knew from working in other restaurants, we were made to feel welcome as always in Kefalonia. On this particular evening, we were caught in a torrential downpour & couldn't think of a better way to spend a couple of hours!",Date of visit: June 2018,Tanu's,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Winter warm up,"We have just visited for a winter warm-up & the weather didn't disappoint! Hotel has perfectly clean, comfortable rooms, public areas modern & fresh. This hotel is bigger than we'd normally go for & was busy when we stayed, so probably wouldn't return based on noise levels alone. That said, the dining room was well organised, a wide selection of foods which should appeal to most tastes. We went All Inclusive & enjoyed the good size measures of local spirits etc. There was regular entertainment by the animation team, but not really our thing - we prefer to go out & find small local music venues etc. We probably wouldn't rush back to Playa del Ingles - a bit too Brits abroad for us, almost bordering on seedy in certain areas. We're not prudish, don't mind the gay scene etc., but style was lacking here, and we preferred the Barcelos in Corralejo, Fuerteventura for ambiance.
Small tips - right next door to the hotel is the main post office where there's a cheap cafe if you miss breakfast, & a pharmacy if you need one. North of the main road, about 10 mins walk is a nicer shopping mall than the Yumbo - less touristy & a couple of Spanish bars outside that do tapas. Turn right out of the hotel & you'll find a lovely little coffee & cake & artsy gift shop called Cafe la Colmena.
All in all couldn't fault the hotel but not our favourite location.",Date of stay: March 2018,Occidental Margaritas,4,"Gran Canaria, Spain"
Weekend Break.,"Hotel is positioned in the museum area of Amsterdam, Bus and tram stop only two minutes walk away. We took a bus from the airport, only 10euros each. No cash transaction on bus, use credit card.
Our room was compact clean and quiet, had boutique style decor and was equipped with adequate storage, mini bar, TV and great rainfall shower. The large double bed was very comfortable.
Staff were great.
Highly recommend for short break.
Our thanks in particular to both Andre and Annelies in for their kindness and assistance.",Date of stay: February 2018,Hotel JL No76,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
A magical day!,"Wow!!! This is the one trip in Kefalonia you truly do not want to miss.
We went 'again' this year as last and it was fantastic!
You will leave Katelios aboard Efi and Dimitrious's fishing boat in the morning.
See your fish lunch being hauled aboard and later and grilled by Efi, to be served with a delicious selection of fresh Greek Salad. Meanwhile you can swim in the warm Aquarine waters of a secluded cove with your companions.
The views you will see as you sail along the beautiful coastline will be remembered forever.
'GO' you truly won't be disappointed. Enjoy!!",Date of experience: September 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Relaxing break in wonderful location,"If you have never been to Limone and particularly this hotel, do not be put off by the negative reviews but read all and take the average!
We were concerned about reviews about the food, but pleasantly surprised. We have stayed in Italy before, and at 5 star hotels, but when we booked this one through Thomson, understood it would not be that. We were only able to book an 'eaves room' but as previously noted, although there is no balcony with these, you'll still have a glorious view of Lake Garda. We did ask the Manager whether it would be possible to change after a few days, and he kindly obliged.
Yes, as also previously mentioned, the meals are not a la carte, but perfectly adequate, well cooked and with 2/3 choices each night, suit most tastes. If anything the food is a little bland, but the kitchen is dealing with a wide cross section of cultures and therefore chooses the safest option to please most.
We could not praise staff enough, from Alberto the Manager with his dead-pan Jack Dee style humour to the waiters & waitresses who literally run to keep up (they also have to manage the public restaurant ) and the cleaners who are always chirpy and efficient despite the mundanity of their work.
As frequent travelers we tend to go off piste to find the local supermarket for water, wine, milk etc at a fraction of the cost of shops close to the hotel. The reps will give you a town map, and you'll find the Spar at the top of the hill behind the pretty alleys. If you like a cuppa in your room, take a travel kettle (in your suitcase not hand luggage).
The small pool only has about a dozen sun beds so if that's your thing you're probably best off looking at a different hotel, but we found we could have a dip then return to sunbathe on our balcony on a couple of days.
There are good walks either North towards Riva along the lakeside, and up into the hills behind Limone but you'll need sturdy footwear and stamina! Limone is not a good place for those less able or who live in high heels!
We loved Limone, the lake views & ferry trips and would happily return to the Al'Azurro.",Date of stay: July 2017,Hotel all`Azzurro,4,"Limone sul Garda, Italy"
"Quiet, peaceful hotel.","We have just returned from 2 weeks at this beautiful, very large hotel.
Without repeating previous reviews, I would reiterate that it is an ideal location for peace and tranquillity but not if you are looking for a lively evening. We went half board and found that the meals at breakfast and dinner were excellent in terms of quality and presentation.
We like to go out of the hotel for a daily walk and that was fairly limited - you can walk in either direction along the beautiful beach, but I would advise taking sturdy shoes should you need to negotiate the rocks due to tides. We found that even at high tide the beach was walkable, but the hotel Rep Sue would advise differently. We realised that she obtains most of her info on hearsay rather than personal experience.
The only other tip I would give is that being hotel prices at the bar, we like to buy a bottle of wine and drink it in our room. However although the nearest supermarket sells lovely wine for about â‚¬3 (!), the local hotels have obviously ensured they do not lose out, as the supermarket don't sell screw tops or cork screws! Stupidly we'd forgotten to bring one.
Also be aware that the free hotel WiFi is not great - constantly dips in and out.
For bad weather days (we had a few) we felt it would have been good if the Animation team put on a film on the big screen - fortunately we'd downloaded a few films etc. onto the IPad as the t.v. programmes are all non-English.
Lastly I would point out that being a large, airy space with minimalist decor, it could be considered characterless - we didn't mind this, the hotel has an army of very efficient cleaners keeping all surfaces pristine, but we did notice that noise echoes around the building, particularly in the dining room. This could be a bit irritating for anyone with hearing difficulties.",Date of stay: February 2017,Royal Palm Resort & Spa,4,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Jacuzzi Room Pros and Cons,"Just returned from a lovely R &R week with my partner, having done x 3 Thomson Adults Only hols before, so had a fair idea of what to expect. As always when we read reviews we are guided by the majority, and do always well research location of accommodation etc. We were not disappointed therefore in this hotel, and I will not detail food, service etc as it's all been said already by previous reviewers. The only general comment I'd make would be that as it has been recently rebranded as a Sensimar, we felt there were a few ' teething problems' which no doubt will be corrected with time / experience. But about rooms, we could find little detail about why you would choose to pay extra for the jacuzzi suite but we took the risk and booked one! As also previously mentioned, there are 5 of these rooms, each at the BACK of the hotel facing into the gardens and with a (slightly interrupted) view of the sea and famous Los Gigantes Cliffs. What has not been previously noted however is that these 5 rooms are quite separate from the rest of the hotel accommodation, being below the dining room and therefore outside of dining room operating times, blissfully peaceful. Within the times of 5 a.m. and 11 a.m. and again 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.there is some disturbance from above, but as a couple who like early night's, and able to doze through morning noise, this was fine by us. We used the jacuzzi several times, but it took us 2 days to work out that the temp needs to be up to about 35 degrees to be comfortable, and that there is no on/off switch so the pump kicks in intermittently to bring up the temp once you've set it - the noise of the pump may be intrusive for some. The deck that the jacuzzi is on didn't get the sun at all while we were there, but that may be a blessing in peak summer! And lastly, the jacuzzi was emptied and cleaned fully on the day we left.
All in all the jacuzzi suite room was beautiful and I felt very spoilt.",Date of stay: March 2016,Hotel Tui Blue Los Gigantes,4,"Tenerife, Spain"
