What a find!,"We came across this great cafe while walking around the area soaking up the delightful location near the River Thames.
We popped in for lunch and were very pleased with that we did! The food was freshly prepared, served quickly and was very tasty - two of us had poached egg with avocado on a brioche bun and another had a Greek Salad- all three dishes were excellent. ""Afters"" were home cooked cakes and coffee and it was all perfect with excellent customer service. We will be back and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this establishment.",Date of visit: December 2019,The Fallow Deer,4,"Teddington, United Kingdom"
Mid week lunch,"I know this is a new establishment in Lymington so it’s early days yet but a recent visit with a friend can only be described as “room for improvement”.
We don’t want rubbish on the floor, sticky menus, sticky tables and a too extensive menu- we’d rather be offered far fewer choices, cooked and presented well with fresh ingredients. It’s achievable and then I think it’s worth re visiting- good location in the town centre, nearby parking and a good atmosphere but get the food right.",Date of visit: October 2019,The Sail Inn,4,"Lymington, United Kingdom"
Great river cruise of Amsterdam,"As our first visit to Amsterdam this was a great way to see the highlights of the city from the canals. We booked online and opted for the open ticket so we weren't tied to a specific departure time as we weren't sure of our timings. After walking around all day it was great to sit down for an hour and a half! I also chose this particular company as I could easily find the departure point.
A well worthwhile canal cruise which was reasonably priced, interesting and informative (using headphones) - to be recommended.",Date of experience: September 2019,Amsterdam Canal Cruise with Recorded Commentary,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
A must see in Amsterdam,"When planning our trip to Amsterdam I read about this museum on Trip Advisor and what a good job I did- entry is by booking online only in timed slots. It's well worth a visit and it's important that we are reminded about this period in our history- to be in the actual rooms where Anne Frank and her family lived for 2 years is quite something, albeit quite harrowing and makes her demise so close to the end of the war even more tragic. The trail of visitors walking through the house could be claustrophobic at busy times and the steep stairs are not suitable for those who cannot walk well. A most worthwhile visit nevertheless and certainly a ""must see"" when visiting Amsterdam.",Date of experience: September 2019,Anne Frank House,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
An excellent bright and modern museum cafe,"This cafe was exactly what we wanted after looking at Van Gogh's superb paintings for 3 hours- it was modern and sunny, had a great selection of snacks and light lunches and was reasonably priced. We chose open sandwiches which were delicious and asked for tap water which was produced without any adverse comment, always a good sign :) A great spot to rejuvenate before the next attraction on our busy day in Amsterdam!",Date of visit: September 2019,Van Gogh Museum Cafe Le Tambourin,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
A museum ticket well worth purchasing before your vist,"When planning our trip to Amsterdam I looked at Trip Advisor first for tips and as a result bought tickets to visit the Van Gogh Museum beforehand to save queueing- a multi media guide was included in the price. On a Saturday morning in September it was the right thing to do in order to avoid the crowds- we booked a slot at 10.30.
We found the multi media guide most worthwhile and informative and after 3 hours in the museum we'd seen all we wanted to see. Online booking, an early time slot and multi media guide all to be recommended.",Date of experience: September 2019,Van Gogh Museum Ticket in Amsterdam,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Excellent clean apartment with a great location for walking around the city,"We stayed here for 3 nights and chose the apartment for its location- 10 min walk from the station and perfect for sight seeing and walking around the city of Utrecht.
The apartment was large, ours was located at the rear of the building so was particularly quiet, we'd just forgotten about the church bells on Sunday morning, very Dutch!
The apartment had very good facilities with a well stocked kitchenette. The shower room was small but fine and the shower head height was obviously designed for tall Dutch people..... ;) There was a small courtyard at the rear with table and chairs, useful for eating alfresco, just a shame it was quite shady. All in all an excellent apartment, reasonably priced and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it as a base for walking around the city of Utrecht. Perfect.",Date of stay: September 2019,UtrechtCityApartments,4,"Utrecht, The Netherlands"
An excellent dinner- one of the best!,"After coming out of the station we were tired and hungry and stumbled across this brasserie- we hit the jackpot!
A large party had recently arrived and we saw their food being prepared and simply said to the waitress- ""We'll have whatever they're having"" and it was so tasty- we chose haddock with parsnip puree, asparagus tips, yellow beetroot with salad and frites, not a huge meal but just enough and the haddock was beautifully moist. For dessert we again said we'll have whatever the large party are having as it looked so appetising- 3 mini desserts served with our coffees and they were simply delicious- red fruit cheesecake, fruit tart and a small sponge. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this restaurant and I would go out of my way to return again when in Utrecht. Excellent service too- nothing was too much trouble.",Date of visit: September 2019,De Utrechter Stadsbrasserie en Bar,4,"Utrecht, The Netherlands"
This has to be seen!,"This must be the only traffic light in the world which shows the character Miffy! Its such an unusual object to see, don't miss it - the zebra crossing in front of the traffic light is in coloured panels and not the usual white ones! The Miffy originator apparently came from Utrecht hence the dedication.",Date of experience: September 2019,Miffy's Traffic Light,4,"Utrecht, The Netherlands"
An excellent taverna overlooking the Omalos Plateau,This is a relatively new taverna which we came across by chance when driving across the island from Sami to Livathos. We stopped for a coffee and returned the following day for a meal and we weren't disappointed- when there are many Greeks present you know the food is going to be good! This taverna specialises in grilled food which we ordered and it was excellent along with friendly customer service. Definitely worth the drive if you're heading towards Ag Gerasimos with an excellent view of the monastery.,Date of visit: May 2019,O Makis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great Greek cuisine,"We visited this newly opened restaurant on the sea front at Milford with 4 others and we will definitely be returning!
The food is delicious and authentically Greek, the staff are professional and the whole ensemble is very convivial.
For starters we shared a number of dishes Greek style which included gigantes (giant beans), kolokithokeftedes (courgette balls), feta wrapped in filo pastry with honey and sesame and the best of all, mussels cooked in ouzo- simply devine. Mains included moussaka, giouvetsi ( lamb cooked with orzo pasta), lamb kleftiko ( lamb shank cooked with pots) and pork souvlaki. We couldn’t find fault with any of the dishes, just delicious.
Some of us were given Greek salad as an accompaniment- perhaps it would have been nice if we’d all been offered the salad but if that’s the only criticism then who cares? I for one will definitely return and I consider the Greek cuisine to be “ spot on”- I should know with a Greek family member and frequent trips to the country. The rose greek wine which we chose was also a great success. A great evening and I can’t wait to return,",Date of visit: March 2019,Faros Greek Restaurant,4,"Milford on Sea, United Kingdom"
Amazing walk with great views of Argostoli,"Although I’ve visited the island many times this was my first trip to the Cyclopean Walls- its a bit like a well kept secret, not many people know about the walk and
the giant stones above the area known as Krania.
We were particularly fortunate as a local resident led the way along old shepherd tracks to the summit of a hill where we were shown the giant stones marking the ancient city of Krane, dating back to 3-5BC when the island consisted of states, the largest being Sami, a long time before Argostoli was even in existence. The circular walk took about 2.5 hours and sturdy footwear was essential. If you enjoy going off the beaten track then this is for you- start opposite the builder’s yard on the Koutavos road and follow the red spots of paint on the rocks.",Date of experience: February 2019,Cyclopean Wall,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Good lunch stop,"We stumbled across this taverna after we’d walked to the waterfall near Poros which was a great experience in itself. We were hungry after our trek and this taverna did not disappoint. It was quiet being mid afternoon and February but nevertheless we were welcomed and the chef (!) told us which dishes he’d cooked for that day. We chose spaghetti “kima”, which is the equivalent of spaghetti bolognese- it was so delicious, a very wise choice! I have no hesitation in recommending Pantelis restaurant for a tasty, reasonably priced lunch.",Date of visit: February 2019,Pantelis Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Excellent cafe in the centre of Argostoli,"It’s hard to beat Premier. I’ve been many times and I love the food, the service is faultless and the atmosphere is relaxing. It stands out above the others in the town and is frequented by all those who wish to meet up and enjoy good company.
Where Premeier goes, others follow so why not consider serving water from glass bottles? The clientele and tourists will appreciate your efforts towards saving the environment and I’m sure other establishments would follow your lead.
I look forward to returning and seeing the result of my comment above.",Date of visit: February 2019,Premier Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great brunch!,"Although it was a Saturday lunch time and it was very busy we were shown a place to sit and wait for a table which didn’t take too long and it was definitely worth the wait.
Wide variety of food choices and excellent service- I had a squash and pumpkin seed club sandwich which I’d recommend, another diner had the steak sandwich and another guest had the pulled pork subway- all were excellent.
Definitely one to return to on our next visit to Rotterdam and we look forward to sitting outside in the summer.",Date of visit: January 2019,By Jarmusch,4,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands"
A great museum!,"What a treat on a cold Sunday morning in January! We booked our tickets online to avoid the queues and also requested audio equipment which is definitely worthwhile. As soon as you see a particularly interesting painting or object, search for the number on display and you’re treated to an interesting few minutes about the item- so much more interesting. The Rembrandts were obviously visually appealing but one of the highlights for me were the dolls houses on display especially as I had just read the The Miniaturist - a delight to see the attention to detail. Our visit was rounded off by a visit to the Museum Cafe- well worthwhile.",Date of experience: January 2019,Rijksmuseum,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
A different experience,"We tried this restaurant on a Friday evening - the atmosphere was good and certainly different- interesting food, eating with your fingers which is certainly a skill if you’re eating “teg” with a dish that has sauce, just not for me. Perfectly resonable service but due to the food I probably wouldn’t return but then it’s a matter of personal taste.",Date of visit: January 2019,De smaak van Afrika,4,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands"
Clean modern hotel with good location for walking into centre,"We booked this hotel for its location in order to visit the Carnival and were not disappointed. Huge numbers of people descend on the city for the weekend from all over Greece and beyond and we booked up some months previously- to be recommended. The staff were excellent, breakfast was very good and the room was clean and comfortable. The only small criticism was the room was too warm on the first night so on the second night we turned off the heating completely. Otherwise a most enjoyable weekend.",Date of stay: February 2018,Airotel Patras Smart Hotel,4,"Patras, Greece"
Amazing cathedral,"This is well worth a visit - the cathedral is purported to contain the bones of St Andrew- apart from his finger which went to Scotland in the 1960’s.
It’s a beautiful building and well kept and a delight to visit.",Date of experience: February 2018,Agios Andreas Church,4,"Patras, Greece"
Excellent lunch time snack in a cosy cafe,"A friend and I popped in to this cafe to escape the pouring rain and were not disappointed - we ordered a couple of coffees and I had a delicious cheese and tomato toasted sandwich. But the icing on the cake was the side salad- not the usual piece of lettuce, tomato and cucumber but a bowl of fresh young green leaves, cherry tomatoes, de seeded cucumber slices and grated carrot all garnished with pomegranate seeds and French dressing. Simply delicious!
The coffee was great, too- I shall not hesitate to return, raining or not!",Date of visit: January 2018,Saltwater,4,"Milford on Sea, United Kingdom"
Great cafe with great food,"During a coastal walk along the seafront at Milford we stopped off at this delightful cafe for a drink and a cake. We had a couple of excellent cups of coffee, (not everywhere serves good coffee but here it's excellent and not bitter) and indulged in a couple of freshly made gluten free cakes too, simply because they looked so delicious and they tasted great.
We will definitely return to this gem of a cafe- great food with excellent service and reasonable prices.",Date of visit: January 2018,Hurst On The Hill,4,"Milford on Sea, United Kingdom"
Delightful cafe with great views,"I've visited this small cafe many times perched up in the mountains on the road to Ag Gerasimos Church and monastery. It's worth stopping here for a coffee and homemade food- very traditional interior with excellent service by the delightful Effie. She makes all her customers feel so welcome and you get to experience the real Greece with her local products for sale. The views are amazing over the surrounding hills and I have no hesitation in recommending this place when travelling up to or returning from Ag Gerasimos especially as there is a distinct lack of eateries actually at the monastery.
Have a coffee on the way back at Old Time!",Date of visit: October 2017,Old Time,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Central location in a quiet square,"Libretto is located in a quiet square just off the main pedestrianised shopping street. Its a great spot to have a coffee and give the feet a rest after looking in the numerous shoe shops of Argostoli. Its fairly priced, the service is excellent and the coffee is good. If you're lucky you'll get a slice of cake too at no extra charge. In the summer when the temperatures are really hot there is plenty of shade too which is a great plus point. I love it.",Date of visit: October 2017,Libretto Cafe,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Tasty pizza but expensive,I visited this pasta and pizza restaurant recently with my husband on a Sunday evening in Argostoli when there isn't too much open. The pizza tasted good and we had a couple of drinks too but the total bill was the same as eating at a local taverna for 3 courses. For this reason alone I probably won't return in a hurry but I have to say the pizza was good.,Date of visit: October 2017,Pizza Al Forno,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Premier by name but not by toilet facilities,"I love coming to this cafe and visit frequently. It’s in a great location and the food and service are both excellent. However this is 2017 and bad Greek toilet facilities are a thing of the past yet Premier still has to catch up.
It’s such a shame as this establishment prides itself as being one of the best in Argostoli. Please can you provide toilet seats in the ladies loo? It’s not too much to ask for and please keep the toilets clean. Other places manage it and a cafe/restaurant with the reputation of Premier should be able to manage it, too!",Date of visit: October 2017,Premier Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Excellent lunch in a traditional setting,"I visited the famous Betty's Tea Rooms for the first time recently and I wasn't disappointed- English tradition at its best, excellent customer service combined with tasty English food all in a charming atmosphere. This is a must for any visitor to York and would also appeal to foreign visitors to experience a very English lunch in a delightful setting; the wait in the queue is certainly worthwhile. The addition of a glass of Pimms with lemonade for my friend and I was just the icing on the cake, never mind the really tasty cakes we had for dessert. I've never seen a cake stand like it. An unforgettable experience!",Date of visit: May 2017,Bettys Cafe Tea Rooms - York,4,"York, United Kingdom"
Fantastic seafood restaurant right next to the beach,"Excellent seafood in an excellent setting right next to the beach at Friars Cliff- this restaurant is not to be missed. The food is of a very high quality and the seafood is particularly good- the ""Noisy Platter"" is to be recommended. The platter included mussels, scallops, prawns, squid and chunky chips all beautifully presented. I will definitely return to this restaurant and for my friends and I, it was an unforgettable lunch in a great setting- to be highly recommended.",Date of visit: May 2017,The Noisy Lobster at Avon Beach,4,"Christchurch, United Kingdom"
Unique location,"I visited this cafe with 2 friends last week and from a previous visit we'd all remembered it's unique location- simply unforgettable! It looks like any other cafe until you walk ""through"" some huge rocks which take you right to the waters edge in a slightly elevated position on decking with stunning views.
We didn't have a meal as we only required a snack, Club sandwich x3 and a drink each-I can recommend the fresh fruit cocktail, like a smoothie, simply delicious but it's the location that makes Remetzo unique. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the port area of Poros.",Date of visit: April 2017,Remetzo,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Excellent food in a delightful location opposite the bay,"4 of us had dinner here last night, which was our second visit in 10 days and we were not disappointed. The food and customer service was excellent. 2 of us had seafood pasta, one had carbonara pasta and the fourth person had a traditional souvlaki- we all commented on the high standard of the food.
We were recommended to have feta with honey and sesame for a starter and it was simply divine, not necessarily flavours that you'd normally put together but it worked! To be recommended.
Captain's Table is well worth a visit when visiting Argostoli.",Date of visit: April 2017,Captain's Table Cafe Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great selection of authentic Greek dishes,"This is where the Greeks go for Sunday lunch! That's enough of a recommendation for me - we were not disappointed. Every time we visit Kefalonia whatever the time of the year we always make a point of visiting Pallia Plaka- the various cooked dishes are always on show so you know exactly what you're eating. I particularly like the tsigaridia - a plate of local greens cooked with herbs, tomato, onions and garlic - delicious.",Date of visit: February 2017,Palia Plaka restaurant - paliaplaka,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great hot chocolate!,"It was a winter's afternoon and yes even in Greece sometimes you have to sit inside at a cafe and indulge in a hot chocolate - we were not disappointed, the chocolate was velvety smooth topped with whipped cream, so tasty. A small biscuit was placed on the side at no extra cost, even better. Good service and a central location topped off a very welcome cafe break.",Date of visit: February 2017,Ristretto Cafe,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Terrific Italian Restaurant,"We discovered this authentic Italian restaurant on Trip Advisor and were so glad we did! The food was extremely good- I had a risotto made with champagne and lobster - it was the festive season and it was heaven to the taste buds. The other 3 guests had freshly made pizzas, decent size and lots of topping. A house red wine went down well with our food. A gem of a restaurant with attentive and courteous staff, reasonably priced and deliciously cooked Italian food. To be highly recommended and I can't wait to go there for another visit.",Date of visit: December 2016,Tomo Pizzeria & Restaurant,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Amazing Greek Cuisine with a twist,"This was a birthday celebration dinner for 4 of us and we weren't disappointed. The food is served in a ""tapas"" style to be shared, more interesting for the taste buds :) The choice of dishes was very varied and we very adventurous, even trying snails and chips - a somewhat acquired taste but enjoyed by the Greek guest! Other dishes we ate included youvetsi cooked with lemon as opposed to the usual tomato which was delicious and to be recommended, beetroot carpaccio, spanakopita and lemon oregano chicken. For dessert we had Greek milk pie brulee which was divine, loukoumia again really delicious and the only disappointment of the evening was the loukoumades. They were simply not up to scratch and nothing like the proper Greek version. Having said that I applaud Opso for attempting to cook them again which unfortunately was not successful but they also did not charge us for either portion. Full marks to Opso. I wish more restaurants had excellent customer service like Opso. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this restaurant- I can't wait to go back!",Date of visit: November 2016,Opso,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Great place for brunch,4 of us visited The Spoke on Holloway Road for brunch on a Sunday- just what we needed after a morning's DIY. We all had a variation on a burger and all four were delicious; side dishes of sweet potato chips were particularly good as was the pulled pork burger. The coffee was excellent too- really mild. Excellent customer service and food made for a great venue for brunch :) To be recommended.,Date of visit: November 2016,The Spoke,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Amazing day's fishing trip,"Firstly we had a very warm welcome from skipper Michalis' to his boat at Agia Paraskevi- we motored to an area near Spartia where nets that were nearly a mile long had been laid the previous day. The crew picked up the nets and we watched the nets being cleared; the anchor was dropped and we did some sea fishing with rods that was very successful for everyone. Then we moved to a small bay where we were able to swim while the crew prepared the lunch which was delicious especially the pasta!
A really interesting day and worth every penny! (or cent!) Ideal for families.",Date of experience: October 2016,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great location for visiting Berlin,"We booked a family room for 3 adults as we were visiting Berlin over 2 days. The hotel didn't disappoint and the location was central, great for sight seeing. The room was large and attractively priced with a very modern large bathroom. I can't comment on the breakfast as we preferred to eat locally at a much lower price.
The room was comfortable and facilities were good-my only comment would be regarding the free internet which wasn't easy to connect. 1GB for one device for one hour was simply not sufficient for our requirements and the only other wifi was one hour in the lobby. It's a shame as this is a great modern hotel but free unlimited wifi should be standard in this day and age.",Date of stay: August 2016,INNSiDE by Meliá Berlin Mitte,4,"Berlin, Germany"
Great location and great seafood,"Enetiko is located right next to the beach at Avithos, with the sound of the waves crashing on the shore- an excellent family run taverna with lots of fish dishes. We chose the fish platter for 2 people priced at 28 euros- excellent value and more than enough for the 2 of us, to be highly recommended. Complimentary water melon rounded off an excellent meal.",Date of visit: August 2016,To Enetiko,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Excellent food,"A group of 5 friends visited this recommended taverna recently in Skala- slightly outside the village but worth the extra journey. The food was excellent and the position so close to the sea was perfect. We were celebrating a friend's birthday and it certainly didn't disappoint. Main course choices included moussaka, "" The best I've ever tasted"" and prawns with spaghetti which was very tasty and to be recommended. Excellent house wine finished off a memorable meal with a reasonably priced bill. Definitely will return. :)",Date of visit: May 2016,Old Times,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Excellent food in a shabby chic environment,"The Fat Radish had been recommended to us by different people and it was well worth searching out- the food was excellent, tasty and interesting in a positive sense. The customer service was faultless, nothing was too much trouble. For starters we ate crab gratin with cheese and shredded leeks, extremely tasty. Main course was The Fat Radish plate- a mixture of exotic vegetables with tahini on the side and ginger and carrot sauce and Green Thai Monkfish Curry served with wild rice. It was delicious and my only criticism would be the larger than expected amount of vegetables in the curry and too few pieces of monkfish, very disappointing. A cheese platter was chosen for the last course with local cheeses, walnut bread, dried apricots and chutney- a very fitting end to a lovely meal.",Date of visit: April 2016,The Fat Radish,4,"New York City, New York"
Great way to visit Central Park,"The two of us hired Citi bikes to ride around Central Park and loved the experience. We were used to hiring bikes in other cities so knew the system, even though the handlebars can be heavy but such an excellent way to see a new place and very good value. We had a particularly sunny day in Central Park which made the experience that more pleasurable and we just had to remember not to get in the way of the horse drawn carriages, runners and skaters. Definitely the best way to see the Park!",Date of experience: April 2016,Citi Bike,4,"New York City, New York"
