Authentic Greek Fishing Boat!,"We went out with the lovely Antonia and her skipper husband and had a wonderful afternoon and evening. Itâ€™s a truly authentic experience with lovely fresh fish cooked on the boat, casting of professional nets, line fishing, and swimming in the beautiful crystal blue sea. Highly recommended and great value too!",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
