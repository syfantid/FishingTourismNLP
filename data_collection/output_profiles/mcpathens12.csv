Authentic Aegean Fishing Trip,"Exceeded all expectations despite glowing reviews! Must, must do. Captain Anthi puts you on the bite. And her crew is competent and friendly. Just as all the reviews have stated earlier. That would be enough for a great day fishing. But these folks go way beyond. Anthi was constantly teaching and educating our family. She taught the adults and teens technique, species, history, and conservation. She protects the sea and has an incredible passion to teach others to do the same. We've fished fresh and salt around the world. The Giorgaros tour is at the top of our list!",Date of experience: July 2019,Giorgaros fishing tours Santorini,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Even more hidden gem!,One of the best dining experiences you can have in Baltimore. Was in for lunch recently and construction is really hurting their business. You will be sorry for long wait or maybe you can’t even find table once this section on the waterfront is complete. The addition of their new “river bar” will make this the place to be for high class successful set.,Date of visit: August 2018,Ouzo Bay,1,"Baltimore, Maryland"
Guided is always better,Had great day Kayaking on the Lake with the family. Amina was knowledgeable and patient with my crew. Yea we could have grown kayaks on roof ourselves however we would have shorted our experience. Maneuvering the lake is simple however Amina’s story telling kept the attention of two adolescent boys. No small feet. Negotiating launch and especially beach landing without angering the crowds could not be accomplished with her. Overall great day!,Date of experience: August 2018,Tahoe Adventure Company,1,"Tahoe Vista, California"
"Excellent, truly, but the beach....","Ok Ive learned that Im a beach snob. Walking the beach for hours is more important that I understood previously. If this isn't a high priority for you then they deserve the 5 stars. Food, drink, property, service all excellent. Any complaints come from those that don't understand where they are on the planet. Bugs, humidity, smells are all part of the jungle and ocean coast. The beach is iffy, They have built a lagoon to protect their beaches from wave erosion and probably sea weed. Excellent for kids but not for those who like waves beating the shores and long sandy beaches to walk. Again all is excellent but I did miss my long walks.",Date of stay: April 2018,Bahia Principe Luxury Akumal,1,"Akumal, Mexico"
Beautiful Beach,Beautiful Beach however getting overrun by tourists. Seaweed can be issues at times as well. Find more isolated beach. too many peeps.,Date of experience: April 2018,Akumal Beach,1,"Akumal, Mexico"
Excellent DC Location,National Zoo is just across the street as is DC Metro station to launch you into the Nations Capital. Great restaurants and amenities as well. All the business amenities exist as it has extensive conference space however this is good family location as well.,Date of stay: June 2018,Washington Marriott Wardman Park,1,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"
"Quality sushi, great atmosphere",We totally pigged out. Two rounds of sushi dented the visa although after being o feet all day we earned it. drinks were just ok but hate sushi was excellent. All fresh and numerous house favorites that we indulged. Sorry no recollection of a specific roll or dish but all was excellent. Price was about average for the area which is not cheap however quality leaves you thinking you got your money’s worth. Really nice vibe with many locals which is always a great sign.,Date of visit: June 2018,Tono Sushi,1,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"
Must visit for out of towners,"The Mall is the center of it all. Jefferson, Smithsonian, Capitol building and more. You can spend all day sight seeing, watching people, and visiting museums. Must must place to spend an afternoon.",Date of experience: June 2018,National Mall,1,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"
Nations History,Great experience for patriots and those with imagination. No flashing lights or sounds just rich history. Standing on deck within sight of Federal Hill and short distance from where Francis scott Key penned our national anthem is incredible. Great history lesson that the kids will surely remember. For others Hooters is across the street.,Date of experience: October 2016,Historic Ships in Baltimore,1,"Baltimore, Maryland"
Asian in the hills,"Very good restaurant really. Service, food quality, and pricing all very much above average. Sushi was nice surprise as was variety of Sake. Overall you'll be very happy in your in the mood for asian cuisine.",Date of visit: May 2017,Asian Express,1,"Charlottesville, Virginia"
"Food, Drink, Views, Beach and Waves",One of my favorite places in VA Beach to visit. Ok its my favorite by a mile. Great eats and people watching. The beach and waves are icing on the cake. The menu is extensive and sushi is awesome. Pricing is mid to upper range,Date of visit: July 2017,Mahi's Seafood and Sushi,1,"Virginia Beach, Virginia"
Fine dining in VA Beach,Fine dining all around but your at the beach and no where near it. Ok thats the only minus. The dining experience itself is excellent. A bit pricey however well worth it. Leave the kiddies home the food is too good for them unless they have mature palates. Great date night and those looking for romantic ambience. Loved the northern Italy however all looks exceptional.,Date of visit: January 2017,Aldo's Ristorante,1,"Virginia Beach, Virginia"
One of the best on east coast,"Exceptional people watching and those with activity in mind. Bike, blade, walk or run. Plenty of space to handle the largest of crowds. Amenities abound! Restaurants, snacks, drinks and sights are everywhere. Not a quiet stroll location expect in off season. This a boardwalk bussing with activity.",Date of experience: May 2017,Virginia Beach Boardwalk,1,"Virginia Beach, Virginia"
Put both charters on the fish!,"1/2 day, morning, charter. Professional, knowledgeable, patient, and they put us on the fish!! 2 boats, 6 shark, 60+ Spanish Mackerel, ton of bass, and more. Great time was had by all.",Date of experience: July 2017,Fish Hook Charters,1,"North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"
Good place to walk and eat,Nice venue for walking shopping and eats. Typical tourist trap like but good for family night out. Most restaurants are average at best. Normans is the exception.,Date of experience: July 2017,Barefoot Landing,1,"North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"
Bucket List,"Fantastic adventure! Must, must do! Not a leisure hike however nothing too strenuous. Much mud and rain likely but reward it fantastic!! Our family will never forget playing with lava and learning first hand how the islands were created.",Date of experience: August 2016,Epic Lava Tours,1,"Island of Hawaii, Hawaii"
Fine dining at the beach,Most of the restaurants are just average to below at the beach. Much fried mess that taste great but require copious cocktails and beer. All are overpriced for whats being served but it make kids happy and parents content. Normans is one of just a few fine dining opportunities. Leave the kids home and enjoy quality meal and atmosphere.,Date of visit: August 2016,Greg Norman Australian Grille,1,"North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"
Witness the creation of land!!!!,"Off the hook, bucket list buster, unforgettable experience! Scientific, beautiful, amazement, and spiritual. Just do it! Fantastic adventure.",Date of experience: July 2016,Aloha Lava Tours,1,"Island of Hawaii, Hawaii"
If your in Baltimore you must stroll the Inner Harbor,"One of the nicest downtowns in America. Shops, sights, shopping, and eats. The Inner Harbor is Baltimore and vice versa.",Date of experience: January 2017,Inner Harbor,1,"Baltimore, Maryland"
"Exceptional during home game, at other times just an average pub.",Game days its a great visit. Atmosphere and people watching exceptional. Food and drink is good but nothing special. All improves after a few pops. Without O's or Ravens its actually a bit below average because of location. There are far better pubs on better blocks.,Date of visit: July 2016,Pickles Pub,1,"Baltimore, Maryland"
LOVE THIS PLACE! But you shouldn't go.,"I gave it away in my title but I really don't want you to go. They're doing well so I don't think I'm hurting revenues but stay away. I would hate to have the place get overcrowded. They were expanding at our last visit. I'm sure its even better as the previous shop had enough character to go around. Great sandwiches, entrees, and of course coffee. Make no mistake the visit is about the service and atmosphere.",Date of visit: May 2016,Soup Nutz & Java Jazz,1,"Maui, Hawaii"
"Beautiful! just beautiful beach, respect the waves","Rates as top beach in United States year after year. Its beautiful, top shelf amenities, great people watching, everything you can ask for in a day at the beach. However, you must respect the water despite its beauty. There is often a hazardous shore break that can take down and injure the strongest of legs. Watched many get wiped out and injured through the years. Most recently elder gentleman snapped his ankle. Just be careful, don't want to scare you away. It is so spectacular that it can lull you into a false sense of security.",Date of experience: May 2016,Ka'anapali Beach,1,"Maui, Hawaii"
Novel breakfast lets you be the chef!,Nice approach to breakfast however be prepared to cook a bit. If your not interested in cooking and the novelty of making the family breakfast there are other pancake houses. This is for the more adventuresome and great fun for the family. Let the kids cook for the adults for a change. Nice time.,Date of visit: May 2016,Slappy Cakes Maui,1,"Maui, Hawaii"
Very good shopping not that i would recommend it in Maui,"Very interesting assortment of shops and dining. I don't think anyone should shop in Maui although I understand my opinion is not a popular one with many. Our household was split as we have a few that LOVE to shop particularly at some of the high end shops. Its good for Dad, or any others on the low shop lovers in that there are cocktails close by. I enjoyed the beach and sunset why the ladies admired the goods. There are some galleries with fine works that are worth a stop particular while enjoying those cocktails.",Date of experience: October 2016,Whalers Village Museum,1,"Maui, Hawaii"
Love the dolphin show!,"Great activity in the inner harbor. High interest, high education. Great retreat to beat the Maryland heat if visiting in the summer. I've visited Aquariums from SOCal, Tennessee, NY to Grand Caymen. You don't have to love marine life to enjoy the visit.",Date of experience: November 2016,National Aquarium,1,"Baltimore, Maryland"
Great rainy day or first date destination,"Well it was a great dating location but no longer, kids, Cant go on rainy day because kids would never endure it. But still a great location. Many fine works and great atmosphere. They host many special events as well so check their website.",Date of experience: February 2016,Baltimore Museum of Art,1,"Baltimore, Maryland"
Amazing Park for history buffs and all those who love USA,"There is a great Discovery episode that can be found online explaining the writing of the Star Spangled Banner. Prepare for trip by refreshing your US History and British attack on Baltimore. THEN visit and you will be travel in time. If your not into you country, war, history, or patriotism then hit Hooters for some wings. Its a short walk across the Harbor and the wings are excellent.",Date of experience: June 2016,Federal Hill Park,1,"Baltimore, Maryland"
It's just ok,It's good really. The food is just average there are so many finer dining experiences in the Inner Harbor. They get better marks for location and atmosphere but the overall experience is just average. Roys and Oceanside blow it away. Hit either for awesome seafood experience although a few more dollars. If your looking for crabs there are a dozen better choices.,Date of visit: October 2016,Phillips Seafood,1,"Baltimore, Maryland"
You haven't really seen Yellowstone unless you experience Yellowstone,"Yellowstone Safari Company revealed Yellowstones beauty and majesty. 10's of thousands of visitors drive into the park each year however all miss the opportunity of a lifetime. You haven't really been to Yellowstone unless you get backcountry and have people who open your eyes to the true wonder. Yellowstone Safari Company is the best for doing just that. Their guides have the education and ability to communicate this knowledge like few others.
And Yes the Llamas were an experience unto their own. Just an incredible time hiking with these awesome animals. Taken alone the guides were unbelievable. The Llama tour just incredible. Together you have an adventure of your lifetime. Just book it you will have the time of your life.",Date of experience: June 2016,Yellowstone Safari Company,1,"Bozeman, Montana"
Great perspective offered by Jenny Lake,We took the shortcut across the lake to begin our hike. We had great view of the mountains and better understanding of the geologic formations. Plus a fun boat ride!,Date of experience: June 2016,Jenny Lake Boating,1,"Moose, Wyoming"
Historic Perspective,We had lunch and look while we waited for Old Faithful to reload. Our awesome Yellowstone Safari Company guides filled our minds with stories and adventures wrapped up at the Inn. Great experience for all ages!,Date of stay: June 2016,Old Faithful Inn,1,"Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming"
Buffalo everywhere!,"So we spent a few days in the north back country and hadn't seen a single Buffalo. Well our Yellowstone Safari Company guide explained to us their migration patterns. We hit Lamar the next morning, viewed a grizzly dining on Buffalo, wolves, and thousands of Buffalo!!!",Date of experience: June 2016,Lamar Valley,1,"Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming"
Awesome,The entire Geyser basin is fantastic. Must spend time visiting these wonderful formations. Plan for at least 1/2 day enjoying the separate basins.,Date of experience: June 2016,Grand Prismatic Spring,1,"Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming"
beautiful falls,great falls and short walk. very crowed though for our likings. its very good to see but not a must see if time short. get away from the crowds and you'll get better view of Yellowstones majestry.,Date of experience: June 2016,Upper Falls,1,"Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming"
"Great view, very good food",For whatever reason we kept ending up here for lunch. As we criss crossed the park for the week we dined on 3 occasions. Food and drink was always very good! The view of Signal Mountain was really the draw. Definitely make this dining fit your agenda as its location is ideal for jumping in all directions.,Date of visit: June 2016,Deadman's Bar,1,"Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming"
yep it's #1. by miles,"posted under the bar, should be here for the Grill.

Quaint town,Nice visit to town after a few days in back country. its a quaint town with food and shopping. gave us great place to recharge and get a civilization fix. We lucked out and there was an open market bazaar taking place. maybe thats every weekend. It was good to see the town and then get back to the parks.,Date of experience: June 2016,Town Square,1,"Jackson, Wyoming"
Jumping off point for Royal Carib cruise,What a pleasant surprise. We love Hawaii and the caribbean however had never visited PR. We found it a beautiful island and loved Old San Juan! The castles architecture and history was fascinating! The people were friendly and accommodating throughout the island. A ton of culture wrapped into this historic city. Even the younger kids soaked up the caribbean history.,Date of experience: June 2016,Old San Juan,1,Puerto Rico
SEE ST LUCIA!,"We had the pleasure of spending a day with Joy and his family 15 years ago prior to marriage. Took the kids and cousins back to visit again. Joys operation remains top notch!! His boy Vonn guided us on land and sea. We visited the mud baths, town, mountains, beaches, and sea. Also had dinner at Joys new home which while more grand has not lost a bit of warmth or authenticity. The kids and adults all had a wonderful time! If you visit St Lucia you MUST book adventure with Joy!!",Date of experience: June 2016,Joy's Adventure Excursion and Coastal Cruise,1,St. Lucia
Most fan friendly viewing of Americas game,"First of the throwback stadiums which allow fans an uncles and personal feel at the ballpark. Off the hook concessions and repurposed Yard makes this one of the nicest ballparks in the country. To be fair Washington, Arlington, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and others have caught up however Baltimore was the original fan favorite.",Date of experience: June 2016,Oriole Park at Camden Yards,1,"Baltimore, Maryland"
Hawaii Old School,"5 star location, 3 star accommodations, 1 star prices. Beachfront on Kaanapali, it doesn't get any better. Price is very affordable. The catch is the rooms and amenities. There is an old Hawaii feel which is very nice. Staff and service is fantastic. The Hotel is just dated. Rooms and amenities are good just not what you expect on Kaanapali Beach. We loved it! But keep expectations in check. If you want spectacular beach, sand, location and good bar grilll with livable rooms then there is no better find. We've stayed Four Seasons, Ritz, Grand Wailea and enjoyed this property just as much. We aren't a stay in room all day or any part of the day. If you want to sit in room and have food and massages brought in you should stay elsewhere. If you want a great landing spot after spending day in surf and sand then this is place for you.",Date of stay: August 2015,Ka'anapali Beach Hotel,1,"Maui, Hawaii"
Excellent dining experience,"One of the best in the Inner Harbor. Best for special occasions and company. Soups, salads, seafood and steaks are all five star. I like to spend my money on meals I cannot prepare myself. That would include the entire menu at Charlestons. Truly one of the finest dinning experiences you can have anywhere.",Date of visit: March 2015,Charleston Restaurant,1,"Baltimore, Maryland"
Good time killer for nostalgic visitors,"The Inner Harbor has many sights, attractions, drinking and dinning opportunities. The Torsk is a floating museum from days long past but not long enough. It's a facinating craft from the mid 40's and was a player in WWII. It's a nice tour however there are many other sights that tie 1800's Baltimore and the War of 1812 together. Be sure to experience this history before moving into the ""modern"" 40's.",Date of experience: March 2015,USS Torsk,1,"Baltimore, Maryland"
Perfection for 4 4.,"Family of four, 10,12 age boys, who love water sports. There is no better place in Grand Cayman. Excellent resort with everything we needed and desired. Clean, comfortable, great food, superb amenities and of course exhausting water activities. The hotel just completed refurbishing and it is awesome. We stay 8 days, 4 on campus The other 4 touring the island, Rays, Cays, Turtles, exploring. While on campus we enjoyed the snorkeling right off the beach and included SUPping. Resort food was excellent with other very enjoyable restaurants right across the street. Just an excellent time!",Date of stay: November 2014,Grand Cayman Marriott Beach Resort,1,Grand Cayman
Great family visit,Good break from underwater sites. At least for us to dry out a bit. All our excursions were awesome because cruise ship attendance was low.,Date of experience: November 2014,Cayman Marine Lab,1,Grand Cayman
good eats,good family eats! We sailed up to the dock and tied off. Food is always better when you reach it by water.,Date of visit: November 2014,Cimboco,1,Grand Cayman
Taste of Cayman,Family enjoyed the break from resort food. Island atmosphere very relaxed. Food offered variety of flavors so everyone could try and share a different spice of the islands.,Date of visit: November 2014,Coconut Joe's Beach Bar & Grill,1,Grand Cayman
Only crowd was underwater,"You have to have your expectations set. It wasn't the best snorkeling, nor most fascinating exhibits however the chance to see sharks feed, snorkel with sea turtles and schools of fish all for a small fee was fantastic. Note: there were NO cruise ships so the site was ours. Maybe 30 people? not good for business but it was awesome for us! Check the port schedule and visit when cruisers are not in town.",Date of experience: November 2014,Cayman Turtle Centre: Island Wildlife Encounter,1,Grand Cayman
Beautiful Beach,"Its a beautiful beach, what more can you say. The water is as clear and sand as soft as any in the world. The beach is very long and you can people watch a variety of sights. The shores are speckled with low key homes, developments and high end resorts. Take a walk to gather some shells, take a break to enjoy the people watching, then return to the shells when no one around.",Date of experience: November 2014,Seven Mile Beach,1,Grand Cayman
7 Seas Charter Private Charter,"7 Seas Charter a small private company is a MUST!!! Flexible to get us out before the cruise ships and take us to unique sites. SKIP the cruise companies and larger tour groups. I don't think the cost was even much different however its WELL worth it even if it is. We had the Rays to ourselves, one other small group arrived. There were maybe 10 of us in the water. The beauty and serenity of the sandbar is priceless without the crowd. We cringed as we looked back to the sand bar after snorkeling an empty section of reef. I feel bad for those that think they have been to the City when they are surrounded by a hundred others. It's not the same. Starfish, snorkeling the reef and lunch on the water were icing on the cake. The service and staff were just as priceless. Book them!!",Date of experience: November 2014,Stingray City,1,Grand Cayman
Short hop to the park,"Nice hotel however we saw very little of it. Brass tax: free fast pass tickets and early entry to park. The hotel is great however the price of the pass and entry sells this resort. All three ""on site"" hotels empty out at 6am as ALL guests start the walk over to the park. Must stay!",Date of stay: June 2014,Loews Royal Pacific Resort,1,"Orlando, Florida"
Excellent seafood restaurant,"Great food, atmosphere, service. Great selection of quality seafood. Standby favorites with other creative dishes round out solid dinig experience. Probably the best fine seafood in a crab loving town.",Date of visit: October 2012,The Oceanaire Seafood Room,1,"Baltimore, Maryland"
Best Seafood Experience in Baltimore,"Oceanaire is very close second but Roys is our favorite. Yes the pineapple martinis definitely prime their rating! Excellent cuisine, creative dishes, impeccable service. If you love your meals in the Hawaiian islands you will be come back to Roys again and again.",Date of visit: October 2012,Roy's Restaurant,1,"Baltimore, Maryland"
It's the Capital Grille!,No other restaurant brand has been able to maintain as high of quality dining experience across their establishments!

"Ripped off Youth Soccer fundraiser!! Long Gate Ellicott City, MD","Bitter reviewer so consider the source. We ran fundraiser by providing a ton of traffic. We jammed the restaurant, take out and parking lot on a Wednesday night. We expected to receive a small percent of the revenue generated by having all our guests provide servers and cashiers with vouchers. They really shortchanged many children and parents. To long a story for review however trust that we were not being unreasonable. We appreciate their end of running a business. We will never again be a source of revenue for them. Their behavior and judgement motivates all families involved to enthusiastically boycott their restaurant. Principle over pizza.",Date of visit: October 2012,Uno Pizzeria & Grill,1,"Baltimore, Maryland"
Soccer central,"We had a great experience during our soccer tournament in Gettysburg. It was comforting to know we had a safe, clean, amenity filled gathering location as we criss crossed the town shuttling our soccer team. The boys loved the pool, restaurant and rooms. The adults enjoyed the mini lobby bar that preserved our sanity. Good times for all!",Date of stay: May 2012,Hilton Garden Inn Gettysburg,1,"Gettysburg, Pennsylvania"
