Fantastic!,"We had a wonderful time. We appreciated a schedule change to avoid bad weather as we were really excited about the trip. It was just the two of us and one family, so it felt very relaxed and private, unlike a party boat. We do recommend avoiding bringing small children. As others have said, the crew were very happy and helpful, and also flexible around our requests. The pace was relaxed but never dull, and we had plenty of stops for sightseeing and swimming. Fresh fish for lunch at sea is unforgettable. Overall a fantastic way to spend a day and see Milos, and it was also very reasonably priced. Absolutely recommend you do this while you stay in Milos!",Date of experience: August 2019,Explore Milos with PoseidonÂ®,5,"Milos, Greece"
