Best Fishing trip ever!!,"This was such an amazing day!! More thanks to Yanis and Nancy who are the owners of the boat and the first ones to offer a fishing trip in Samos than anything else ️ They gave us a feeling it was our own boat since the moment we met.

All day long they make sure you are having fun, taking you on the boat to the best fishing spots and teaching you how to fish if needed. We were lucky to catch many of them. All of us.
When fishing was over we parked at the most amazing Bay with water so clear I was sure you only get to see in the Bahamas some jumped in and I was happy Yanis let me help him clean the fish :)

We talked and made jokes all day, cooked the amazing fish we caught wish some fresh bread salad and white wine and couldn’t be happier on our way back. We made new friends and had such a good experience

I would go a million times more !",Date of experience: July 2019,Samos Fishing Trips,5,"Samos, Greece"
