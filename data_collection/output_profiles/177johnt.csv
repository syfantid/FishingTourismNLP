Mind boggling collection of local memorabilia and Naxos artifacts,"Passion on display; it's hard to imagine how Florios has found the time to create, compile and curate this collection of Naxos history! So many interesting pieces and Florios seems to have en encyclopedic knowledge of them all. Really glad we were directed here...the kind of place that you won't realize how much you would have missed out on - until you go and see it. Kaloxilos village is very cool as well, and if you are here then the folklore museum cannot be missed! Keep up the outstanding work!",Date of experience: June 2019,Folklore Museum Florios Chorianopoulos,5,"Naxos, Greece"
Captain Anthia and crew are the real deal. What a great experience!!,"This is not so much as fishing trip (there are plenty of places around the world to do that...Santorini is not really high on the list) as it is an extremely authentic commercial fishing boat experience. Pulling up the ~800 meters of nets and a few dozen traps, learning about each and every species that we caught, and having a literal fresh feast was amazing. Not something you get to do in many places.
We were a family of four (kids 22, 25) and all agreed that it was a true highlight of our trip to Greece.
The handlining, snorkeling, and sightseeing along the coast were a nice bonus, but the real gem in this outing is Captain Anthi and her crew. Seeing them manage their traditional fishing boat and hearing her passion about her family and her lifestyle made this a truly memorable outing. The very best Santorini has to offer.",Date of experience: June 2019,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Outstanding and authentic experience! A real gem on Naxos.,"Our time chatting and cooking with Katerina and Maria ended up being one of the true highlights of our family trip. With all of the spectacular scenery, beaches and culture we saw, our time at Vioma was at the top of our list...what a special experience she has created! Friendly, informative, funny and truly relaxing way to spend a half day. Very highly recommended...our kids (22, 25) enjoyed every minute...we wish it could have been an even longer day! Kaloxilos was a really sweet village as well - very cool.",Date of experience: June 2019,Vioma,5,"Naxos, Greece"
Perfect food tour with an exceptional guide! Way better than expected.,"George was fantastic. What a great way to wander through the neighborhoods, learning not only about the excellent cuisine and tasting great stuff, but also a bit of culture, history, and cool facts about Athens. Never felt rushed and never a dull moment.
We received recommendations about what to try not only during our stay in Athens but also on our trip out to the islands we visited afterwards. We were a family of 4 (kids in their 20's) and everyone absolutely loved this tour. Bravo George!",Date of experience: June 2019,Flavors of Athens private food tour,5,"Athens, Greece"
"2 tours - great pace, great value and excellent presentation","Rich provided us two tours; both were presented with very small group sizes despite Rome being very busy and crowded (as it deserves to be!). The Ancient Rome tour hits all of the highlights you would expect; this being our third visit to Rome I did not expect to gain so much new and very interesting knowledge on places I had visited and learned about previously. The Vatican/Sistine/St Peters tour would seem to be a no-brainer decision for anyone even considering visiting these key sites given the long non-tour queue waiting to get in. Again, the art history and architectural perspective Rich brought to this tour was greatly interesting to us, as well as our High School and College aged children.

Rich keeps a fast pace but ensures the group is keeping up and progressing comfortably; no trudging and following a huge group here! This is very important in that it allowed us to see and learn as much as possible during the tours, without feeling like we skipped key features and sites.

His pre-trip communication and coordination was top-notch. Great value, Highly recommended.",Date of experience: June 2013,Rome Day Tours with Rich Brunn,5,"Rome, Italy"
