Lovely relaxing day for the family,"Took my two teenage boys on the trip. They were fascinated by the extensive catch from the nets, all sorts of fish and seafood - including a flying fish, stingray, lobsters etc. We swam off the boat at a couple of beautiful beaches and enjoyed a wonderful meal. The hospitality was fantastic, very friendly and warm. Highly recommended!",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
