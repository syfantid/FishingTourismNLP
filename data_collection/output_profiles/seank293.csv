Fantastic day,"This is a fabulous day out, fishing snorkelling and getting to see Poros in another way.
Captain Giannis is a great host and nothing is to much trouble.This was definitely one of the highlights of our trip and we would highly recommend to families or individuals,thanks again Captain Giannis for a fantastic day.",Date of experience: July 2019,Poseidon Fishing Trips,4,"Poros, Greece"
Great hotel with perfect location.,"My wife and I stayed here for two weeks at the end of june 2014.We had one of the front facing rooms with balcony that overlooked harbourside and Galatas. Views were fantastic . Rooms are modern ,clean and comfortable and are cleaned on daily basis. The balcony is a great addition because you can sit in the evening with a glass of wine and watch all the yachts and people go by. The staff are all friendly and are very welcoming especially George the manager who can speak very good English and will help you with any problem that you may come across .The location of the hotel is fabulous ,right in the centre of Poros with all the restaurants and bars in walking distance. Poros is a beautiful island and a great place to chill and relax. This hotel is a great place to stay.
