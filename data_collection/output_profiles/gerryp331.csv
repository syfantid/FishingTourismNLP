Awesome Day on the Sea!,We had a fantastic day on the sea with Antonia and Michalis and their wonderful daughter Nikki who entertained our young children. Coffee and cake in the morning followed by a delicious homemade lunch right on the boat! Swimming in the crystal clear waters was an extra special treat!! Definitely recommend this trip to experience an authentic day on the sea with a great Greek family!!,Date of experience: June 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
