Excellent tea factory tour,Came here in a group of 5 adults today for a tea factory tour. Rajha was an excellent guide - very informative and engaging. Able to tour all of the factory - hands on experience. Would highly recommend.,Date of experience: September 2018,Halpewatte Tea Factory,1,"Ella, Sri Lanka"
Excellent boat trip,"Can highly recommend our boat trip around Skiathos and Skopelos. Our skipper/guide, Dim, went above and beyond to make sure we had a great day. We stopped multiple times - all stunning locations - and even saw dolphins in the late afternoon. Delicious food with croissants, seafood and fruit, plus ice-cold waters and wine. The boat was simple but a good size for seven of us.",Date of experience: July 2018,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Unmissable in Darjeeling!,"We had an absolutely delightful afternoon at the Estate. We found it quite easily (a pleasant 20 minute walk from the centre of town, with very helpful people giving us directions along the way).

We were met there by a lovely lady who explained many different varieties of teas (e.g fist flush, second flush, green, white, etc.). The lady also talked us through the process of tea production, as the factory was not in production at that time. We were also given a cup of the Estate's finest tea, which was amazing, and a tour through the plantation.

Overall, we believe a visit to Darjeeling is incomplete without seeing Happy Valley Tea Estate.",Date of experience: January 2013,Happy Valley Tea Estate,1,"Darjeeling, India"
This place made our trip in so many ways!,"Peace Eye Guesthouse went above and beyond to make our experience in Nepal absolutely unforgettable. The accommodation is excellent, with very clean rooms, 24 hour hot showers, free wifi and great laundry service. More importantly, the staff are amazing!

On arrival, we were met by Davendra who is incredible at his job. We told him that we wanted to organise a ten day trek (ABC) and within hours, he had it sorted. Not only did he give us a quote that was far better than that of Kathmandu Guesthouse, he also paired us with an extremely experienced guide, named Yam. Davendra took care of permits, transport and gave us assistance with packing (as we were totally unprepared for trekking). Davendra also organised our paragliding and bike hire.

As a side note, if you are organising a trek in the Annapurna region, we would highly recommend Yam as a fantastic guide. He also went above and beyond.",Date of stay: February 2013,Peace Eye Guest House,1,"Pokhara, Nepal"
A perfect place to stay in Darjeeling,"After reading mixed reviews on this hotel, we arrived with minimal expectations. However, our experience could not have been better. Right from the beginning we had a fantastic time at this little sanctuary. We had excellent service across all aspects, from in-room service for breakfast to hot water bottles and tea at night. Furthermore, our room was beautifully presented and spotlessly clean, with lovely white linen and a huge bathroom. We highly recommend Shangrila.",Date of stay: January 2013,Shangri-la Regency,1,"Darjeeling, India"
Amazing guest house,My cousin and I stayed here for three nights and had an amazing experience. We thoroughly enjoyed the roof-top restaurant and the location. We also loved the well-presented rooms with great hot water. We would not hesitate to recommend this place to any of our family or friends.,Date of stay: January 2013,Nukkad Guest House,1,"Udaipur, India"
Highly recommend hotel,"The roof-top restaurant is the standout at this hotel. We loved everything about it, from the service to the food to the view of scores of kites in the sky. The service was absolutely amazing. We received excellent travel advice from the staff and they also organized a wonderful and very worthwhile trip out of town. The rooms are good, with comfortable beds and spacious bathrooms. Everest is also exceptionally clean. We also appreciated the transfer car from Ajmer, with a very safe driver.",Date of stay: January 2013,Hotel Everest,1,"Pushkar, India"
"Worst experience in India, serious safety concerns","We recently stayed here for one night and we can easily say that it was our worst experience in India. We had several superficial problems: no hot water, a dirty room with someone else's used towels and rubbish left behind. However, deeper problems emerged quite quickly. One staff member was very keen (actually pushy and insistent) to take us to the roof top late at night to show us the sights. He promised that he had work the next day so he couldn't show us in the morning. We were very tired so declined but awoke the next morning to find him sitting in the reception area. What he thought he could show us in the darkness, we are unsure. More than that - and the reason we left - we were woken in the middle of the night by two Indian men trying to break into our room. When we stirred, they left. We are not sure if these people were staff but irrespective we think the managers neglected their role to secure the premises.

We are aware that there are a lot of positive reviews for this hotel so we can't say that our experience is indicative of the norm. At the same time, as two relatively young female travellers, we would actively discourage anyone from staying at Suraj Guest House.",Date of stay: January 2013,Suraj Guest House,1,"Varanasi, India"
