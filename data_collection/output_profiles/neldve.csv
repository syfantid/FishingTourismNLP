Best place to stay in Thassos,It is perfect apartment hotel with all needed utilities. The apartments are recently renewed and are extremely cosy and comfortable. From the balcony we had sea view and mountain view. Truelly amazing. For the hot days there is air-conditioner. We could park the car inside in the parking and it is great location - quiet and in close proximity to some of the most beautiful Thassos beaches and to the best tavernas in the island. It is very clean and the staff is very helpful with every request we had. Excellent place to stay with the family and friends. Thanks you for the great experience.,Date of stay: July 2019,Holiday Villa Thassos,1,"Thásos, Greece"

Not happy with the quality,The meat is strangely prepared. The souse is with weird spices. Too much curry. The prices are quite expensive for this quality.

I would expect better quality of service from such a hotel,"The cleanliness of the rooms was not optimal. I have found hair in the bath tube, which I find very disgusting. We have used the shower gels and they were never replaced. Neither any of the used other kits in the bathroom. The beds were well done but my pajamas were not folded but put on a ball next to the pillows. The breakfast was not rich on choice but the products selected were good. The hotel facilities are excellent and the rooms are very comfortable. The lift to the terms from inside the hotel was not working.",Date of stay: March 2016,"Radisson Blu Palace Hotel, Spa",1,"Spa, Belgium"
Horrible location,The location is outside anywhere. If you are there without a car cannot move.It is quite scary if it is dark. It is in the middle of the big shops and it is in between two parkings. I was scared to go out,Date of stay: April 2016,Hotel Chamdor,1,"Roeselare, Belgium"
