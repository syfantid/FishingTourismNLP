Amazing and Authentic Experience,"Captain Kyriakos is an authentic man and very joyful person and his daughter Tina was very kind.They are both very friendly and full of humor!! We went for fishing and caught many fishes!! Mr Kyriakos and his daughter Tina cooked the fishes and other tradiniotal greek dishes. They also provided delicious breakfast and fruits! The trip and the beaches we visited were amazing (Gerakas, Tsigkardo, Kleftiko) . The fishing trip is for maximum 10 persons therefore i suggest to book 2-3 days before. The most amazing and authentic experience!! Thank you so much Captain and Tina!",Date of experience: August 2020,Milos Fishing Trip,5,"Milos, Greece"
