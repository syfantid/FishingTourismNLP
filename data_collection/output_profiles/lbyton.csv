"Fantastic, just what we needed!!","Just returned from a two night stay at the Torcroft and it was so lovely! We both felt like it was really homely and it was little touches that made us feel extra looked after, like proper home comfort style mugs and the tea selection! Our room was so cutely decorated and the bed was so comfortable. The breakfasts were gorgeous, in particular the eggs benedict!! Phil and Sharon made us feel so welcome and were so chatty! We hadn’t stayed in a b&b before as we normally use hotels but this has totally changed our mindset, although probably given us high standards!!",Date of stay: September 2019,The Torcroft,4,"Torquay, United Kingdom"
Never fished before but this was so good!,"So my boyfriend was keen to go on a fishing trip and was absolutely buzzing about this trip. I originally was not so much....but I took a sea sickness tablet and thought I’d give it a go!

We first set sail and it was a bit rocky but it was okay!
I was such a novice and struggled to catch anything at first but I caught one fish, so I was happy! My boyfriend and all the other members of the boat were catching loads, including puffer fish (which you cant eat but are nice to see!) it was so calm sat on the sea under the shaded canopy.

The team were always around to give you any tips to help you!

After some time fishing we stopped off for snorkelling while the team cooked up what we had caught.

This was my highlight of the trip. Sitting looking out to the sea eating bbq fish caught and cooked within a couple of hours was amazing. The crew threw bread into the water to attract the fish and they were all jumping out of the water.

Beers and soft drinks were available and offered throughout. It was lovely sat at the front of the boat with a cold beer staring out into the sea!

My boyfriend came away saying it was definitely his highlight and I’ve got to say I would definitely do it again too!

Thanks to the whole team!
We even recommended you guys to a couple back at the hotel!",Date of experience: June 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
What an amazing last day in Rhodes!,"I had seen reviews on tripadvisor before I went and was so keen to go on this trip. I was not disappointed! Myself and my boyfriend were allocated our own big bean bag to chill on whilst we sailed on our trip. All throughout we were served cool wine, and beers were sitting in ice for us to help ourselves to. Whilst we stopped off for swimming our lunch was made and it was so tasty! Fresh mussels with garlic, chicken and Greek salad etc etc. We felt so well looked after, honestly we felt like celebrities sailing around on the med as we laid in the sun being served drinks and given food! The music was also such a nice touch. We set sail in the morning to “perfect day!”, it was so relaxing and we came back into the harbour (after the drinks had been flowing) to the whole boat doing the YMCA!!

I just want to do it all over again!
Thanks you to the whole team!

Can’t praise it enough!,"From the moment we arrived we just felt so looked after, everyone was friendly and somebody took our bags to our rooms. The food was excellent and so varied - we aren’t fussy eaters so we ate everything - from freshly cooked seafood to steaks etc. We loved having fresh paella everyday! The table service for drinks in the evening at the main entertainment was fantastic and a particularly nice touch, we were so well looked after. Everywhere in the hotel was spotless and we never had issues getting sunbeds. We also liked that the entertainment throughout the day was well advertised but not pressured into joining in like you normally get!We have just come back and one day it did rain, however the hotel are so great with kids they put on a family day for them with bouncy castles and zipwires for them so they weren’t bored!!We were pretty much the only English guests but we didn’t mind, all the entertainment team are multi-lingual and it was so impressive! The evening entertainment was probably the best I’ve had from an all inclusive resort, from magicians to acrobats. The drinks menu for an all inclusive was amazing, with branded drinks and even the champagne cocktail was included in the package. We just thought this hotel was great. The only issue was that the hotel was quite remote however there was a local bus service just outside the hotel, however you don’t get the free bus services to the main attractions in Majorca as you are so far out.",Date of stay: September 2018,Blau Punta Reina Family Resort,4,"Majorca, Spain"
