An unforgettable experience,"We spent the day with Efi and Dimitrios celebrating our daughters 16th birthday and it was an amazing day that we will never forget. Efi and Dimitrios are wonderful, friendly people who make everyone feel really welcome. We started the trip with coffee and bread and Efi's homemade apricot marmalade, which was delicious. We also saw Adonis the turtle in Katelios harbour, my children were absolutely thrilled. Then we went to the fishing grounds, it was so interesting learning about all the different fish. Efi cooked an amazing lunch with our catch which all of us thoroughly enjoyed. We also had several swimming stops at fabulous beaches. If you come to Kefalonia and want to do something amazing and unforgetable go and spend the day with Efi and Dimitrios, you won't be disappointed.",Date of experience: July 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
