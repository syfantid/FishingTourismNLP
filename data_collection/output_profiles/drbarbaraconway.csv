"What an amazing experience. We were welcomed by Effi, DImitri and Mohammad onto the fishing boat and the day began","We helped get in the 2 km nets and sort out the fish, including a lobster. We got to have 3 beautiful swims on deserted beaches including a brilliant beach with clay that made our skin feel re vitalised. Effi cooked a fantastic meal with the fish caught and my husband experienced lobster for the first time. We were made to feel welcome and all the people with us on the experience bonded and had a rare shared moment in paradise with turquoise seas and fun moments. A perfect day and perfect hosts, thank you DImitri, Efficient and Mohammad.",Date of experience: August 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
