A wonderful day out,"A day out with Effi&Dimi is a day I can recommend for everybody.You learn about Greek food, all the varieties of fish, help out with the nets and then Effi cooks them for you! And we vhere lucky not to only see seals but as we anchored close to them some passengers swam close to where we spotted them and then the seals came as close as 5 meters! It was a great day out!",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best end of our Italian holiday!,"Don't miss out on this restaurant if you are in Tellaro! We spent two evenings there and both times we just loved it.The restaurant has recently been re-decorated to a high standard, it's beautiful and has a personal feeling to it, also there is a wonderful garden.
The food is excellent. They serve what the see gives you that day and there are 3 menus but still one can mix and match which is very good. They only serve fish and its excellent, its pure but with a twist, like octopus with apple, great combination.
The warmth of the owner and his staff made our last day of a three weeks holiday in Italy the best end we could have, thank you for this. We will be back!",Date of visit: July 2017,Ristorante Il Fico Trentacareghe,5,"Tellaro, Italy"
Wondeful place,"We booked three nights but decided to stay one more night as we loved it so much. The owner is so friendly, he makes you feel so welcome and one really goes in to relax mode, nothing is too complicated. The rooms are very good value for the money and either has a balcony or a garden. The breakfast is very good as well. The village Tellaro is a small place and as the road ends in the village there are not so much traffic so its really quiet and does not feel so touristy and at the hotel there is a great restaurant,Il Fico, excellent food.
Cross over the street is the stairs to the beach and the bus stops outside the door so one can easily be there without a car.",Date of stay: July 2017,Albergo Blueline,5,"Tellaro, Italy"
