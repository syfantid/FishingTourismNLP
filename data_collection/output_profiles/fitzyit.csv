Excellent all round,"Called in earlier in the week to see if they could accommodate a party of 26. Obviously due to the current climate we were not hopeful but they said yes. All on individual family tables as required, no problem.
I can honestly say and speaking on behalf of our entire party we could not have been happier. All food was excellent even the children's meals and large portions all around. Everyone of us said the food was so tasty.
The meals did not all come out together but we knew that because of the size of party but it wasn't a problem.
The staff were all excellent and very friendly especially the main waitress ( young girl with dark hair - sorry did not catch her name) .
If in the area and looking for a good pub and food look no further.
We will certainly go back if around.",Date of visit: July 2020,The Globe Inn,1,"Looe, United Kingdom"
Only okay,Setting is fantastic. Place looks great but it has a down side. Staff not as nice as they could be and drinks more expensive than other places nearby. Why pay more for a drink when it's the same as everywhere else? Certainly places just as good around.,Date of visit: September 2019,Buca Lounge Bar,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Good bar,"Good bar if you want sports, music etc. There is a great selection of drinks and staff are very chatty and helpful. Always busy.",Date of visit: September 2019,Spikey's Sports Bar,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Great bar,"Great bar for drinks and people watching. Situated on the crossroads it is ideal. All the ladies in our party had cocktails which were reasonably priced and by all accounts lovely. The staff are so helpful and friendly.
It is not like Spikeys opposite which is good if you want sport or music etc, this place is more chilled.",Date of experience: September 2019,Jungle Bar Cafe,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Great restaurant.,"Great restaurant with a lovely setting near the beach. Very big menu but all food excellent. Staff very helpful. Highly recommended. We even had an earthquake while there but it added to the night.
Highly recommended.",Date of visit: September 2019,Taverna Asteria Est 1963,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Lovely restaurant.,"Lovely restaurant which I think some people miss because it is up the road from the crossroads. It only takes a few minutes but it is worth the walk. Worth booking as the people who know about it do go often. English lady at front was very helpful with our booking and helped us with picking seats. The food is delicious and a slightly different but good menu. Staff all good as were the drinks.
Recommended.",Date of visit: September 2019,Koukounari Pine Cone Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Not what I expected,"Was looking forward to it due to other reviews but as a party of 6 adults we were not impressed, Looks more like a cafe and the food was awful. Soup for starters was like packet soup and powdery. Some of the mains were only just edible, lamb chops were okay but had much better elsewhere. Compared to other restaurants in the area it was nowhere near as good.Service on average. The prices though were the same. I won't be going back. Do not know why it is so well liked I must be missing something.",Date of visit: September 2019,Paulos Corner,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Great steaks,"This was recommended to us as we wanted a good steak and it ticked all the boxes.
We had between us Fillet, sirloin and rib eye and everyone said theirs was excellent. There are lots of choices on the menu not just steak.
We had to book as it was busy so worth checking. Staff nice
Good location on main road.",Date of visit: September 2019,Nostos Taverna,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Lovely food,"Been to this restaurant on previous years and it is still just as good. Great selection on the menu and food always nice.Nice wine too. Staff very helpful and attentive. Always busy which is a good sign.
Just up from the main crossroads it is worth looking for.

Good restaurant,"Situated above a bar it may get overlooked but it is a nice restaurant. I had chicken in cream sauce which was really tasty.
Nice staff worth a visit.",Date of visit: September 2019,Al Fresco,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Best in Alykes,"My favourite in Alykes, just something about the place. Always worth booking as it does get busy. Staff seem to be 100 mph but that adds to the charm for me. The main thing though the food is really good and that's why we went again.
Do not walk past. If it's busy book for another night it is worth it.",Date of visit: September 2019,El Greco Authentic Greek Cuisine,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"

Great restaurant,"Most of the reviews have got it spot on. This is one of the best in the area with a fantastic and different menu, some really tasty meals not seen elsewhere.
Best to book but worth it.
Everything about the place is good.",Date of visit: September 2019,To Paradosiako Taverna,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Lovely,"Great restaurant to just sit by the sea and chill out. Went twice for lunch and only had basic stuff, salads, omelettes, baked potatoes etc but it was all nice.
The place seems to make changes every year to the surroundings but it keeps getting better.
Staff really nice.",Date of visit: September 2019,Porto Paradiso,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Best in Alykanas,"Really loved this restaurant. It is family run and not a ploy to get you in but the food was outstanding. Staff really helpful with changing things around to suit individual tastes. Good selection and everything we had was lovely. Lovely village wine with the meal including complimentary jug.
The only restaurant we visited twice which was unusual for us as we like to shop around but it was so good.
Only think it is low on TA is because it has not been open long and there used to be another restaurant here.
Highly recommended.",Date of visit: September 2019,HORIO Family Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Good restaurant,"Stopped here on are first night as we were tired and it was the first one we came too. Man on the front enticing people in which I do not like but we tried it anyway. Must say the food was excellent, service good and price reasonable. I had the lamb shank which was small but very tasty.
It is of the main road but not hard to find and well worth it.",Date of visit: September 2019,Elia Elia,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Great breakfast,"Only went of a day time for breakfast but can highly recommend it. If you want a full English this is very good and reasonably priced. Good staff very pleasant. There was a mix up with our bill having been paid by a previous customer but the girl on the till (blonde hair - sorry no name) sorted it.
Recommended.",Date of visit: September 2019,The Cosy Corner,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Fantastic food,"Great food in this restaurant. Quite a walk from our hotel but plenty of beer stops in between made it easier. The food was worth the walk. Six adults all said it was great. Pork chop to die for.
I would suggest booking as we were the last to get in and it was only 8pm lots of people got turned away.
Good value for money too.
Highly recommended.",Date of visit: September 2019,Vrisaki,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Nice bar,"Nice bar with apartments attached to it. The staff very helpful and friendly especially the young girl with long dark hair (sorry do not know name). Large selection of drinks at reasonable prices.
Did not eat here so can not comment on the food. People we spoke to said it was good and the apartments were very nice.
Worth going for a drink.",Date of visit: September 2019,Bonkers bar,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Good bar not a restaurant,Good bar right outside Alykanas Beach hotel. The choice of drinks/cocktails etc was very good and reasonably priced. The staff very pleasant. The is a range of entertainment from sport on TV to live music and other stuff. Worth going in to check it out we ended up here most nights for a nightcap.,Date of visit: September 2019,Dilemma Bar,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Good hotel,"The hotel is fine. The rooms are basic but large enough and spotless, the cleaners do an excellent job. The reception staff are very pleasant. The location is perfect for beach and also so close to Alykanas and Alykes town centres. Some of the previous complaints are a bit harsh. All in all a good hotel.
Now that Thomas Cook has gone and Tui taken over I hope it does not change too much only for the better.",Date of stay: September 2019,Alykanas Beach Grand Hotel by Zante Plaza,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Read the reviews then just book it.,"Booked our trip from the UK and everything was very easy.
Our original trip was cancelled due to adverse weather so Giorgos (captain) tried to fit us in at a later date. Called that morning saying he would have to cancel again due to weather. Rang me back about 2 hours saying although we were about 3 hours late would we still like to go but on a condensed trip as Giorgos did not want to let us down. We all agreed to go. Giorgos said the trip would not be as long as normal but we would get a feeling of what normally happened.
So glad we went, the best day of our holiday. The boat is absolutely spotless. After coffee Giorgos explained what we would do and explained all about fishing. So interesting and informative. We put nets out and went to an island with no one on it for swimming etc. Went back to collect nets, hoping we would get some fish, which we did. More swimming at a different beach while lunch was prepared.
Food was excellent and so tasty and also very plentiful.
All in all an excellent day we all agreed that if we return we would do it again but hope to get the full day in.
Can not recommend this trip enough, all crew and facilities first class.",Date of experience: September 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Excellent.,"The food in this place was outstanding. Also the staff very nice and helpful. The head waiter explained everything on the menu. Also the view when the sun goes down is fantastic.The best meal of our holiday and it was worth every penny although it wasn't expensive.
Seek it out it's worth it.",Date of visit: May 2019,Nafsika Taverna,1,"Corfu, Greece"
Excellent.,"Really good restaurant with a lovely owner. The food was fantastic. They have roast a pig/lamb every day we had lamb which was lovely. Went back a second time and just as good. We had a long wait for the food but we were in no rush and it was worth waiting for. Also our cheapest meal.
The place has only been open a few months but I am sure it will be a success.",Date of visit: May 2019,Mythos Restaurant,1,"Corfu, Greece"
Good for lunch.,Only went if for lunch but it was very nice. We had a sandwich and salad but they were very nice and reasonable. The view is fantastic. All staff very friendly.,Date of visit: May 2019,Havana Beach Bar,1,"Corfu, Greece"
Nice restaurant,Went our first night and had lovely food and drink (house wine). Decided to go later in the holiday and it was just as good. Food was great on both occasions.

Excellent,Called in first for a beer and got chatting to the waitress who was English. She was really nice and very helpful so we decided to go back the next night.

Not as good as others.,"Tried this restaurant as the reviews were ok but it was nowhere near as good as the other ones we tried. It was also the dearest, not quite sure why. Food was only so so. We may have caught it on a bad night but would not rush back there.",Date of visit: May 2019,Brusko Restaurant Cafe Bar,1,"Corfu, Greece"
Very good.,Very good restaurant. Food was excellent as was the service. All reasonably priced. If you are in the area try it out. There was also Greek dancing in the middle of the restaurant while you are eating.,Date of visit: May 2019,Zorbas,1,"Corfu, Greece"
Lovely Hotel,"Lovely hotel in a lovely village. 5 mins to the beach and 5 mins to the town. Rooms cleaned daily, towels changed regular. Facilities great. Best of all the staff all very friendly and helpful. I would certainly recommend it. Minor complaint the my bed was very hard but some people might like that and as I said only a minor complaint.
The hotel is up a hill and no good if you have walking difficulties but we found it okay.",Date of stay: May 2019,Kapetanios Apartments,1,"Corfu, Greece"
Great restaurant.,"Booked this well in advance of our trip as it came highly recommended. Could not fault it in any way. Food excellent and even looked fantastic on the plate. One of our group said the sauce was a bit rich on their food but that is down to choice.
Staff great in this quirky restaurant.
Highly recommended but suggest booking or you wont get in.",Date of visit: April 2019,Restauracja Starka,1,"Krakow, Poland"
Lovely food.,"Only went here as one of our party could not walk far due to accident and it was 2 mins from our hotel. Did not research it as it is so low on TA reviews. Should be much higher as food and service both excellent. Restaurant is bright and clean and staff very helpful.
Food and wine really nice. It may be low on reviews because it is not near the square but it is worth the walk.",Date of visit: April 2019,Sette,1,"Krakow, Poland"
Lovely food.,"Just returned from Krakow and ate here twice. Went first night which was excellent and because a lot of other restaurants were closed or fully booked as it was Easter Sunday went again.
First time burger and second time steak both really good especially the steak. All reasonably priced as well.
Staff really helpful and efficient despite it being very busy.

Great hotel.,"Second visit to this hotel and great again. Booked on a package so not the cheapest but worth it as the hotel go the extra mile to make your visit memorable. Only ate breakfast but the choice and quality is fantastic. All staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms very good ours had Castle view which was lovely. Location about 10 mins from mail square but a nice walk.
Highly recommended.",Date of stay: April 2019,Hotel Kossak,1,"Krakow, Poland"
Waste of money.,"Really disappointed in this Lounge. We have been to others that were fine but not this one. Only very small choice of food, not a sandwich available, apparently they do not do them now. Why? Pasta and sauce being the main choice and that was not brilliant. One of our party does not eat pasta and had to make do with just cheese and crackers. Salad did not look to good either.
Surely a selection of food should be the least offered with 2 or 3 main choices.
Drinks okay hence the 1 star but not everyone drinks alcohol and only go for food.
Will not bother again unless some changes are made.",Date of experience: April 2019,Escape Lounge - T2,1,"Ringway, United Kingdom"
Fantastic.,"Our second visit to the Panorama and can honestly say it was excellent, even better than last time. We took our friends along as first timers and they also loved it. The family, Mavra, Nikki and all the staff are really friendly and helpful.Nothing is too much trouble. If you have an issue let them know and it will be sorted. The whole complex is spotlessly clean, the cleaners do an excellent job. The Greek night is a must for all ages. The location is ideal for the beach and town center.
I read previous comments about favouritism towards returners and never encountered this at all. They will organise trips if you require any.
There is a laid back attitude from everyone but that's Greece all over and just what you want on holiday.
All in all highly recommended and I am sure we will be back along with 90% of the other guests.",Date of stay: September 2018,Panorama Studios Apartments,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
As good as ever,"Booked these apartments as a surprise for my wife's birthday. Having been before 4 times we knew what to expect and we were not let down.
The apartments, hosts and all round experience was excellent. Kevin and Sally will go out of their way to help with anything.
If you are thinking of Rhodes or Afandou in particular look no further.
I do not think it will be our last visit to these wonderful apartments.",Date of stay: June 2018,Afandou Village Apartments,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Lovely restaurant,"Absolutely love this restaurant. The food is always freshly prepared and so tasty. The whole family who own and run it are so nice and friendly, but a big shout out to Tsambika, the nicest waitress you could meet.
As mentioned all the food is lovely but especially the pasta dishes, but be warned they are big portions and after the free dough balls and garlic butter the main meals are a struggle.
Give it a try if in the area even worth driving too.",Date of visit: June 2018,Sergio's,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great value,Really have to give this place a try. The food is very tasty and also very reasonably priced. Never had a bad meal in here and been 5 times. Waitress was run off her feet but still kept smiling as was very polite.,Date of visit: June 2018,Four Seasons,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Excellent small traditional Greek restaurant,"Called in for a beer and got talking to a British couple who recommend we give it a try. So glad we did the food was a little different than normal and all freshly prepared. We tried a mixture of various starters and mains and they were so tasty not what you would expect.
The place is family run and they were so friendly even though the owner who is also the cook could not speak very good English, his wife tried to explain everything. The waitress who was not part of the family was also very nice and helpful.
We ended up going back another day as it was so nice.
Highly recommended if in the area.",Date of visit: June 2018,Gummersbach Traditional Kafeneio-Tsipouradiko,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
"Brilliant,same as always.","My favourite restaurant. So unlike other restaurants but the food is so nice. Theo the owner is a character but so nice, he will talk you through the food on offer and make suggestions. The prawns in Ouzo is the nicest starter I have ever had. All the food is highly recommended but you must try the home made chips. The place can be difficult to find but just ask a local it's worth it.",Date of visit: June 2018,Ouzeri o Thioris,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Lovely restaurant,"First time to this fairly new restaurant but do not think it will be the last. Tucked away down a street not far from the square we were recommended to go here by a local and it was well worth it. All the food was excellent and reasonably priced. Service also very good.
The decor of the restaurant was very good.
All in all I would certainly recommend you visit.",Date of visit: June 2018,To Karafaki,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great place,"Only a small place but gets very busy with locals so that says a lot. The menu is limited but there is enough choice for most people. Run by a Greek man and his English wife and both are really friendly and chatty.
The food is cooked mostly on a grill in front of you and the smells are delightful.
The lamb chops were the nicest I have had and also the home made chips are delightful.
The waitress, who I think is Polish was also very helpful making sure we did not order too much, she is also a bit nuts in a very nice way.
The price is very reasonable.",Date of visit: June 2018,Ouzadiko Spanos,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great bar,"We were recommended this bar by a local and it was really good. All drinks (beer, wine and spirits) were 4 zloty. The atmosphere was great and staff very pleasant.

Excellent,"Recently stayed here after booking through Jet2. Although you can book seperately. The hotel was excellent.Staff very friendly. Room was very clean and bed comfortable. Breakfast very good with lots of choice. Bar area fine. Location was about 10 mins walk to main square but that was far enough to be peaceful. Over looking the river and castle, so nice views when you wake up. Roof top bar also very nice with again great views. All in all as mentioned excellent, so much so we are looking to go back next year.",Date of stay: April 2018,Hotel Kossak,1,"Krakow, Poland"
Lovely place,The square is a beautiful place with lots of interesting buildings and sights. The are loads of bars / restaurants to choose from.

Highly recommended.,Date of experience: April 2018,Krakow Airport - Krakow City Private Transfer,1,"Krakow, Poland"
Excellent day.,"Booked this trip because of good reviews on TA and it could not be faulted. The driver/ guide Phil is English so no language problems. Phil also was very helpful and informative, he knows what he is talking about. Pick up was very prompt and drop off back at our hotel. We paid for a packed lunch which was also good.

Interesting day,"We did not book a tour but just organised a taxi to take us there and pick us up. When we arrived bought our tickets and waited for the next English speaking tour.

Our guide was very good.",Date of experience: April 2018,Wieliczka Salt Mine,1,"Wieliczka, Poland"
Excellent Steak,"Lovely steak restaurant, food was fantastic if you like steak. All our party had steak so not sure what anything else was like.
Service was good but they did try to get us to buy a dearer bottle of wine than the one we picked (house), but the one we chose was excellent and half the price to the one suggested.
All in all though a nice restaurant that is highly recommended.",Date of visit: April 2018,Ed Red,1,"Krakow, Poland"

Nice wine to accompany the meal. About 5 mins from main square so easy enough to find. Recommended.",Date of visit: April 2018,Morskie Oko,1,"Krakow, Poland"
Very nice restaurant,"Only went in here because we could not get in another one nearby, but as a second choice it was really nice. I had the pork which was lovely. The food, drinks and staff were all very good. Definitely recommend this restaurant although its a bit out the way.",Date of visit: April 2018,Tbilisuri Restauracja Gruzinska,1,"Krakow, Poland"
Only ok,"Went in here after being told how good it was by the owner who was outside, but found the food only so-so. I ordered chicken kebabs and rice hoping they would come together but the kebabs came about 10/15mins before the rice. I tried to keep them warm but never had much success also the rest of our group said the food was on ok. The owner was too busy telling us about all his other ventures that he runs from the restaurant than concentrating on the food.
I would not put anyone off as it was clean and they were nice people but I think they need to have more focus on satisfying the dining customers needs.",Date of visit: September 2017,Lacheln Restaurant,1,"Mui Ne, Vietnam"
Very good,"The restaurant is not easy to find but well worth it. It is in the middle of apartments up an alley off the main road.The tables are all around the pool area but you have a good view looking out over the town towards the ocean.
The food was very good, I had Thai curry which was really nice and my friends also liked all of their food.
The service was good and the cost very cheap.",Date of visit: September 2017,Breeze Restaurant & Bar,1,"Ham Tien, Vietnam"
Excellent,"Really nice restaurant on the main road so good we went twice. The whole place is nice and the service fantastic. A good selection of food,some unusual dishes and also nice beers / wine.
It is not cheap by Vietnam prices but well worth the money and still cheaper than the average place in the UK.
Highly recommended.",Date of visit: September 2017,Ratinger Löwe,1,"Phan Thiet, Vietnam"

The place is very clean and has good service also the price was very reasonable.",Date of visit: September 2017,Good Morning Vietnam Italian Restaurant Pizzeria,1,"Mui Ne, Vietnam"
Great day,"Booked this trip after reading reviews on TA. We wanted to go anyway and the thought of going early and missing the majority of other tourists appealed to us. It was a good decision as everything was great, from the hotel pick right through to drop off at the end. The guide was excellent and very informative and the tour itself was fantastic, really good to see what was experienced by the people involved.
The trip itself was very quick and relaxing with plenty of soft drinks supplied as well as food.All in all highly recommended. There may be cheaper tours available but this one was very professionally run.",Date of experience: September 2017,Half-Day Cu Chi Tunnels from Ho Chi Minh City by Luxury Speedboat,1,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"
Good but harrowing,A really must do on visiting HCM and well worth the entrance fee. The museum is well laid out and not too big but you can spend a long time there taking everything in. Some sights / pictures are really harrowing but well worth viewing. Highly recommended.,Date of experience: September 2017,War Remnants Museum,1,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"
Excellent,"We chose this hotel quite late as our previous one chosen had complications so we were a bit unsure what to expect. We did not have time to do much research on it but it seemed okay so decided to give it a go.We could not have been more pleased. The hotel is spotlessly clean (cleaning staff are so nice) the pool area lovely and it is right on the beach. Our room was 50 mtrs from the pool but most rooms are close to it as the hotel is not massive and is only on 2 levels. All the staff were very friendly and helpful.
A couple of points I feel would make this hotel even better and it does not detract from it in any way.
1) The rooms could have a safe in them. At present you have to leave valuables in reception in small lockers. I am sure they are safe but it is an inconvenience traipsing back and forth.
2) The breakfast selection was not very big, although it was okay it could do with upgrading to accommodate different cultures. Also a proper toaster would be great.
3) The bar area does not seem to be open of an afternoon or evening and although we could get a drink in the afternoon there was nothing available of an evening. I think they are missing out as I am sure (like us) it would be nice to sit of an evening and watch the sunset and listen to the ocean and also get to meet other guests.
These are only minor points and I would not put anyone off going there.",Date of stay: September 2017,Four Oceans Resort,1,"Phan Thiet, Vietnam"
Great hotel,"Went to this hotel for 5 nights as part of a package booked for us by our travel agent. Having read some of the reviews we were a bit apprehensive but could not have been more pleased had we booked it ourselves. The hotel was in a great location, the hotel and rooms were very clean and the staff were so nice and helpful. Only ate breakfast in the hotel which had plenty of choice and was really good. We also used the rooftop pool which was also good, yes its small but was fine for a quick dip and cool off. The rooftop bar was also nice of an evening where you can look out over the city. No complaints from our party of 4 adults and would recommend this establishment to all.",Date of stay: September 2017,EdenStar Saigon Hotel & Spa,1,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"
Lovely steaks.,"Had to try this restaurant as one of our party is a steak fanatic and it looked to be cheaper than South American steakhouses in the area. It is a little bit hard to find but well worth it.
We hadn't booked they managed to fit 4 of us in although it was very busy. The steak was worth going for absolutely gorgeous also the beers were different and nice. Very good service too. The meal was expensive for Vietnam but still cheaper than the UK. Recommended.
Follow directions on TA for the location and would advise booking to be sure of a table.",Date of visit: September 2017,B3 Steakhouse & Craft beer,1,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"
Nice Italian,"Checked out a few Italian restaurants on TA and decided on this one and think we made a good choice.

Nice restaurant,Only went to this restaurant as it was our first night and was close to our hotel but it was really nice. We had starters and a mixture of Tapas which were all lovely. The lady in charge (not sure if manager or owner) was really nice and helpful and helped us with our choice ensuring we did not over order. The bill was very reasonable.,Date of visit: September 2017,MZ Coffee Restaurant,1,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"
Good day out,"Read some of the reviews so decided to give it a go. We were 4 ( older ) adults and were unsure what to expect. What we got was a fun packed, enjoyable day out. The guide (sorry can't remember his name) was very helpful, informative and a really friendly man. The food was nice and the wine cheap and very nice and plentiful with Spiro topping up the glasses as we due to leave. All in all a good day and we also met some very nice people. Recommended.",Date of experience: June 2017,Trainaki,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Lovely setting,"Only went of a daytime for snacks and drinks but everything was great. Food, service and food all excellent but the setting is ideal for just chilling and watching the world go by. We called in for a drink of an evening just to chill and it was lovely. Worth trying",Date of visit: June 2017,Porto Paradiso,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Good but not great,"Went for an evening meal as 4 adults. My own meal was fine but 2 of our party ordered stuffed burger which both said was over cooked, also the other party member ordered lamb steak/chop which was also over cooked. In fairness to the staff they did offer to replace the meals but by then we had eaten starters and sides off the main so did not require the meals replacing. They then knocked 10% off the bill which was nice.
I would not put anyone off going as it was very busy. Maybe we were just unlucky with our choice of meals. I must say that the staff were all very good.",Date of visit: June 2017,Fidelio Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Lovely food,Lovely food in a lovely restaurant. All meals we had were nice and drinks too. It was very busy and we were lucky to get in (4 adults) but I know they take bookings so I would advise it if you want to be assured of getting a table. All service good.,Date of visit: June 2017,To Paradosiako Taverna,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Seek it out it's worth it.,"This restaurant is on the far side of the salt flats so probably gets missed by some people but it is worth finding.
The main waitress was fantastic and also very chatty and nice. The menu is enormous big enough for all tastes and the food is excellent.

Good but expensive,Went on our first night and although the food was very nice it turned out to be the most expensive meal of our holiday.

Worth looking for.,This restaurant is up the road past Iris bar (only a few minutes on opposite side) but worth looking for. The setting is very nice in the open air and the food was lovely.

Excellent - can not fault it.,"Recently returned from a 10 day break at these apartments and as I have said we as a group of 4 adults could not fault it. As has been said by others the whole complex and apartments etc are spotlessly clean. The facility's are great, lovely pool, plenty of sunbeds, food also lovely and only 5 minutes from the beach, 5 minutes from the town but far enough away to be quiet at night.
The main thing as has been mentioned by most people is the helpful friendly and just all round niceness of all the staff but especially Mavra and Niki nothing was too much trouble.
We spoke to lots of different guests and there seems to be lots of repeaters who go back time after time, which is always a good sign.
I am sure we will be back at the Panorama soon and are already looking at next years holiday.

The food was fantastic all of us had a starter and then a variety of different steaks and by all accounts every one was perfect. Two of our group had dessert the rest were full up. We had drinks which consisted of beers and wines and the total bill was very good. Can not remember the exact amount but I know we compared it to a number of South American steak houses and ours was much cheaper.

Excellent,"We chose this hotel quite late as our previous one chosen had complications so we were a bit unsure what to expect. We did not have time to do much research on it but it seemed okay so decided to give it a go.We could not have been more pleased. The hotel is spotlessly clean (cleaning staff are so nice) the pool area lovely and it is right on the beach. Our room was 50 mtrs from the pool but most rooms are close to it as the hotel is not massive and is only on 2 levels. All the staff were very friendly and helpful.
A couple of points I feel would make this hotel even better and it does not detract from it in any way.
1) The rooms could have a safe in them. At present you have to leave valuables in reception in small lockers. I am sure they are safe but it is an inconvenience traipsing back and forth.
2) The breakfast selection was not very big, although it was okay it could do with upgrading to accommodate different cultures. Also a proper toaster would be great.
3) The bar area does not seem to be open of an afternoon or evening and although we could get a drink in the afternoon there was nothing available of an evening. I think they are missing out as I am sure (like us) it would be nice to sit of an evening and watch the sunset and listen to the ocean and also get to meet other guests.
These are only minor points and I would not put anyone off going there.",Date of stay: September 2017,Four Oceans Resort,1,"Phan Thiet, Vietnam"
Great hotel,"Went to this hotel for 5 nights as part of a package booked for us by our travel agent. Having read some of the reviews we were a bit apprehensive but could not have been more pleased had we booked it ourselves. The hotel was in a great location, the hotel and rooms were very clean and the staff were so nice and helpful. Only ate breakfast in the hotel which had plenty of choice and was really good. We also used the rooftop pool which was also good, yes its small but was fine for a quick dip and cool off. The rooftop bar was also nice of an evening where you can look out over the city. No complaints from our party of 4 adults and would recommend this establishment to all.",Date of stay: September 2017,EdenStar Saigon Hotel & Spa,1,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"
Lovely steaks.,"Had to try this restaurant as one of our party is a steak fanatic and it looked to be cheaper than South American steakhouses in the area. It is a little bit hard to find but well worth it.
We hadn't booked they managed to fit 4 of us in although it was very busy. The steak was worth going for absolutely gorgeous also the beers were different and nice. Very good service too. The meal was expensive for Vietnam but still cheaper than the UK. Recommended.

Good but not great,"Went for an evening meal as 4 adults. My own meal was fine but 2 of our party ordered stuffed burger which both said was over cooked, also the other party member ordered lamb steak/chop which was also over cooked. In fairness to the staff they did offer to replace the meals but by then we had eaten starters and sides off the main so did not require the meals replacing. They then knocked 10% off the bill which was nice.
I would not put anyone off going as it was very busy. Maybe we were just unlucky with our choice of meals. I must say that the staff were all very good.",Date of visit: June 2017,Fidelio Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"

We asked to reserve a table due to a birthday celebration and to say they went out of their way would be an understatement, everything was perfect, from the table decoration right through to the cake (which was not asked for) but was a lovely touch.
A big thank you to all the staff as Sergio's, including father, mother and son, all lovely people and running a restaurant how it should be but most of all to Tsambika their daughter and waitress, one of the nicest persons you could meet who excels every time.

We were a party of 6 adults and had a free starter of dough balls and garlic bread all had a main course and lots of drinks inc. beer and a couple of carafes of wine and it all cost less than 70 euros.

Been on about 6 previous occasions but went again twice in 2 weeks. As previously mentioned there is no menu as such although one does exist but Theo the owner will just ask you what you want. If you want something different let him know in advance and he will get it for you.

Service really nice as well.",Date of visit: September 2016,Michalis Restaurant Cafe Bar,1,"Rhodes, Greece"

The food was really good and so tasty, I had mixed grill which was lovely but so big, no way I could finish it all.

Great Steaks,"Went here as we all (6 adults) fancied steak and where we were staying there was none available. While looking at the menu outside I was spoken to by a gentleman who I now think was the owner but he was really very friendly and not pushy at all. After consulting my friends we all decided to give it a try as it is a very clean and lovely looking restaurant.
The food did not disappoint 6 meals, 4 different cuts of steak some with chips salad etc some with potatoes veg etc all excellent.

We tried one of the taverna's which was good and reasonable",Date of experience: September 2016,Agathi Beach,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Excellent resort,"Recently got back from 2 weeks holiday in Asterias and would highly recommend it. The hotel is excellent for cleanliness, location and facilities. Hersonisos is 20 min walk down hill but there is a courtesy bus 3 times a day.
The staff were all fantastic and could not be more helpful. We asked to change room (for personal reasons) and it was sorted the next day. The pool is lovely, large in size and very clean, also loads of sunbeds. There was a bit of a problem with people reserving beds and not using them but that was sorted.
Just up steps (yes there are lots but it keeps you active) and either turn left for Koutouloufari or right for Piskopiano and Old Hersonisos all excellent places for restaurants bars and the odd shop. When you turn right for Piskopiano beware of the owner of the first restaurant you come to (100 yards from hotel) as he became a pest trying to get us to eat/drink in his restaurant, so much that we refused to go in there because of him. One family who were in our party were suckered in by him and said it was no good anyway.
All in all a great place to stay and I would have give it 5 stars but for a few minor points:
Firstly there was nothing going on especially at night to keep you there. In our 2 weeks there was 1 night when there was 2 men singing and on guitar etc who were very good and the bar area was really busy. After that nothing.It did not bother us too much as we were out any way but people with young families could do with some entertainment, a disco for children then adults would be great and it would also keep them at the hotel.
Secondly the price of drinks in the bar. 3.5 euros for a beer was ok but it was 5 euros for a large lemonade. Other drinks were also dear.
The management insist you can not bring your own drinks to the pool even though you can buy them at the supermarket opposite (which I believe is owned by the hotel) Make them more reasonably priced then or let people bring their own.
These point are only minor and could easily be changed but I would still go back to Asterias and would not put any one going.",Date of stay: July 2016,Asterias Village Resort,1,"Crete, Greece"
Deserves its place as No1,"Went to Alchemist twice and was very impressed. First time homemade burgers very nice, second time pork shank, absolutely enormous and very nice too.

Okay but there are better.,"The man at the front of house does a good job of getting you in showing the days specials how its cooked in the oven etc, but we felt once we were in the service was not as good as other restaurants and they did not show any interest or attention to customers. It is busy probably because of its location and the food is all okay and worth trying but shop around and don't be fooled to rush in.",Date of visit: July 2016,Emmanuel Taverna,1,"Crete, Greece"
Very good,"Went there twice, once as 2 x couples and once as a large family group and both times it was excellent. Food is traditional Greek but they do other stuff too. All our party enjoyed it. Service is second to none but be careful with the free Raki it goes down too easy.
Location is great in the middle of town by the wishing well on an elevated position so the views are good. Prices very reasonable.
One of the better restaurants in Koutou.",Date of visit: July 2016,Steki Restaurant,1,"Crete, Greece"

So glad we did as all 4 adults in our party thought it was the best restaurant in our 2 week holiday. From the moment we went in the service was fantastic, we were looking at the decorations displays around the place when we were invited to look into the kitchen which was spotless.
The food was all fabulous topped off by free Raki and free desert from a choice of about 12 all brought out to the table and very reasonable too.

The service also excellent and the lady from the front takes time to speak to everyone.
Highly recommended and good choice.",Date of visit: July 2016,Patriko,1,"Crete, Greece"
Excellent all round,"Went twice as first time was excellent. Ordered greek platter for 2 for me and my wife but we could not finish it. It comes with a large Greek salad so if you have this do not have a starter or they will have to roll you out.
The next time I opted for house special pasta dish which was also lovely, our friends had take away pizza and they said it was lovely.
The waiter was very friendly but good at his job and very slick.
Highly recommended as the menu is also very varied so something to please everyone. Reasonable in price.",Date of visit: July 2016,Ariadni,1,"Crete, Greece"
Not impressed,"Went here as its advertised as oldest in the village and looked ok but we were very disappointed. The setting is nice on the roof terrace but the food just was not as good as other restaurants in the area. Also smaller portions and larger prices than elsewhere.
Up to you to try it out as we may have ordered wrong but I had lamb kleftico which is a greek standard but we were disappointed as all 4 different meals were the same",Date of visit: July 2016,Pithari,1,"Crete, Greece"
Excellent,"Went here on a Monday night to watch the Greek night as it was recommended by a bar owner in Piskopiano. We went a few days before to book as we required a number of tables. Necessary to book as there was not a spare seat anywhere.
The food was excellent as was the service. The show in the square is also good.
Only complaint, the bill was quite large but this was mostly because of drinks. They do not do a house wine and the rest started at 15 euros a bottle also other drinks more expensive. I suppose you are paying for the entertainment.
Would definitely go again but maybe on another night as we have now seen the show.",Date of visit: August 2016,Sofas Taverna,1,"Crete, Greece"

There was no wardrobe as such but as we were only there for a few days we managed easily. I notice that a few people have previously complained about the breakfast but what do they expect for the money the hotel charges.

Great food and service,"Been to Sergio's previously so new what to expect and it keeps on giving. The food is always first rate, I normally get a pasta dish but our party of 6 all chose different and all were good. The portions are big so be careful. I have read previous reviews where people complained about the service. I don't know what happened to them but from our point of view the service is excellent. The main waitress, Tsambika, remembered us from last time and always goes out of her way to talk and ensure everything is ok. Highly recommended.",Date of visit: August 2015,Sergio's,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Superb food and service.Great atmosphere.,"Went on a Sunday and as it was suggested to us that it may be busy we took a chance, so glad we did. The whole place was full, mostly Greek families which says a lot and we were unsure if we would get in but as it was early evening I think a lot of families had been and gone. We were seated out doors as was everyone because it was so hot but the place had a great laid back atmosphere. The food was first rate. Our party 5 adults all shared a mixture of starters all very nice. For mains I had Moussaka but was struggling to finish, when I looked around we were all the same. Maybe go easy on the starters next time but they are so nice. After our meal we just sat with a few glasses of lovely wine and chilled out. It was a lovely evening all told. Highly recommended. Not sure if they take bookings but as Sunday afternoon gets very busy recommend early evening.",Date of visit: September 2015,Katholiki,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Afandou's best secret,"Went again as last year was so good, this time taking friends with us. Theo ask what you would like and prepares everything fresh. All the food is so good it's hard to pick a favourite but you must try prawns in ouzo. It was all so good we decided to again but this time we asked the day before if Theo could get us some meat, we decided on pork chops., got to say the best pork chop I have ever tasted along with all the rest, including home made chips. If in Afandou try and find this place and don't judge it on first impression as previously mentioned it is still a family home but what food.",Date of visit: September 2015,Ouzeri o Thioris,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
The Best Accommodation in Afandou if not Rhodes,"Very reluctant to write this review as want to ensure we can get a place in the future but feel I must as Kevin and Sally, the owners, deserve all they can get. Our third visit here and as good as always. We took 2 friends who had never been to Greece before and now they are spoilt. Read all the other reviews none of them are lying everything is taken care of. The whole apartments have every box ticked as other people have mentioned from the simplest things in all the rooms to information and help always on hand. The BBQ given by the host's has got to be the highlight. If you go to Rhodes/Afandou look no further.",Date of stay: August 2015,Afandou Village Apartments,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Nice quiet beach,Good beach although more pebbles than sand the water is crystal clear and it is always quieter than others near by so plenty of room.,Date of experience: August 2015,Afandou Beach,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great day out,Went here as a party of 6 adults not knowing what to expect but so glad we went.Not at all like the normal tourist rubbish. All of us had such a good time. Do not want to say too much about it as it will spoil it for anyone who decides to go. All i will say is go with an open mind and you will love. It involves quite a bit of walking/climbing but nothing too strenuous. I would suggest good water shoes/sandals. As previously mentioned the food is hard to beat and you will not believe he can produce such lovely food when you see the kitchen!!!!! All food and drinks are included in the price. Nickos (not sure of the spelling) is such a lovely genuine man. There were a few children on our trip and they loved it too.,Date of experience: September 2015,Jungle of Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great day out on the water,"Our 3rd trip on the Monachus. It was recommended by English people who live on Rhodes so we took their word for it. As mentioned transfer, if possible is arranged to Kolimbia where you pick up the boat. Then it's up and down the coast with loads of stops for swimming etc. Lunch is provided which was very nice. It is not like the normal tourist boat trips so much more enjoyable. Well worth going on.",Date of experience: September 2015,Monachus Sea Cruises,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Excellent restaurant,"Went as a party of 6, our third visit and the best. The last time we went May last year was ok, but they seem to be back to how it used to be. Lovely food and drinks for all of us. The staff could not be faulted and when the bill arrived we were amazed at how cheap it all was. Highly recommended.",Date of visit: August 2015,Four Seasons,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Can't be beaten,"Went last night a party of 6 adults and had to write a review so soon as we all were so impressed. We started with drinks, beers,spirits and excellent cocktails, which were home made Mojitos. We then ordered food , the Skyline does not call itself a restaurant and it's not, but the small menu was ample for us, when the food arrived we could not have been more impressed. I had burgers , home made and absolutely gorgeous. All the staff were really helpful and so friendly. The bill was very reasonable. We even got free shots. This place is a must if in Afandou as the view alone is fantastic but food and drink hard to beat.",Date of visit: August 2015,Sky-Line Cafe Bar Restaurant,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Not impressed,"Went here as its advertised as oldest in the village and looked ok but we were very disappointed. The setting is nice on the roof terrace but the food just was not as good as other restaurants in the area. Also smaller portions and larger prices than elsewhere.
Up to you to try it out as we may have ordered wrong but I had lamb kleftico which is a greek standard but we were disappointed as all 4 different meals were the same",Date of visit: July 2016,Pithari,1,"Crete, Greece"
Excellent,"Went here on a Monday night to watch the Greek night as it was recommended by a bar owner in Piskopiano. We went a few days before to book as we required a number of tables. Necessary to book as there was not a spare seat anywhere.
The food was excellent as was the service. The show in the square is also good.
Only complaint, the bill was quite large but this was mostly because of drinks. They do not do a house wine and the rest started at 15 euros a bottle also other drinks more expensive. I suppose you are paying for the entertainment.
Would definitely go again but maybe on another night as we have now seen the show.",Date of visit: August 2016,Sofas Taverna,1,"Crete, Greece"
Only a bar not a restaurant,"Called in for pre dinner drinks and it was really nice. The 2 x females in our group had white sangria cocktails which they said were divine. Also the barman / manager was really chatty.
Although we only had drinks we all the free shot as we were leaving.Nice touch.",Date of visit: August 2016,The Trap,1,"Crete, Greece"
Nice bar,"Only had 1 drink as the waitress seemed to take ages, she did apologise as I think the barman was making cocktails for other customers, but it is in a nice setting and would go again if in the area.",Date of visit: August 2016,Cafe Greco,1,"Crete, Greece"
Only average,"Although the food was ok the whole experience justed seemed to lack something.
The restaurant is across 3 different areas (hard to explain) so it does lack atmosphere.
As I said the food was only ok and as a party of 6 adults we all agreed that something was missing.",Date of visit: August 2016,Thira & Eilotas,1,"Crete, Greece"
Drinks only,"Called in twice for drinks, the first time sat in the front and it was lovely very relaxing and nice service.
The second time we arranged to meet our family friends in the garden and at first it was okay but there were children in our party who were playing (oldest only 7yrs) and someone from the bar asked us to keep the noise down as we were near residential properties. Come on!!!!!!!!!! Children on holiday having fun in a bar. We left soon after and they lost a lot of custom.",Date of visit: August 2016,Atrium,1,"Crete, Greece"
Nice bar,"Good bar reasonably priced and nice and clean. The barmen noticed we were watching something on a TV on the far side of the bar so changed the one nearer to us without asking, nice touch.",Date of experience: August 2016,Antidote,1,"Crete, Greece"
Only average,"Called in after being recommended and although there is a good atmosphere it was let down by the drinks. We all thought the drinks were sub standard (I personally had Metaxa and could not taste it).
Give it a try you will either love it or hate it.
It does have sport on TV if you are interested.",Date of experience: August 2016,Nostos Irish Cafe bar,1,"Crete, Greece"
Great day out,"We hired the boat as a group of 28 adults and children and is was great. Picked up at our hotel in taxi and minibus (not the best of vehicles but we were on holiday so - go for it.
The boat was old but all okay. Raki and fruit supplied if you need it, we took our own food and drink.
Captain and mate were good company.
Took us to a beach for swimming and snorkelling etc and the to Sissi.
All in all it was a good relaxing day.",Date of experience: August 2016,Zorbas Cruises,1,"Crete, Greece"
Great day out,"Went on an organised trip that included Spinalonga and we all enjoyed it. There is lots of history and our guide was very informative and helpful. The trip also include a stop off at Agios Nik which was nice.
Not sure of the company who organised it as I did not get involved but I am sure there will be lots doing it.
Recommended",Date of stay: August 2016,Spinalonga Village,1,"Crete, Greece"
Good hotel and location,"Stayed here in February as a party of 8 adults. Can honestly say for what we paid I could not find any faults. The room was spotless, shower, bed etc all fine. There was no wardrobe as such but as we were only there for a few days we managed easily. I notice that a few people have previously complained about the breakfast but what do they expect for the money the hotel charges.
The location was perfect for us,10 mins to station and short walk to all attractions.
