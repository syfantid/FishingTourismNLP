Sailing send off,We had a 14 day sailing trip planned out of Alimos Marina. This was a fantastic place to stay before and after. It was nice to be pampered after 14 days on a boat. Great staff ready to meet every need,Date of stay: September 2019,Coral Hotel Athens,4,"Paleo Faliro, Greece"
"Fish, swim, eat, drink, laugh.","What an amazing day. Watch 3 km of fishing net, set the night before, brought in. From olive oil from Antonia’s olive grove, to fresh tomatoes, to fresh caught and cooked fish, this is an experience not to be missed.",Date of experience: September 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Always something special on the menu.,"We ate here several times during our 2 week stay and quickly learned that we could order fewer meals than we had diners in our group. We almost always had the nightly special, explained each evening in passionate detail by Lorraine. The shrimp saganaki is superb. The sea bream perfectly cooked. Grilled lamb chops practically fall off the bone. Seafood pasta perfectly seasoned. And when we decided to go for more traditional fare, we weren’t disappointed either. All accompanied by wonderful organic village wine.",Date of visit: September 2018,Lorraine's Magic Hill,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
