The original Greek fishing experience,"It was a totally unique experience!! We saw a greek traditional way of fishing, we swam in the crystal waters of Kefalonia and we ate a delicious lunch that was consisted by fish we caught, about an hour before. Captain Michalis cooked the best spaghetti I had in my whole life, with the ""secret ingredient"" the fresh fish, of course. Also, he fried so many tasty fish, as you can see in the pictures. Furthermore, I'm incapable of finding the right words to describe his wife, Antonia, a very communicative person with excellent knowledge of English language, who taught us a lot about Kefalonia and fishing in general and made us laugh a lot too. Last but not least, their daughter Nicky who will keep the best possible company to the children of the family and she's adorable!! It's a completely amazing experience and the day we joined them was the best day at Kefalonia!",Date of experience: September 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
