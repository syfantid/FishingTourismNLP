Fabulous food and good service,Having found this little gem by accident we went back for dinner last night. Steaks cooked perfectly and friendly service. Large garden with amazing estuary views if the weather permits. Thoroughly recommend it,Date of visit: July 2020,The Westleigh Inn,1,"Westleigh, United Kingdom"
Gorgeous little restaurant. Great food and service,Great local restaurant if you want something a little bit more up market than the pub (although that's great too). Excellent food and service. Recommend the fish pie and treacle tart was to die for!,Date of visit: July 2020,Redwing Bar & Dining,1,"Lympstone, United Kingdom"
Fab pub central to village. Brilliant curry,"Fabulous pub always popular with locals, cyclists and visitors. We visited quite a few times, good food and the best kept secret is their Tuesday curry night. We saw it advertised on their website and found we were the only ones eating it as not on main menu. Definitely worth asking for it.....it was absolutely delicious.",Date of visit: July 2020,The Swan Inn,1,"Lympstone, United Kingdom"
"Appalling place, even basics don't work","We stayed thankfully for just 1 night after a local wedding. A very dated place in serious need of refurbishment. Shower didn't work, sink blocked and when we reported it, there wasn't even an apology. Breakfast was stone cold, eggs harder than rocks, and very limited choice. Would never go back or recommend this place. If we hadn't prepaid i wouldn't even have paid the bill without basics such as hot water. If I could score a minus this place would get it",Date of stay: February 2020,The Chichester Hotel,1,"Wickford, United Kingdom"
Excellent Sunday lunch,"Absolutely amazing Sunday lunch with jazz band accompanying as background music. The food was divine, melt in your mouth rib of beef, and the hugest yorkies I've seen. Great staff and the best Sunday lunch in ages. Thoroughly recommend it.",Date of visit: November 2019,Channels Bar & Brasserie,1,"Chelmsford, United Kingdom"
Would not come back again unless you like crowds and ferel children,"Currently staying here but will never come back or recommend this place. You need to be up at 7am to get a sun lounger by the pool, and whilst staff are good and mostly very polite and helpful there are many Russians and eastern Europeans for whom queuing is alien. This is very much a family hotel swarming with children (before UK Holiday times) many without parental supervision so the lack of a lifeguard is a bit unusual. No towels available for 4 days as the hotel is busy! Beach is very disappointing, beach bar is dirty, with broken furniture unlike pool bar which is scrupulously clean. Overall 3 star max not 4 or 5.",Date of stay: July 2019,Roda Beach Resort & Spa,1,"Corfu, Greece"
Excellent food and service,"We had the lamb chops and pork chop. Both were excellent. Great food, beautiful views by the beach. And a lovely drop of rose to help wash it all down",Date of visit: July 2019,Roxannes,1,"Corfu, Greece"
"Excellent day out, authentic and friendly","My husband and I always said we'd never go back to the same place twice, but we're going to break our own rule and go back again, to experience this trip again. A fabulous day with excellent hosts, fishing, swimming, eating the catch, washed down with local wine - my idea of heaven. The group's are small enough to be friendly and are really authentic unlike many of the other touristy boat trips. Definitely a 10/10.",Date of experience: July 2018,Zante Fishing Tours,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Poor service completely over run,Appalling service. 1 girl serving the whole place and not enough bar staff. Manager very happy to walk about but most people sat nursing empty glasses for hours. Would not recommend apart from location to sit watching the world go by,Date of experience: July 2018,Magik The Club,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Great food and location. Definitely recommend it,Fantastic food and perfect beachside location. Service was efficient and attentive without being rushed. Definitely need to book as very popular. Would absolutely recommend it.,Date of visit: November 2017,Fish Beach Taverna,1,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
"A disappointing hotel for service, food quality and room cleanliness.","We came for a family event and whilst a lovely hotel for amenities and very family friendly we did not experience a 5star service. Food often cold and beach bar service in particular very poor even though it was often empty. We had to complain to ask for our room to be cleaned as the cobwebs had been there for ages, as had spillages on the floor. Not the quality we would expect for the rating and price.",Date of stay: November 2017,Sofitel Dubai The Palm,1,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
Overpriced and out of date,The hotel was in a superb location for the town and the beach. However it is in serious need of both basic upgrades and maintenance as well as modernisation. Very much decorated with carpets and furniture from the 80s needing serious improvements. Building exterior literally falling apart in places. A pleasant good sizes bedroom but certainly not warranting prices in bar or indeed overall.,Date of stay: August 2017,The Elstead Hotel,1,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom"
A fabulous place with super friendly staff but a very disappointing beach,"We came for 2 weeks to celebrate my husbands birthday and found it fabulous. The staff are exceptionally friendly and nothing is too much trouble. the resort wasn't full so eating at any of the gourmet restaurants was no problem and only ever half an hour wait....time for another cocktail! The Kampai Asian and Italian restaurants were our favourites. The main criticism was the beach which has razor sharp rocks and unsightly sandbags which are carefully out of sight in all the brochure pictures. Swimming in what should be a beautiful sea wasn't really an option, a careful paddle was about all we could manage. The sun loungers on the beach were perished and very poor quality- not of a standard I expect in a 5 star resort. Despite the disappointment of the beach i would recommend this resort and would definitely return.",Date of stay: February 2017,El Dorado Royale by Karisma,1,"Playa Paraiso, Mexico"
