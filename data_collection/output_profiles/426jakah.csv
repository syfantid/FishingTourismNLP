Beautiful,"By far the best and most authentic trip I've ever been on. It's a must for anyone who likes sea food, you will not go hungry (even if you don't catch much that day). An overall excellent experience, can't recommend it enough! Breathtaking view and beaches, swim to your heart's content and take a diving mask and flippers with you. May even get to see some turtles!",Date of experience: July 2020,Poseidon Fishing Tourism Kefalonia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
