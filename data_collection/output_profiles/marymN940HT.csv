Great experience,"We had a great time, I laughed and screamed in equal measures! The weirdest thing was looking at your hands when you had the VR headset on.The actors were brilliant too. And last but not least we had the tickets which included food and 2 drinks each, really good value, and the food was lush, some of the best fries I've ever had! Perfect experience!!",Date of experience: October 2019,Jeff Wayne's The War of The Worlds: The Immersive Experience,4,"London, United Kingdom"
"best day out, best value!!!","This was our 3rd trip on this traditional fishing boat, it is so perfect, if you want to swim you can!! The Captain and the ""family"" make you feel so welcome and relaxed, and everybody makes that ""WOW"" sound when the food is served up, as its fresh fish caught that day with delicious fish soup and a beautiful potato salad, lobster spaghetti and more, i always think i have died and gone to heaven.....Thank you so much for the perfect day, Michalis, Antonia, Hassan and Nicky!!! Bad news is this... we will be back!! xxxx",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Best value!!!,"We chanced upon this little gem, as a day visitor, we both had plaice and chips, and it was freshly cooked for us, piping hot and delicious, My son joined us halfway through, which was lucky as I couldnt eat all of mine as it was enormous...very friendly and helpful staff too, thanks guys",Date of visit: August 2018,Ossie's Best Fish and Chips,4,"Whitstable, United Kingdom"
Relaxing peaceful location,"We had the most fantastic 2 weeks staying at Manolia, Ilias and Eleni made us so welcome, no notices saying ""do this or don't do that"" apart from the obligatory ones at pool, which also was cleaned every day. Very peaceful location, the rooms have had a recent update, with free air con to boot!! Nothing was too much trouble, and trust me,we were a pain,at times... locking ourselves out, falling over etc etc.
We will (sorry Ilias) be back, for the hospitality and the fantastic views, also the lovely lady who came to ""do"" the rooms!!! oh, and lovely mattresses!!",Date of stay: June 2018,Manolia Studios,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Warm welcome!,"we spent 3 nights here, very comfy and clean, but what made the visit was the warm welcome from Suzanne & Trevor, I feel we left as friends, The breakfast was also very tasty, we will definitely be back, sorry guys!! Also loved the restaurant they own as well, so much so, we ate there every night, its called Fawlty Towers!! See you again!!",Date of stay: July 2017,Merrydale,4,"Skegness, United Kingdom"
Best boat trip ever!!!,"This was the day trip that we never wanted to end!! It was such a great day out, we met at the traditional wooden boat at Svoronata at eightish, were welcomed on board with cake and coffee and teas, then we set off on the crystal clear sea, round the coast, was fun spotting places that you recognised, some fishing nets were hauled aboard, and it was fascinating watching the different species of fish that had been collected, some I had never seen, ie a ""glass fish"" just looked like, a ball of glass!! (not a jelly fish!!) then we stopped for optional swimming, and refreshments were offered too!!! then we were able to have a go at fishing with a rod, and there was a little competition between the males on the boat!! (my partner came last lol)!! which caused much merriment!!! then there was was more catch to be got aboard, and we had a go at untangling the fish from the nets, not as easy as it looks!!! we then had a fantastic lunch with the fresh fish we had just caught, with the best potato salad, and spaghetti and salad!! we then made a leisurely trip back to port, it was a full day!! We laughed such a lot, as Antonia and Michalis are such great hosts, and the others we were with, were all in agreement, it was the BEST DAY EVER!!! Thanks guys",Date of experience: September 2016,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
