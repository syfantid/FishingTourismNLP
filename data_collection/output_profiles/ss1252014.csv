Excellent,"Stayed in October with family for an event. Really nice hotel. Very comfortable and clean, rooms are a good standard and thoroughly cleaned daily. Service is generally excellent. Food varied and good quality. Highly recommended. We will return.",Date of stay: October 2019,Golden Bahia De Tossa & Spa,1,"Tossa de Mar, Spain"
Excellent,"Clean, fresh, modern room. Perfect for our 1 night stay. Reasonably priced with a decent continental breakfast buffet. My
12 year old son loved the giant jenga in the lounge, staff were helpful and allowed us to check in to our room on arrival at 11am. I would stay again without hesitation and recommend.",Date of stay: August 2019,MOXY London Heathrow Airport,1,"Hounslow, United Kingdom"
Very disappointing,"Bought two Yorkshire pudding meals, service was poor - staff seemed disinterested, no care about presentation, food just thrown in the box which was handed to us covered in food and grease. The seating area didnt look like it had been cleaned all day and wasn't a hygienic or pleasant place to sit and eat. Beef just fat and grissle and practically inedible, turkey was just bits of skin and slimy fatty stringy bits. Not at all appetising!",Date of visit: August 2019,The York Roast Co.,1,"York, United Kingdom"
Great experience,"I'd highly recommend this to adults and families with older children. A rare chance to learn about traditional fishing, see the turtles, swim / snorkel on remote parts of the island on a quiet traditional fishing boat (just 7 of us on this trip) with very friendly hosts who genuinely want their customers to have an amazing experience. Thank you, some fantastic memories!",Date of experience: August 2019,Poseidon Fishing Tourism Kefalonia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Disgraceful,"This is by far the most disgusting hotel I have ever stayed. Had 2 nights here and would have not stayed had I not had plans in the area. The room and restaurant was appallingly filthy. Struggled to find a clean cup and plate in the restaurant and the food was disgusting. Mould growing up the tiles in the shower cubicle that was so small you couldn't help but touch the walls!! Tena lady wrappers by the side of my bed (not mine). Â£180 for 2 nights in a supposed decent room with sea views is not ""cheap"" and i have stayed for half tgis price in hotels which are basic bur at least clean. I am surprised this place is still open and allowed to operate in the state is. Such a shame as the building structure and views are amazing.",Date of stay: September 2018,Grand Hotel Scarborough,1,"Scarborough, United Kingdom"
Basic accommodation in a stunning location spoilt by poor service,"Beautiful location. Very basic accommodation which serves as a simple base. Generally clean, although rooms cleaned/towels changed only once during our week long stay (not twice as advertised). Staff unhelpful and unfriendly. We were refused more toilet roll on running out and told ""self catering"". I have never experienced this before! I also received a very curt response when I politely asked when our room would be cleaned.

Food and drink on site is expensive and the owners were very strict about only eating / drinking anything by the pool that was bought on site (including water). I totally understand they need to make money but even water was very over priced.

The location is stunning and the accommodation is basic but perfectly adequate as a base, however it is totally spoilt by poor service and rude owners, not the sort of environment you want to be in on holiday and there are other hotels in the area which are friendly and more deserving of the business.",Date of stay: June 2017,Aristomenis Studios,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
