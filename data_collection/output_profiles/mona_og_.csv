Fantastic experience!,"Anthi, Mohammed, & Marco (Amr) were without a doubt amazing! Very knowledgeable staff & simply just great people! We both tried fishing for the first time & it was actually really fun! I caught my first little fish too! Keep in mind if you do get motion sickness easily which I do, to get some of that medicine (as I got from a local pharmacy there) to help as I felt every wave in the sea lol We did the morning one, and it was so fun too see how they retrieve the catch from the previous day & just see the island from a different perspective & view! Also, it was very relaxing to just be out at sea with a smaller tour. Definitely recommend!",Date of experience: October 2019,Giorgaros fishing tours Santorini,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Simply Amazing!,"Emi & family where nothing short of outstanding! Very accommodating & personable! Great place to stay quiet away from all the commotion, but convenient because they knew all the tours that are available in Santorini & will reach out to them directly & set them up for you which helped us out a great deal. We explained to Emi what days we wanted to do what & she called every single place & set them up.

Keep in mind if you want to do any exploring of the entire island on your own it is extremely convenient to have some sort of personal transportation. They do have local transportation, however the bus stop is maybe a 15 min walk down an inclining hill, which walking down is fine, but climbing that bad boy at night was quite the workout! lol! We ended up renting an ATV from them which was so much fun & allowed us to drive around & explore the island at our own time & not having to worry about the means of transportation. Also, when coming from the airport if you just reach out to Emi we found it most convenient using their airport transfer!

The food was delicious! The morning breakfast buffets had all the essential breakfast items... Emiâ€™s sister was so kind enough to remember that we do not eat particular food items & simply just customized some breakfast items for us & that was nothing we had asked her she simply just did out of the kindness of her own heart, which was really appreciative!

If we ever come back to Santorini, we definitely will come back to visit here! At the end of the our trip we had 2 different/separate flights & my flight ended up leaving the next day... there rooms were completely booked, however they reached out to the hotel across the way to see if they had a rooms available just to sleep and store my things in which was so thoughtful & helpful! They definitely made us feel at ease & like family very inviting & welcoming!",Date of stay: October 2019,Villa Galinia,5,"Santorini, Greece"
