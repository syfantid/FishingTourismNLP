Fabulous day out!,"We booked this trip with Antonia before we flew out to Kefalonia. She was very quick at replying and very informative about the day. It starts at 8am from Agia Pelagia in Svoronata with coffee, juice and cake freshly baked by Antonia.
The sea had been a bit rough for a day or two, so our original trip date was postponed, but Antonia does a great job of rescheduling the trips so we were able to go the next day. Safety an enjoyment of guests is paramount to Antonia and Michalis.
We watched nets for the next evening being cast and then the catch for the day was brought in, mainly the nets are for lobster but we also saw hermit crabs, starfish, red mullet and sea bream. Whilst the nets are cleaned you sail to a beautiful clear beach where you can jump from the boat and swim/snorkel. We had an appetiser of bruschetta and 7 day salt cured tuna, then the main event was lobster, spaghetti, Greek salad, potato salad and home made wine. This was our first experience of lobster (myself and 14 year old son) and it was delicious!
This is a working fishing boat trip and several guests were not feeling great when out on the open water. Captain Michalis returned to the port to drop these guests off, then we continued for the day as just a group of 4, me, my son and a lovely Italian couple. It was like a private boat trip! My son said it was the best boat trip he had been on (our 3rd different boat trip in Kefalonia). Thank you Antonia, Michalis and crew for a great day.
