This was a ripper tour!,"Friendly and informative captain, Giorgos. Enjoyable net-fishing experience followed by a sumptuous buffet on board (which included our catch of red mullet - delicious!).

Also included swimming stops and a beach stop. A top-value experience not to be missed!

Would definitely recommend - Tom and Trish",Date of experience: September 2018,Zante Fishing Tours,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
