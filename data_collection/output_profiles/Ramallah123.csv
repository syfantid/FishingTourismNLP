Beautiful Traditional Riad,"The fourth time I've stayed at this beautiful traditional family run riad. I really would not stay any where else. Beautiful spacious rooms, beautifully renovated. Nothing is too much trouble. Sumptuous breakfast included in the price of the room. The food is traditional Moroccan, beautifully cooked. Nothing is any trouble. Zak and Maria speak perfect English and French and can arrange anything you ask for. I can't wait to visit again next year.",Date of visit: December 2019,Riad Rcif,5,"Fes, Morocco"
Best day of my holiday. Fishing and eating with great hosts,"Such a wonderful day spent with Efi, Dimitrios and Mohammed on their fishing cruise. The experience is one I shall never forget. Swimming in the small secluded bays. Great company. The fish we caught in the nets were the best fish I have ever eaten all cooked by Efi. Served with lemon potatoes and salad and washed down with red wine, beer or soft drinks. Our hosts were exceptional. I cannot wait until next year so I can do it all again. Thank you for the best day of my holiday. A*** all the way",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
