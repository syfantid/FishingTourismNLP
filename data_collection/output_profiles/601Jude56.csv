Michelis Fishing trip,"Fabulous day fishing with Antonia and her lovely family. Antonia has a beautiful kind and caring personality. We had homemade cake,and Greek seafood cooked straight from the sea. Best Fisherman's spaghetti I have ever tasted. Would highly recommend. Lots of laughter. A day we will never forget.

Excellent,"The best Indian in Cupar by far!.Staff are all very helpful and give you lots of information about the food.My husband had the tandoori mixed grill which was to die for! And i had the lamb palak,the meat was so tender.the naan breads are all freshly made and i recommend having the peshwari naan.If you are in Cupar this is a must to have food.",Date of visit: December 2014,Aangan Restaurant,4,"Cupar, United Kingdom"
