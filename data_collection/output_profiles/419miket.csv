Road Biking in Rhodes,"We hired 2 carbon road bikes from Zois. Great service, good quality bikes delivered to our Hotel down in the South East of the Island. Some great rides, as soon as you are off the N95 you rarely see a car, roads good, scenery stunning and climbs challenging but quite doable. Highly recommended.",Date of experience: October 2020,Rodos Cycling,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Perfect End To A Fantastic Day,"We stopped off here for a late lunch after a bike ride into the mountains around Monolithos. What a fantastic decision. Authentic family taverna, wonderful friendly lady owner. Lots of local specialities, freshly cooked. Cold beer with iced glasses. Generous portions. Wonderful, tranquil setting. We felt blessed to have stumbled upon Pelecanos. YOU MUST TRY IT",Date of visit: October 2020,Pelecanos Taverna,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Super Week in Unspoilt Part of the Algarve,"Just spent a fantastic week with my daughter in this super apartment. Immaculately clean, modern and with everything you need. Lovely garden space. Pool across the road with fantastic views. Short walk into Fuseta, we loved it, very uncommercial. Good choice of restaurants, cafes etc. October was a great time to visit if you like the quiet, we had Isle de Fuseta to ourselves virtually. Thanks Christiaan for a wonderful break.",Date of stay: October 2019,Fuseta Ria Resort Traffic Free -Luxury apartment,4,"Fuseta, Portugal"
Fantastic Authentic Experience - Truly Special Family Memories,"We had a fantastic day, treated to a unique experience. As others have said, there are plenty of boat trips on Kefalonia and elsewhere. This offers something different. Dimitrios and Efi make you feel welcome, with smiles on their faces, from the first moment you step onto their lovely boat.

Helping them bring in the catch is something very few people will get to experience, and gives you a great insight into the life of the new fishermen of the Mediterranean. A special mention too for Muhammad, hard working, the patience of a saint and all with a smile on his face. You can get involved as much or as lit as you want.

Then plenty of time for swimming, snorkelling, sun bathing, chattering with newly made friends, and simply relaxing. Even a clay bath if you fancy it, go on - it promises to make you twenty years younger

Meanwhile Efi is cooking the most delicious lunch including a wonderful selection of fish fresh from our catch.

Family holidays are all about memories. Thanks again to Dimitrios, Efi and Muhammad for giving us a day to remember.

Superb Family Break,"Excellent family break. The standard of service we received in the Royal Level made it a very special week's holiday as a family. Staying All Inclusive in the Royal Level not only gave access to the more exclusive Ancla restaurant at breakfast and dinner, bit also gave virtually unrestricted AI access to the various other bars and restaurants throughout the Barcelo resort. Highlight was the El Faro pier bar at sundown, and the Noray snack bar was great, overlooking the marina, for lunch or for a relaxed drink.

If you want a special experience for a break in Fuerteventura, this is the place to go to",Date of stay: April 2019,Barcelo Castillo Royal Level,4,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Fantastic Family Holiday at this Wonderful Villa,"We spent 2 fabulous weeks at Villa Rafaela in July 2018. The villa is wonderful and the outside space is fantastic. Everything is there for a luxury stay. The inside of the villa has plenty of space and is fitted out to a very high quality, with everything you need. The pool, furniture, barbecue, gardens are all very high quality and the views of the mountains, surrounding villages and the sea are spectacular. Kamilari is a lovely, traditional Cretan village, unspoiled but with a good choice of tavernas and a lovely small supermarket and bakery. Giorgos, Maria and Helen, the family that own the villa, made us feel very welcome and did everything to make our holiday very special. We would love to return, maybe in 2019.

Lovely Pizza & Pasta,"We visited this restaurant on the edge of Kamilari during our recent holiday for a meal, and also had pizza takeaway for the family from them on another night. Service is great and the food is very good quality, with generous portions. Views from the terrace seating area are also very good.",Date of visit: August 2018,La Cucina di Maria Pizzeria,4,"Crete, Greece"
Lovely Location on the edge of Kamilari,"Very nice taverna on the edge of Kamilari. We visited twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Food was high quality, a little more modern than the more traditional tavernas in the area. Service was friendly and efficient.",Date of visit: July 2018,Restaurant Chrisopigi,4,"Crete, Greece"
One Of Our Favourites in Kamilari,"We visited on several occasions over our 2 week holiday, including our first lunch on arrival and our dinner on our last night. The terrace area is lovely, with a nice breeze in the summer and wonderful views. Food is simple but very tasty. You must take up their offer to visit the kitchen to see what the daily specials are; the ladies doing the cooking will appreciate it and you will be in for a treat if you pick one of their tasty, home cooked specials. You can mix and match some of their vegetable sides which I strongly recommend. Service is friendly and pretty efficient. Raki and fruit at the end to finish a lovely evening.",Date of visit: July 2018,Taverna Acropolis,4,"Crete, Greece"
Our Favourite Taverna In Kamilari,"We visited for dinner on several occasions over our 2 weeks. The friendliest service, even when they are busy. Traditional food well cooked, please take the time to have a look in the kitchen at their daily specials; you will find some treats. A good choice of dishes for all the family. Very good value for money and you wont go home hungry. Complementary fruit and raki at the end of our meal. The owners produce their own olive oil and raki, very good and you can take a bottle home.

If you are staying in the village, or nearby, we really recommend the little village food store Mylonas in the village. It is owned and run by the same family, the service is really friendly and helpful. Doing our shopping there was a pleasure and added to the positive experience of our holiday.",Date of visit: August 2018,Taverna Mylonas,4,"Crete, Greece"
Lovely lunches and Spectacular Views,"Visited twice for lunch. Views are truly spectacular from their large terrace overlooking Kommos Bay. Service was friendly and food very tasty. Fresh fish was very good, especially the sea bass. You pay a little more than at some tavernas in the area but for the location and views, its definitely worth it.",Date of visit: August 2018,Vrachos Taverna,4,"Crete, Greece"
"Fantastic Lunches In Beautiful, Traditional Surroundings","We had 2 wonderful lunches at this lovely taverna. Tucked away behind the church, with a stunning small courtyard garden to sit and eat in. Husband and wife team, everything cooked and prepared fresh. Tasty food with some nice touches. Fantastic way to spend a chilled lunchtime.",Date of visit: August 2018,Alekos Taverna,4,"Crete, Greece"
Excellent Service and Great Value,"We booked with Luka for transfers both way from Dubrovnik Airport to Montenegro (Becici, near Budvar).

Email communication with Luka was very clear, quick replies and Luka was very helpful.

Drivers both ways were there on time, vehicles were great and both journeys went very smoothly. If you are crossing the border, you have to be prepared to be a bit patient. Our crossing on arrival was a bit slow but our driver knew all the tricks to make it as quick as possible ;-) Return was very smooth. If you are heading towards Budvar you do get the added benefit of a ferry crossing in a spectacular setting across Kotor Bay.

All-in-all we were very happy and it was very good value for money. We would definitely use next time.",Date of experience: June 2018,Transfers-Montenegro,4,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
Fabulous Week at the Iberostar Bellevue,"We’ve just had a great week here, traveling as a family with teenage kids. Hotel and grounds attractive and very well kept. Staff very friendly and helpful, helped make the holiday special. Scenery and surrounding area spectacular, especially if you get out and explore a bit. We walked along the seafront to Sveti Stefan twice - a walk not to be missed. Food was great, the outdoor seating at the Terrace restaurant with views across the bay made meals extra special. Pool a bit noisy during animation team time, but only for short periods. You can find sun beds elsewhere in the gardens and there are plenty of sun beds on the beach. You do pay a few € each per day for the beach ones but a small price to pay for peace, spectacular views and a gentle breeze on hot days. The beach bar is all inclusive too, a bonus.

We also booked a wonderful day tour with Montenegro M Tours. Contact Mladen via Tripadvisor or his website for a truly unforgettable day. If you visit Montenegro it would be a crime not to see some of the stunning scenery.",Date of stay: June 2018,Iberostar Bellevue,4,"Becici, Montenegro"
Fantastic Day With Mladen,"We spent a fantastic day with our guide, Mladen experiencing just some of the spectacular and varied scenery of Montenegro. Our tour included the mountains of Lovcen National Park and the unforgettable, stunning sights around Rijeka Crnojevića on the edge of Skadar Lake.

Mladen was wonderful company. Enthusiastic, incredibly knowledgeable and clearly very passionate about this beautiful country. We loved his sense of humour and the whole experience has been the highlight of our stay in Montenegro.

We would love to return and if we do we would certainly book another tour with Mladen, this time to explore the National Parks in the North of the Country.

If you visit the beach resorts of Montenegro, be sure to explore a little of this stunning country. And be sure to do so with Mladen and Montenegro M Tours.",Date of experience: June 2018,Montenegro M Tours,4,"Kotor, Montenegro"
Fantastic family holiday; wonderful villa accomodation,"We had a fantastic two week family holiday staying at the Villa Artemi. The location of the villas is great; close to all the amenities and the beach in Plakias, yet set back in a quiet side road. Villa very well equipped for a family, spotlessly clean and nicely furnished. Pool, patio and gardens were lovely to relax in; patio has sun on it all day, but there are areas of shade if you need a break from the sun. Plakias has a great selection of tavernas, some nice waterfront bars and a good choice of shops. The scenery around Plakias is stunning, so much to explore. Special mention to the owner Filippos and his son Frederick, they made the holiday extra special. On hand to make sure the pool and gardens were spotless, ensure all was great in the villa and offer advice and recommendations to make sure we enjoyed our holiday to the maximum. We look forward to returning, hopefully next year.",Date of stay: July 2017,VILLA ALKISTI &VILLA ARTEMI,4,"Crete, Greece"
Fantastic Family Holiday,"Just back from a fantastic 2 week family holiday at Oceania. This was our second visit, and surpassed our already high expectations. From the warm welcome you receive on arrival, you know you are truly on holiday. I can honestly say we have never relaxed as quickly on a holiday before.

In every aspect, the hotel is excellent, and represents tremendous value for money for a luxurious family holiday. The rooms are immaculately clean, modern and spacious with fantastic sea views, the food of great quality, fresh, varied and plentiful. There are options to dine in the 3 a la carte restaurants as well as the main restaurant, and the al fresco breakfast in the taverna with fresh poached eggs (with Dafy's speciality paprika and oregano garnish) was very welcome.

As so many others have mentioned, it is the staff more than anything else that makes a stay at Oceania so special. Whether it's the maids, restaurant, spa, bar, reception staff, or wherever, you will find them incredibly friendly, helpful and pleased to make your stay truly memorable.

Special mention to Irina and her team in the Olympus Bar (Theodora, Stephan and the chef Vangelis). If you are lucky enough to stay in Block 5, from first thing in the morning until last thing at night they will ensure you are pampered in every way, drinks delivered to your sunbeds, ice cold towels to mop your brow, light snacks at the poolside bar, and always with an engaging smile and kind words. Drinks early evening as the sun sets, with fantastic views over the sea to Mount Olympus is something I really miss now we are back in the UK. Another special mention to Dafy and George and their team at the taverna restaurant, they do everything to ensure that your a la carte evening meal there is very special and memorable.

Finally thanks, and bravo to the hotel manager, Timos. Despite it being peak season, he still finds time to seek out new arrivals to say hello. You will see him walking the hotel every day ensuring everything remains up to his very high standards, and he is always keen to stop for a quick chat and to ensure that everything is being done to make your stay enjoyable.

We certainly look forward to returning next year. We have holidayed throughout Europe and would be surprised if you can find better value-for-money for a luxurious, family-friendly holiday.",Date of stay: July 2013,Ikos Oceania,4,"Nea Moudania, Greece"
