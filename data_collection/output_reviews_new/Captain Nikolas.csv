1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bklazura,August 2019,5,Great Experience!,Artemis and Nikolas take you out and you get to pick the fish filled nets up. They then park the boat and let you clean the nets of fish and relax and swim at one of the many beaches around Mykonos.
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amrisab,July 2019,5,Our Favorite Day in Mykonos,"Our morning/afternoon out with Captain Nikolas and Artemis is the best memory of our Mykonos trip this summer. They were gracious, generous, and so very kind from the moment we stepped on to their boat. It was truly a local and traditional experience. It was such a pleasure to be aboard with these amazing gentlemen. Artemis is full of stories and knowledge of the island. Nikolas is a lovely host, offering us coffee first thing in the morning, and a cooler full of beers, sodas, and waters throughout the day. Artemis showed us how to pull the net in, and so we did! We had plenty of fish which Artemis then cleaned, and Nikolas fried up! We had a super fresh lunch of fish, Greek salad, and rusk. We were stuffed and everything was delicious. Nikolas even rolled me a couple of his cigarettes.While they cleaned and cooked, we were anchored and allowed to swim, but decided to stay aboard as that was pleasant enough. I can’t stress enough how comfortable we felt with these two lovely individuals. I would highly recommend for a fun, insightful experience you won’t ever forget. I know we’ll always cherish the day we spent with Nikolas and Artemis. It was an honor to experience their day-to-day lives."

They were gracious, fun, accommodating and super friendly.  They gave us a lot of background on Mykonos and took us out for a great day of fishing, swimming and eating.  It was a treat to spend the day with two of them.  Nikolas cooked up a bunch of the fish with some other local food and made a fantastic meal.  Artemis cleaned a large amount of fish for us to take home as well which we ate the next night."
