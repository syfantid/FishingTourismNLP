"Red Mullet, Parrot Fish, Octopus, Nets, Traps, Swimming, Sunset ... and a GREAT Captain and Crew","Words cannot describe how awesome this excursion with Anthi, Marcos, and Muhammad was.

Anthi was also our Captain. She was born into a real commercial fishing family of Santorini that also owns a restaurant. She's been fishing these waters since she was 4 years old, worked in the restaurant, has a degree in philosophy, dancing, is a teacher, and can drive that big boat with her eyes closed.

If I had to do my week in Santorini over again, I would have done this fishing trip first ... because I learned sooo much. This had it all: 800 meter nets, fish traps, swimming, a real feast (they cooked what we caught right in front of us), a sunset ... and most important Anthi's expert instruction about everything we saw, tasted, and experienced.

She even gave me her personal ""Shrimp Sanganaki"" recipe (and if you don't know what that is ... you need to try it).

This is not a ""sport fishing"" type of excursion. Don't expect to catch 200lb Tarpon. It's a very family oriented, cultural, educational, ""Anthony Bourdain"" type of experience ... run by incredibly talented people who love and care about the sea. It was exactly what I was looking for.",Date of experience: June 2018,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
