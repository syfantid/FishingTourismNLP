Wow! Best food place in Rhodes!,"Myself and my partner come to Rhodes every year. We decided one night to try Da Romeo's for food. We were so impressed from the moment we stepped inside with the customer service we received , from all staff, but especially Thomas. The food is the best in Rhodes, everything is made freshly. The resturant is immaculate, and the staff go out of the way to make sure your experience here is one to remember.",Date of visit: July 2019,Da Romeo,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Best fishing trip ever!!,"Me and my partner decided to go on a fishing trip in Rhodes, wow what can I say it took our breaths away! The service on board was amazing. We caught loads of fish, and I struggled with fishing and the kind gentleman helped me, and I ended up catching two fish in one go!

The highlight of our trip was the Fresh fish BBQ and Fresh salad and fruit. Best fish I have ever eat! We also went snorkelling which was lovely to cool off. Anyone looking to book a fishing trip You won't be dissapointed with this company !! 10/10! Thank you for making this an amazing memory for us :)

"""Licence holder manager"" ruined our experience","We arrived at las iguanas In Cardiff for a good evening out celebrating, we spent £90 there all together on drinks, we were sat outside and I got cold , my partner who was being a gentleman, asked the "" licence holder manager"" politely if we could kindly sit down in the resturant area considering it was 20 minutes before they stopped serving food , as the bar area there was no where to sit. Bearing in mind I was holding a tray full of drinks. He started getting arrogant towards my partner and said that we were not allowed to sit in the resturant area and that there was nothing he could do to accomadate is! This is bizarre considering how much money we spent in this place. To make matters even worse, because my partner was asking him why he couldn't accomadate us, he started shouting at us saying he didn't want us in his bar and that he would phone the police if we didn't leave. Everybody was looking, to a point where a lovely couple invited us over to sit down with them seeing how uncomfortable his behaviour towards us were. They even commented on how horrible of a man he was being. I will not be returning here and I will definitely be telling people about our bad experience here. Dissapointed to say the least, especially as Iv always worked in customer service, this is not a way to treat loyal customers!",Date of visit: June 2019,Las Iguanas - Cardiff,4,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"
Amazing time,"Movenpick hotel was an amazing hotel, staff were very polite and helpful , rooms were very nice and the beds were comfortable and the room was a warm temperature. Amsterdam centre is about a 7 minute walk which is nothing. Overall this stay was a 10/10.",Date of stay: February 2016,Mövenpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
