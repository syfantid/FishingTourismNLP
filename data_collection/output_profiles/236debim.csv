First Class as usual !!!!!!,"Our 3rd holiday in Kefalonia & 3rd time at The Magnolia. We wouldn't stay anywhere else, why would you, it's perfect. I've said it before, you can't please everyone but when people start getting personal about individuals it really winds me up !!!!
People go back to The Magnolia year after year and why wouldn't you ?
Nota, Effi and the boys are the perfect hosts so I really struggle with the negativity.
The half board menu is somewhat limited - so go self catering, simple. The food has always been great. As for not enough breakfast choice, how much choice do you people want for god sake ??
The fantastic reviews out way the negative,we can't all be wrong ???",Date of stay: August 2018,Magnolia Resort,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic cruise,"Just got back from our fishing cruise. What an amazing day, Demitri & Effi were fantastic hosts who couldn't do enough for you. The freshly caught fish were cooked to perfection, accompanied by a delicious potato salad and homemade wine. We cruised along the beautiful
coastline with a couple of swim breaks in coves only reachable by boat.
It's a trip we will do again and highly recommend.",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great food,"We came across this restaurant by accident and at 10:45 pm wasn't sure if they would let us in. How wrong we were ! The service was great and food was exceptional, lots of locals in there which is always a good sign. Definitely worth a visit",Date of visit: August 2015,Tsobos Garden Grillhouse,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Amazing holiday ðŸ˜Š,"Just returned from an amazing 2 week holiday at the resort. I find it difficult to read the negative reviews which are so unjust. The staff are all fantastic and as for the ' grandma' remarks which are very personal, maybe if you spoke to Chris & Alexis's grandmother you would of found out what a lovely person she is. The food at the Bistro was excellent and there was plenty of choice for breakfast. The pool area was lovely with plenty of sunbeds. We also celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary and had flowers and wine delivered to our room, which was a lovely surprise it's so true you can't please everyone but it seems people are out to find fault whatever. The peace and quiet was exactly what we wanted and we will be back next year. Thank you to you all at the Magnolia.",Date of stay: August 2015,Magnolia Resort,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
