Best trip I’ve ever had!!,Best trip i’ve ever had! We experienced a special day with captain Demetres and his boat. Demetres showed us many hidden beauties of Skiathos that you can only reach by boat. He was very kind and friendly with us and the best guide of the island. He positively surprised us with lots of fresh fruits and aperitifs. At Lalaria beach he served us the freshest sea urchins which he had just fished for us. It was an excellent day! We will definitely come back next summer for this trip with Demetres.,Date of experience: July 2018,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
