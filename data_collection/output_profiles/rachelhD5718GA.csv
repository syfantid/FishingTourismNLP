Best day everrrrrr,"This was hands down our best day of the holiday. Dimitris fed us from the second we stepped aboard the Alexander till the moment we disembarked 8 hours later. We had pastries fresh caught urchins, prawns, sea bream & beautiful fresh fruit platter, the compliment to this was an open bar with water & soft drinks for our teen. We had the most amazing eight hours visiting beautiful beaches inc Lalaria which was breath taking. I would definitely recommend this trip & will definitely be back, thank you Dimitris for making our holiday in Skiathos a memorable one.",Date of experience: August 2020,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Lovely friendly staff,"Really enjoyed our stay here, the hotel was lovely, staff were very friendly. The only drawback was the bed, they had pushed two single beds together which was a bit disappointing. Other than this we had a lovely break.",Date of stay: August 2016,Fistral Beach Hotel and Spa,4,"Newquay, United Kingdom"
