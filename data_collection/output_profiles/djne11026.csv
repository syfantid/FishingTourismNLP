Leisurely Lunch,Visited for a leisurely lunch by the sea and were really glad we did. The setting and service were excellent and the food delicious. We loved the quirky Strawberry soup for desert. Although not cheap the prices were great for this level of experience. Highly recommended.,Date of visit: October 2020,Albergo Gelsomino,1,"Kós, Greece"
We loved it,"Visited for a week at the end of October and hotel was everything we wanted. Lovely friendly helpful staff, great breakfast, well equipped, comfortable room and special pool area. We stayed for one five course evening meal which was delicious but, because there were only two other couples eating, sadly rather lacked atmosphere. Although it’s not in the centre of town it’s a pleasant 15 minute walk in and easily accessible for main sights and harbour. My husband enjoyed using the local gym. Our only issue was the price of the drinks which unreasonably higher than in town. If you’re looking for places to eat at night in walking distance we’d recommend Rustico and Nick the Fisherman . We’d love to come back next year.",Date of stay: October 2020,Diamond Boutique Hotel,1,"Kós, Greece"
Wonderful fresh fish,We liked this restaurant so much we came back twice. The service is easy and friendly and the restaurant has a lot of local people in. The Mussels saganski was especially good.

The guide was right,We always worry when a place is recommended by a guide having been let down badly in the past however on this occasion he was right. We had the stuffed courgette flower starter which was delicious and the goat for main. It was very tasty and different. The restaurant was careful about Covid restrictions. Recommended.,Date of visit: October 2020,Vegos Restaurant,1,"Nisiros, Greece"
Lovely Salad. Great view,"We visited for a late lunch after a boat trip and didn’t regret it. We were wary of it at first worrying it could be an over priced tourist trap. We both had the fish salad , which despite not having the advertised mussels , was delicious and very filling. The pitta bread was so good we had more. The staff were friendly and efficient. If we’d more time here we’d go back.",Date of visit: October 2020,Sifis Restaurant Tavern,1,"Kós, Greece"
Great local meal,The meat in this restaurant was delicious but be warned the portions are very large so you may want to share. On a Wednesday night it was filled with locals and people coming for take outs. Just great. Recommended.,Date of visit: October 2020,O Lampros,1,"Kós, Greece"
Couldn’t be better,We didn’t do the fishing trip but the one hour mini cruise which went ahead despite there only being two of us on board.

Great place to stay,We stayed for a week and really enjoyed the hotel. The room was very comfortable and well equipped ( though as a Brit I would have liked tea making facilities in our room). The breakfast was wonderful and it was great to eat outside with a stunning view of Vesuvius. The pool area is not huge but it was fine for us. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Our only issue was the very high cost of the drinks by the pool and in the rooftop bar. Well over the top.,Date of stay: September 2020,Hotel Regina Sorrento,1,"Sorrento, Italy"

Found this restaurant by accident,Found this restaurant by accident we’re glad we did. The menu is interesting and the food delicious. The risotto was especially good.

Great well organised trips,"We went on two trips with this company, one to Spingarola and one to Cretan villages and Chania. The boat trip to Spingarola was a highlight as was the lunch. Both were well organised and took good care of the clients. Barbara in particular was a great guide very informative and interesting. The drivers were skilled and friendly.

From the friendly welcome at 1am in the morning ( including a salad in our rooms) to the opportunity to use all the facilities while we waited for our 10.15 pm flight the service has been exceptional. The rooms are very clean comfortable and well equipped and the pool and communal areas are interestingly decorated. No where even here is perfect and the food whilst otherwise of a very high quality would benefit from including more Cretan cuisine. The music round the pool is a little monotonous if you’re not a drum and bass fan. Finally huge thanks to all the hard working and friendly staff.,Date of stay: September 2019,The Syntopia Hotel,1,"Crete, Greece"

A real mixture,This hotel is well resourced with a nice swimming pool and exchange office. We visited twice and much preferred the room at the front which was larger and not so dark. The rooms were comfortable and well equipped . The evening meal was a poor introduction to our time in Uzbekistan. The breakfast buffet is fine but they could do with a new toaster. It was a bizarre mixture with dirty tablecloths from the night before and an excellent old world very skilled pianist at breakfast. For independent travellers the biggest issue will be the distance from the centre of the city.,Date of stay: June 2019,Asia Tashkent,1,"Tashkent, Uzbekistan"

Mixed lunch,This was a very mixed experience for us as a group of 13 people of a range of ages. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and went out of their way to help my 95 year old mum in law and the two babies we had with us. The mixed ribs were excellent and much appreciated as was the fish pie. However the tomato soup was very bitter and over herbed and the steak pie was a real disappointment. The meat was tough and the filling salty overall. We did mention this to the staff who were surprised and apologetic.
