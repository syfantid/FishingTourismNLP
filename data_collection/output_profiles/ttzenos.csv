One of the best budget hotels ever!,"My wife and I spent two nights in Marble Hotel in Koukaki, Athens in early October 2019 and had a wonderful experience there. First of all, the hosts made us feel welcome and did everything they could to cate for our needs. Being so friendly, caring and outgoing, they even went out of their way to help us. The hotel was one of the cleanest ones we have ever visited. The place and the neighborhood were quiet and welcoming. The room had everything that we needed. We'll definitively go back there, and we recommend it to those looking for cosy, clean and cost-effective accommodation in Athens.",Date of stay: October 2019,Marble House,4,"Athens, Greece"
"Wonderful environment, delicious dishes, live music, really good service","We visited the place last week and really enjoyed everything there. The weather was warm so we sat outside. The dishes were really good and the staff were so helpful. There was also an amazing duo (bouzouki and guitar) playing live Greek music. We also loved the wine served. To the best of my knowledge, this is a family business and therefore there is a family atmosphere in the restaurant, which we appreaciated. You should visit this place!",Date of visit: October 2019,Aptaliko,4,"Patras, Greece"
"A really unique boat trip, which is a must if you visit Kefalonia!","My wife and I took this trip on board Dimitris and Efi's boat last week and enjoyed it to the full. I cannot overemphasize how satisfied we were with everything offered in the course of the trip. The weather was so nice, the boat was comfortable and amazingly clean, the hosts were so caring, considerate, generous and ready to cater for our needs. They offered us breakfast when we boarded, despite not having promised to do so, to make us feel welcome. There were plenty of cold water, soft drinks, beers and wine on board and they constantly asked us whether we wanted some. In a little while everyone on board felt comfortable enough to help themselves to the fridge! The fishing experience was really cool. Efi and Mohamed (their assistant) were patient while taking the nets on board, to enable us to take part in untangling the fish ourselves and show us how to do that. Efi explained so many things about the different fishes caught and was so patient and eager to answer our questions. I should also stress that Efi did her best to explain everything in English, given that most on board were not Greek speakers, and did a very good job indeed. We also swam in marvelous secluded beaches with crystal clear water, inaccessible from land. My wife took a natural spa bath in a place where natural clay was available in shallow water. She loved it. And here comes the food!!!! Efi and Dimitris chose the best fish caught to prepare a feast for us. The grilled and fried fish was excellent, delicious and abundant. I love fish, so I ate lots of it. Everyone did, and there were leftovers. Dimitris and Efi were always there, attending to the table and ready to help us. And they served us their own wine (given the end of the season, their own wine was limited, so there was also great wine from other local producers available too), beers and soft drinks. Lots of them! The whole experience was incredible, interesting and fantastic, not boring at all. We had such a great time so we want to thank Dimitris and Efi for their kind-heartedness and generosity and wish them all the best! If you visit Kefalonia, do not miss this trip!!!!! It is a must!!!!",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
