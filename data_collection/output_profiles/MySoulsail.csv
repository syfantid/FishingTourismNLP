Wow beautifully stunning weekend break,"The hotel is tucked away in a glorious piece of the country, near the famous Shelsley Walsh hill climb, no you are not disturbed by the noise. A picture postcard place to stay and your hosts Lisa and Kieth are the perfect combination, humorous and knowledgable of the are they live. We had one of their fabulous Morgans for the day, great fun to drive and we opted for the F&M picnic, not to be missed out on.
The rooms are exquisitely decorated very opulent, the food is perfectly served and tastes every bit as good as it looks! There is absolutely nothing I can criticise about this hotel, in fact it was so good I have booked again for next year!! Funny enough I'm even taking the same person with me as a romantic break away!!",Date of stay: September 2020,The Court House Unique Boutique B&B,4,"Shelsley Walsh, United Kingdom"
Just a quick fix,"Oh my word, chill out and sprawl out on the comfy sofas and delight in an assortment of homemade desserts with a coffee! I think Iâ€™ve found a piece of heaven in Loutraki, Skopelos! Eva is the owner and the chef, wow come and drown your taste buds in her yummy grub!
The gin and tonic hits the spot too!",Date of visit: July 2019,Vigla Cafe,4,"Skopelos, Greece"
Amazing Hotel and an excellent Manager Jose,"Beautiful hotel, very convenient for everything in Manado, very helpful staff especially Jose I cannot compliment him enough for his professionalism and just a lovely genuine person. The hotel has great WiFi, clean fresh rooms, very reasonable price, good breakfast and very quiet!",Date of stay: February 2018,Genio Hotel Manado,4,"Manado, Indonesia"
The hotel that time forgot,"We stayed here for a month and we are both seasoned travellers not backpackers, the hotel needs some general maintenance but we found the staff very helpful. The owner is a lady and she is a very gracious, generous and kind person who was incredibly helpful during our stay.
We didn't find any rude staff so I find the comments in some of the reviews here offensive, there are a lot of foreign staff here just like all the hotels in Langkawi. Some of them are working for their lodgings and as such don't seem to do very much, but are more than happy to help where they can.
The hotel does not advertise food and you will have to go out to eat, not a huge problem with the amount of restaurants in Langkawi. The rooms are clean and spacious but the beds are comfortable and the view of the garden is beautiful. It's a quiet spot away from the noise of the beaches and we loved it so much we are going again for another month in December. The wifi is in the reception and no reception in the rooms but we didn't care after all we were on holiday!!
Thank you for our lovely stay Ruth and Angelo x",Date of stay: March 2018,Panorama Langkawi Country Resort,4,"Langkawi, Malaysia"
Busy,"Too many people and lots of hassle from people selling stuff if you like noise and bars its for you, otherwise hire a car/bike and find a better beach!",Date of experience: March 2018,Cenang Beach,4,"Langkawi, Malaysia"
Great Views,Lots of people you just end up behind chain of people and if you are lucky there is a gap where you can see the view before you are in the way of yet another SELFIE!,Date of experience: February 2018,Langkawi Geopark,4,"Langkawi, Malaysia"
Romance,"Go in the evening and it's a little spot in paradise surrounded by fairy lights, great drinks very tasty food a bit pricey but well worth it. Hard to find if your driving easy to pass the entrance",Date of visit: February 2018,The Fat Frog,4,"Langkawi, Malaysia"
Good price and a good hotel,"We arrived just before New Year the kitchen was closed so we had a hard time finding something to eat in Tomohon. The room was in the new block there was no hot water, not the end of the world except the weather was not great so it was a little cold. The staff don't speak very good English but the owner can be called to communicate anything you need. Perfect position if you have transport although a taxi can be called no problem, google maps are not correct so we had a job finding it. We met the owners niece and friends and spent a lovely evening with them even dressing up in Korean traditional costume.
Rooms spacious and clean decorated to a high standard, fantastic WiFi and TV good choice of breakfast as long as you like a little spice!
Thank you for a great stay.",Date of stay: January 2018,Jhoanie Hotel,4,"Tomohon, Indonesia"
Smelly though,"Beautiful spot to see the lake a bit smelly from the sulphur but none the less worth going. We had breakfast here and met some wonderful people who told us more about the area, go for the fried bananas and sweet tea yummy x",Date of experience: February 2018,Lake Linau,4,"Tomohon, Indonesia"
Great place,"You are not in Europe do not expect to be understood, but the staff are very eager to please, it's clean, quiet, good location, good breakfast with an option of omelette for an extra 10. If you are lucky enough to meet the general manager Jose then this is the perfect hotel. He goes out of his way to ensure you have a perfect stay, if you need any information he will find it if he doesn't know the answe!
Would I come back again absolutely and this is the 3rd visit! Jose thank you for your hospitality you are a one in a million manager! Love from Greece",Date of stay: January 2018,Genio Hotel Manado,4,"Manado, Indonesia"
Loved this guy and the day was fabulous...,"If you are a couple, a group of friends big or small and fancy something a bit different then go and see Captain Demitris he is great, jump on board for a trip full of fun. Fishing, swimming and snorkeling relax on deck while the rest catch your lunch, a taverna will cook if you are lucky!!
Amazing day you must go if you are in Skiathos...",Date of experience: June 2017,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Love it.....,"Great spot in the port overlooking the pontoon quiet and away from the traffic tucked in a corner with the most incredible Plain Tree!! Ask them how old it is!!!

Yummy crepes, wholesome breakfast, fabulous coffee not that capsule crap proper beans you can taste the difference!! Soothing music, great wifi, good food and lovely people what more are you looking for.....",Date of visit: September 2016,Petrino Cafe Snack-Bar Pizza,4,"Skopelos, Greece"
