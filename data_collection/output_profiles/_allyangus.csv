Amazing,"We stayed at olive grove last week and visited this restaurant nearly everyday,it is just at the end of the road from the appartments and is amazing especially the freshly squeased orange juice which my little girl loved,my wife was a massive fan of the halloumi and tomatoes.for me it was all about the Greek salads absolutely amazing.if you are in the area then you must visit.Allan Mcintyre",Date of visit: June 2018,Esperides,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
