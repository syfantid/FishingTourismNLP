The highlight of 2 amazing weeks!,"We chose this fishing experience cruise in Polyaigos for the last day of our vacation and we couldn’t have chosen anything better! Captain Nikos and his wife, Froso, are 2 wonderful people who will make you feel the traditional greek hospitality from the first moment on the fishing boat. We did 3 cruises in total during our trip, but THIS one exceeded every other cruise. From the people on board, to the amazing locations of Polyaigos we visited and the best food we ate on board, all these made a wonderful experience that we will treasure! We did 5 stops for swimming in crystal green and blue waters and Froso kept on feeding us wonderful recipes of her own. Our lunch was FRESH fish that Captain Nikos caught in the morning and they made a traditional “Kakavia” (the fishermen’s fish soup). Thank you so much for this gift on an experience and we wish you to continue being as you are!",Date of experience: August 2020,Milos Fishing Experience,4,"Milos, Greece"
MUST visit spot on the island!!!,"The most wonderful place to visit in Folegandros island.

"Excellent and peacefull stay, even on the 25th of March - national Greek celebration","It is the second time visiting 1700 and it wont be the last. We stayed in the hotel for 4 nights during a very popular period (25th of March), but this did not affect the value of calmness of the hotel. The decor, the rooms, the spa, the breakfast and the restaurant in general are all very well cared by the owners and the staff of the hotel. Everyone is caring, polite and friendly. Thank you for another amazing stay!",Date of stay: March 2019,Mikro Papigo 1700 Hotel & Spa,4,"Mikro Papigko, Greece"
A great weekend!,"The hotel is ideal for couples. Great design, spacious rooms with perfect view, friendly staff (with some exceptions as expected). We had a 2night stay at the hotel and we enjoyed all services. The breakfast was absolutely great, the spa was a bit overpriced but the hotel is luxurious so it is logical. We will come back again at some point!",Date of stay: October 2018,Grand Forest Metsovo,4,"Metsovo, Greece"

"If the management's ways changes, it will have potential...","My boyfriend and I visited the guesthouse for a weekend in the beginning of February. The hotel's location is great with an amazing view. We had lunch in the restaurant the first day; the food was relatively good, but the view is everything. Unfortunately on the first night of our stay the heating was completely off (not working at all) and we informed a member of the hotel in order to have it fixed before we went back to our room after our spa. When we returned from the spa (23:30pm), the heating was still broken, plus there was no hairdryer in the room, therefore we had to fire up the fireplace (the woods in the fireplace have been located by a member of the hotel's team) in order to have some heat, as the room was extremely cold. 30' after we put on the fireplace the room got filled with smoke. If we had not woken up fast enough, this event would turn out very bad. In the room there was no fire alarm.
We opened the doors and windows immediately so we could breathe and we called a member of the hotel. When the lady arrived she said that it was our fault that we did not inform her about the broken heating and that we had placed the woods in the wrong way.
Fortunately, she called someone who fixed the problem with the heating and around 3:00am the heating came on. The next morning no one from the hotel showed any kind of regret or any interest, no one even asked us how we were and how we slept after the incident.
All in all, I want to summarize by saying that even though the hotel has a great location, the management of the hotel should change their ways of approaching safety issues and customer services. I am writing this review with all good intentions in order to urge the hotel owners to realize the importance of the hotel's safety (ex. fire alarms).
I am truly happy we were so lucky to have woken up fast and I hope things will change in this hotel, in order not to have a similar incident in the future.",Date of stay: February 2019,Agnanti Traditional Guesthouse,4,"Palaios Panteleimonas, Greece"
We have been lucky to try it!,What an amazing restaurant very close to the center of Katerini. Incredible range of choices both in plates and in wines. Everything we ordered was spectacular and the tsipouro too. We will surely visit Katerini again in order to dine in this restaurant! Congratulations on everything!,Date of visit: February 2019,Amaltheia Restaurant,4,"Katerini, Greece"
