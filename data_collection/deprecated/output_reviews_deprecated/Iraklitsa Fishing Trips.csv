These guys were the best ever. Very knowledgable of the area, excellent command of the language, friendly professional and polite. The food on the boat was simple yet amazing, the most fresh fish you will ever get, with tomatoes with the best aromas and local tsipouro. It was a traditional fishing experience with swimming in private beaches with crystal waters and snorkelling. Absolutely recommend it! I wish there were more than 5 stars!â€¦"
