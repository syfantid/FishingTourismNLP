Amazing from the minute we stepped on the boat!!,"This was an absolutely fantastic experience and I highly recommend it to all, couples, families, single travellers. The owners are so friendly and welcoming. The views sailing out are amazing! We did the sunset trip. Watching the fisherman bring the nets in with our catch was so cool! Being able to swim in the waters while Antonia prepared our Greek version of bruschetta with Tuna & chilled white wine, before the main event.
The fish that was caught, cooked to perfection with sides of spaghetti, potato salad & Greek salad and lobsters!! Sharing the food and wine with fellow visitors, couples and families was such a great experience. Star gazing on the boat and trip back in was out of this world! Such a great trip to take & we will definitely being doing it again the next time we visit the island!!",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
