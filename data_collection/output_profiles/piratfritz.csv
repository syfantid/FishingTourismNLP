Best Milos boat experience with fresh caught fish!,"Beat all the tourists and join this local boat (fishing) tour! We stopped along all the highlights of the west coast of Milos, caught fresh fish and fried them for lunch! A truly great experience that surpasses the other crowded boat tours by far!",Date of experience: September 2019,Milos Fishing Trip,5,"Milos, Greece"
