Spectacular service,"The impeccable service here makes up for it's location being a little far from the city centre. It's for the best anyways, as it's very quiet in these parts and close to the train station terminal. The first night we had problems with the WIFI, but by the following evening they had fixed it completely. Very satisfied.",Date of stay: October 2018,Hotel Tiziano,4,"Venice, Italy"

Simply amazing!,"Our host Anthí was very professional and yet very warm. The captain Mohammed helped showed us the ropes from collecting the crates to scaling the fish. I have only great things to say about the whole experience. If you do only one thing in Santorini, this should be it.",Date of experience: April 2017,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Great views and super friendly staff,"At this time of the year and from this location, we get both the sunset and the sunrise. What a delight! Christos, the manager, will help in any way possible. The rest of the staff is also very serviable.

Room was very clean and quiet. Our bed was a little hard, but I think it's a Greece thing.

All things considered, I would recommend this place if you prefer to be outside of the hustle and bustle of Firá.",Date of stay: April 2017,Nautilus Dome,4,"Santorini, Greece"
