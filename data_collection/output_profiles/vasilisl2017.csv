Join and Enjoy an Unforgettable Fishing Cruise with your Family or Friends!,"We reach the fishplace where we will have the chance to experience fishing with nets not only for Cods, Red-mullets, Scorpion fish, Dentex, Seabreams but also for Lobsters, Norway Lobsters and Crabs. If you like you can help us empty the nets. Only when we pull in the nets do we realise how excited a fisherman gets at the sight of a good catch. You can also experience the magic of fishing with a fishing line
or a fishing rod.

After fishing we steer to a beautiful isolated beach close to the fishing place, which has access only by boat. Meanwhile we empty the nets and we store the fish in ice. We anchor by the beach and there you will enjoy a wonderful swim or snorkelling in the turquoise crystal clear waters while Efthimia will be preparing a delicious meal.

Under the shade of the boat, feeling the sea breeze we enjoy a good lunch made of the fish we caught, fresh organic vegetables from our garden, olive-oil from our olive grove and homemade wine of fine quality made from our organic grape vine.",Date of experience: June 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
