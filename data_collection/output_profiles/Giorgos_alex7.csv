Just perfect!,"Canâ€™t ask for anything more! Amazing experience for a second time after 2 years. Trip to the best areas and sites around Skiathos plus the excitement and fun of the fishing experience (either for lovers of the hobby or novice). Dimitris is an amazing host, always making you feel welcome, doing his best for your joy and comfort. Boat is specious and sturdy; combined with an experienced seaman offers the most comfortable experience and fun of such a trip. Strongly recommend! Also toddler friendly.",Date of experience: September 2019,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
