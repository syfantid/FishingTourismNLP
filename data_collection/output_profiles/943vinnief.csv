Athens - Private Greek Evening - Drinks and Bites at Local Taverns,"Kabalan is a very interesting and fun personality. He took me to
several spots that I never would have found on my own. He introduced
me to Raki. Actually, I had multiple introductions. If you like some
drinking, small bites and conversation he's the guide for you.",Date of experience: July 2019,Private Greek Evening Like a Local: Drinks and Tavernas,2,"Athens, Greece"
Athens Private Tour - Hidden Gems,"Ariadni really knows the city and history. Her English was perfect.
She was very flexible. I had already visited a couple of the areas
where she planned to take me. So she customized the route and I saw
many of the hidden gems that were promised. I highly recommend her.
This is not for the main attractions. This is for the other sights you might not otherwise see.",Date of experience: July 2019,Withlocals Highlights & Hidden Gems: Covid-19 Regulated Private Tour in Athens,2,"Athens, Greece"
Hotel and Restaurant,Stayed with a tour group. The rooms and courtyard / restaurant were quite nice. The food was fabulous and a cooking class was arranged for us. It's just 1 block from the beach. They can arrange guided kayaking for your group and other activities. The town is about a 20 minute walk or 5 Euro taxi ride. And easy to get to if you rent motor bikes. 2 wheel and quads available a block away.,Date of visit: June 2019,Odyssey Poros,2,"Poros, Greece"
Ruins,Not much to see. The ruins were picked over in the past so no real structures. It's on the opposite side of the island. It's free so if you are taking a motor bike tour it's okay for a quick walk through but I wouldn't pay to just go there unless you are an archaeology buff.,Date of experience: June 2019,Temple of Poseidon,2,"Poros, Greece"
Go for the view,The clock tower is not much to see but the view of Poros is fabulous. Be prepared to climb a lot of stairs. Along the way you will see much of the town.,Date of experience: June 2019,Clock Tower,2,"Poros, Greece"
Fantastic Octopus,We had both the grilled and marinated octopus. We were on a mission to find the best and this restaurant was recommended. They were both fantastic. Perfectly prepared.,Date of visit: June 2019,Poseidon taverna,2,"Poros, Greece"
Poros Greece Fishing & Meal,Fantastic experience. Lines were already baited. We just pulled in the fish and our Captain Giannis then cooked the fish we caught and served lots of other food. And we got to swim in the sea. Very pleasant 1/2 day on the water.,Date of experience: June 2019,Poseidon Fishing Trips,2,"Poros, Greece"
