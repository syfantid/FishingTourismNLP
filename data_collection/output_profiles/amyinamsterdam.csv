The BEST day out!!!,"Our family of 6 (spanning the generations - from 84 year old Grandpa right down to our 7 year old) headed out with Dimitri and Efi today and I can't say enough good things about the entire experience. We had a lovely friendly welcome and were straight away offered a delicious breakfast spread (Efi's bread with homemade jam; delicious!). We were joined by another family of four (who had returned for a second year running, which says a lot about how great it is), making up the 10 maximum that the boat is allowed. It is the perfect number - convivial but never feeling crowded. We headed out to two nets first, to winch them in and help separate the catch from the nets. The kids and adults loved it and Efi and Dimitri are very knowledgable, teaching you about each fish that you come across. They answered all of our questions in lots of detail - it was a fascinating insight in to the working life of fishermen (and women!). They are absolute natural with the kids, making sure they are safe but also making sure they have tonnes of fun too. After the nets were in we headed off to stop at a series of remote beaches, where we jumped off the boat and swam ashore, while Efi prepared the lunch. And the lunch was out of this world - huge amounts of food to go round and such a privilege to have such a wide range of the freshest fish that we'd just helped to haul in then prepared by experts for us. Efi's garden provides the rest, from the homemade wine right down to the pickled samphire on the salad. Huge wedges of watermelon rounded the day off as we buzzed back to the harbour. All in all it was the best day of our holiday, hands down!",Date of experience: July 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Totally Brilliant!,"We booked this not quite sure what to expect but I can't recommend it enough; the entire team there were faultlessly polite, accommodating and (most importantly) all over the safety aspect. They were fully engaged, gently coaxing the more nervous kids and messing about with the confident ones - no sulking on the sides like atypical teenage lifeguards. As for the activity itself, it is brilliant - like Pat Sharp's Fun House but on water. You can jump, flip and go nuts off the floats (and lots of kids and parents were!) but there's a place too for taking it steady if you want to just hang out with your kids while they chuck themselves at it. We went on a really mizzly day in August (no warmer than 18oC outside) but as long as you keep moving you won't get cold in wetsuits. We went with our 8 and 6 year old and it totally worked and it would be a dream for any kid 8+.",Date of experience: August 2017,Dorset Adventure Park,5,"Corfe Castle, United Kingdom"
