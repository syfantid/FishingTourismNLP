Interesting,"It is an interesting place, but mostly in the cold season. In august it's dry (the soil is still wet, technically mud, watch out!), no salt at all in the area and the flamingos are coming from october to march. Also, there are no tourist signs for this place, just the location on google maps. try to go with a local.",Date of experience: August 2019,Alikes Salt Lakes Tigaki,4,"Kós, Greece"

Unforgettable experience,"Nothing compares to catch your first fish ever! I spent 4 awsome hours on this trip and I loved it! The team of Captain Tasos is really nice, funny and they know to entertain you even you sre not the luckiest fisherman on Earth A great point is that we took the fish we caught to a restaurant where they cooked it for us for free, we paid only for the drinks and other dishes. It's a must and unforgettable experience if you go to Kos",Date of experience: July 2019,Captain Tasos,4,"Kós, Greece"
