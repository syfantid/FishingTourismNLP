Great family day out!,"Captain Dimitris and his crew were fab! We spent the morning out fishing off Skopelos island and caught loads of 'kolios' fish. Our 6 year old son had never caught a fish before and was supper excited! We all had a go and it was really fun. After a bite of lunch we were off to the island of Tsoungria with its crystal clear & shallow waters for a leasurely dip and a really relaxing afternoon was had by all.
