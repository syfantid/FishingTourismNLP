Donâ€™t get there 10 min before closing,"They shut down the coffee machine. I arrived at 8:50, 10 min before closing and the coffee machine was already off:(
I wanted Coffee and a crepe for dessert after a great pizza at Blaze, next door but the crepe place closes early.",Date of visit: April 2019,Sweet Paris,1,"College Station, Texas"
Fishing trip in Santorini,"Best fishing trip ever! My 13 yr old son wanted to go fishing and we contacted Giorgaros fishing trip with our hotel Consierge. They were amazing and very professional a true family experience. My son loves to learn about the different fish in the area and we caught an amazing variety in the local way. Nets were set a day ahead and we harvested them the day of the trip, we caught lots of shrimp, cuddle fish, octopus and many fish varieties. They fried some shrimp on the boat and provided lunch for us. It does not get any fresher than that!!
Big hurray for Giorgaros fishing tours for allowing us to join in their local fishing experience:) We will definitely come back.",Date of experience: June 2017,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,1,"Santorini, Greece"
