Santorini Fishing Tour with Anthi,"Amazing experience with Anthi and her crew. A total of 8 people were on the trip, each picked up from various locations on the island and dropped off at the harbor. Anthi explained what we would be doing, she was very personable and her crew was amazing. We swam in amazing water, caught fish and shrimp which was grilled and fried on the spot, and served with fresh salad rice and grilled veggies. One of the tastiest meals we had in santorini. I would definitely do it again. Anthi, Marcos and Mohammed thank you for such a memorable experience.",Date of experience: May 2019,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
