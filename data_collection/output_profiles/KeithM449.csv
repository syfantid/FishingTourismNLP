Great bike rental at Bikeiberia Lisbon,"Rented a bike for 1 1/2 days, staff super helpful and friendly. Good price (â‚¬25 - I overran on time but they wouldn't charge me) for nice quality bike.

Poor food quality and service,"We have been here a few times since it opened and the experience has been generally been pretty good with pleasant food and a good alternative to the Mogul.

So unfortunately we won't be returning any time soon.",Date of visit: April 2013,Nirala Tandoori,4,"Manningtree, United Kingdom"
