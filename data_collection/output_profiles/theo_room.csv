Top experience,This is the best way to discover the beaches of Milos. You can't ask for more - eating fish you caught yourself freshly bbqed on the boar's very own grill after snorkelling in the crystal clear azure blue waters around Kleftiko! The fishing caique is authentic and so comfortable with plenty of room for our group and shade for everyone (we saw many boats crowded with people and were so happy we had made this choice). You are so well looked after by the captain and his daughter! The captain takes you to his special spots - we even saw endangered turtles and dolphins swimming with the boat! We recommend this as a MUST! Looking forward to doing this again the next time we are in Milos!,Date of experience: August 2019,Milos Fishing Trip,5,"Milos, Greece"
