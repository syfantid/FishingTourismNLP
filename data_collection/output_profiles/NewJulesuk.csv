Saturday 15/06/2019 Julie & Moira,"What a great and memorable day. Collected from our hotel by the very lovely, friendly and warm Antonia. Supplied with coffee and cake served by the fabulous fisherman Hassan while the rest of our fellow shipmates arrived. Just 12 of us which meant getting to know one another whilst sailing out to haul the catch. What a lovely group of people. Hassan had willing helpers (bit of a boy thing!) to extract the lobster etc from the nets as we sailed to a lovely cove for a swim/rest. All followed by an amazing banquet of bruschetta Greek style, ingredients from Antonia's garden, Michalis's cured tuna and THEN a wonderful fish soup and the best lobster spaghetti EVER from the catch all cooked on board by Michalis and Antonia. The wine courtesy of Michalis father flowed along with the conversation/repartee. Antonia had explained the lobster fishing process over the day and answered questions in an unassuming way and was the perfect hostess. She engulfed us all in a warm embrace to send us on our way when we arrived back at the marina. And that pretty much sums up how this trip felt from beginning to end. What a marvellous day and memory of Kefalonia.",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
