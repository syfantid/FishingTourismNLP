Chill Out,"1st time in Cape Verdi. Just wanted a chill out week with good weather and everything at hand.
That's exactly what we got.
A good standard 4* I would say.
Beautiful hotel .Very clean with friendly staff.
Food good but missed being served . All the restaurants are buffet style. Be good if one was a served restaurant.
Also wine only on tap. Would have liked decent bottles to be on offer especially in the restaurants.
On the whole we had a lovely time and would recommend.",Date of stay: March 2019,Hotel Riu Touareg,1,"Boa Vista, Cape Verde"

The little touches make a difference.
The complex very relaxing . People very friendly and a good maintenance programme in place.
Thank you Shirley for the restaurant recommendations.
Ascension, Fifteen, Fado Steak was our favourite. Fabulous food.

The only negative thing for us was the view. We really like sitting out on a balcony but you faced a concrete wall.
Spent a lot of time round the pool which was quiet and relaxing.
The harbour and beach area excellent to.

Overall we had a lovely stay .",Date of stay: November 2018,Premium Apartment Castillo Mar,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Welcome Change Of Management,"We are locals and stopped going in the Ring O Bells for a few years due to place being fifthy and how it was allowed to serve food is beyond me.
A few months ago we started to notice how better the pub was starting to look externally so thought we would call in for a drink.
Greeted by the new landlord behind the bar who was very pleasant welcoming and appreciated us as locals coming back into the pub.
The whole place is so much better and cleaner and you can see the new management are making changes to improve standards.
Previous comments made saying the food is expensive is totally unjustified when you compare to other pubs serving food in Marple.
A welcome change for us and wish the new management team all the best .
Keep up the good work.",Date of visit: August 2018,Ring O Bells,1,"Marple, United Kingdom"
Won’t be back,"Visited tonight for early tea about 5.30. Just 4 people in the whole pub.. My husband and I ordered food at the bar and sat down. Food arrived which was very nice. The young girl asked if we would like anything else. My husband asked if it was possible for another pint( Baring in mind the pub was empty). She hesitated then replied” I can on this occasion but next you will have to go to the bar”
So rude and totally unnecessary to be spoken to like that. Her attitude was terrible. Very poor customer service. Jumped up little Madame. There is to much competition to have very rude staff. Hence we won’t be back.
Shame as the food was very nice.
I don’t normally complain but will not be spoken to in that manor.",Date of visit: April 2018,The Red Lion,1,"Stockport, United Kingdom"
Excellent,"Been to Peruga a few times now. Always delivers. Food, service impeccable. The tribute evening good to . Great value for money. Standards are high and Franco and his team so professional and provide a great service. Best restaurant in the area .",Date of visit: November 2017,Peruga,1,"Marple, United Kingdom"
Lovely Hotel,"Booked as a relaxing break with another couple who had been previously and recommended to us. Don't normally do all inclusive but got to say it was so worth it. The standards were excellent. All branded drinks and the food very good. Good variety of food on offer in the buffet restaurant.The hotel was lovely and clean spotless everywhere we went. Glad we went in May just before the season starts as the lsat few days were really busy round the pool.
We didn't have a sea view room but couldn't complain as the room was excellent The only downside was the beach. Really bad under foot and not suitable for for access into the sea. Needs more sand and better access. I imagine in high season the pool area is really congested as the beach is a no go. It's a real shame.
I would definitely return as overall at great hotel with high standards.",Date of stay: May 2017,H10 Estepona Palace,1,"Estepona, Spain"
Poor management customer service,"Tried to redeem a Groupon voucher . Gave the security number and my mobile number then booked the table for 6.30 the same evening. Short notice but thank you for the reservation.
Arrived to be told the voucher was not valid. So we then had to leave. Once home a rang the manager just to confirm the code was correct. The code was written down wrong which is an easy mistake but the fact that nobody even rung me to say there was a problem is really poor. My conversation then with the manager I was made to feel it was my fault. He put the correct code in the machine which was excepted. So we have had no meal but you have been paid.
Note to the manager your people's skills are terrible hence we won't be returning and I have made Groupon aware of your poor customer service.",Date of visit: April 2017,The Purple Pakora Marple,1,"Marple, United Kingdom"
Great Location,Our first time in Cape Town. Stayed for 4 nights . Couldn't have asked for a better hotel. Great location just off the V&A Waterfront. Stayed in a deluxe room which was excellent. My case was lost from the transfer from Johannesburg. The staff were really helpful and sympathetic as I was very upset . The reception staff were really helpful to my husband ringing South African Airlines for information. My suitcase finally arrived after 36 hours. Breakfast very nice with plenty of selection. The room service was great to. Good value for money.,Date of stay: October 2016,The PortsWood,1,"Cape Town Central, South Africa"
Lucky Locals,How lucky are we to have The Crown on our door step. Seen a lot of changes over the years but got to say it's now at its best. We must visit at least once a week now . Good atmosphere welcoming staff and great food. Must have been through the whole menu now so would be good to introduce a special board to provide a bit more variety . Keep up the good work Lin and the team.,Date of visit: May 2016,The Crown,1,"Marple, United Kingdom"

Had fish and chips they were lovely.The afternoon tea looked amazing. Would defiantly like to book a short break here.,Date of stay: September 2015,The Swan Hotel & Spa,1,"Newby Bridge, United Kingdom"
Not Bad,Nice and clean.Liked the idea of the honesty bar.Car park small but had no problem finding a space on the road.Rooms quite small.The beds really comfy.One thing that spoilt it for me was being rushed out of the room .We had over slept and told we had 20 minutes to be out of the room.Not good customer service to my opinion.,Date of stay: August 2015,Mode Hotel St Annes,1,"Lytham St Anne's, United Kingdom"
Great value,We went at lunchtime and had the set menu for 10 euros.Really nice and 1.20 euro a large beer.The bill csme to 27 euros which included 2 3 course meals and 4 large beers . Great value,,Bacchus,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Great food,Sirloin steak in peppercorn sauce so delicious and beautifully cooked.12.50 euro you can't go wrong.Was one of the cheapest bills we had for 2 of us but the best food .,,Casa Blanca,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
You get what you pay for!,"Can't really fall out with these apartments for what we paid.Good location accessible to everything. Clean enough but the beds were only done once while we were there.
Avoid the rooms above the bar as can be really noisy at night .The music starts at 12 and is constant all day till 5 without a break.It then starts again about 7 till midnight.The speakers were right below us so a bit of consideration to the apartments above the bar wouldn't go a miss.
Nice little pool but the sunbeds were so uncomfortable .Definitely need upgrading.
Also having to pay for an iron, microwave, tv not good.Put a bit more on the room price and include them.
Loved the resort and would definitely go back but would probably try somewhere different.
If your looking for a base on a budget then these apartments fit the bill",Date of stay: September 2014,Oceano Apartments,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Great value for money. Very friendly hotel.,"Our 4th time over the years. Took our family this time to experience this great hotel . They loved it. How people complain is beyond me.I wasn't happy with my room when I arrived but was moved straight away without any fuss . This hotel caters for everyone young and old . Great food option's. How much fresh meat and fish do you want ?romantic fantastic as always . burgers round the pool yummy . If you can't find something to eat to suit you here you must be a very fussy person.I never saw fresh food uncovered.
Please ignore bad reviews and go and make your own mind up.You won't be disappointed. This hotel has a great atmosphere and the most friendly staff who will do anything for you.I have been to all the other Caribbean islands but you can't meet Cuban people.",Date of stay: October 2013,"Hotel Playa Pesquero Resort, Suite & Spa",1,Cuba
You get what you pay for,After reading the reviews I was dreading staying here. Tried to cancel numerous times.Stayed for 2 nights over the bank holiday.Got there Sat at 1 o'clock parked up no problem got a permitt. Took 5 mins to check in.No problem at all.Was allocated rooms on the 6th floor.Room clean with a whirlpool bath.Phew!!!!!! Could now relax and enjoy my weekend. Yes the hotel is tired and needs a good overhall but is a fantastic building. We paid 140 pound for 2 nights bed an breakfast. Didn't eat in the hotel just used as a base.Dont think I could of stayed full board but have no complaints about our stay.,Date of stay: August 2013,Grand Hotel Scarborough,1,"Scarborough, United Kingdom"
"""Lovely Holiday""","I have stayed at a few hotels over the years in the Caribbean and this hotel is not the best or the worst i have stayed in.The Catalonia has a great atmosphere and is spotless.Some of the reviews i have read are extremely harsh.The only thing that lets this hotel down is the upgrade and priviledge nonsense. All rooms should be of a good standard and provide a fridge,kettle,safe.Luckily we had a standard room with a fridge and a huge 7ft bed. Apparently all the standard rooms are under going a face lift.

The only thing i would suggest is that the hotel should make more use of the terrace were the Mexican and the Italian restaurants are.Be lovely to sit out at night up there and over look the sea.

All in all great had a great 2 weeks and wouldn,t rule out going back if i saw a good deal.",Date of stay: October 2011,Catalonia Riviera Maya,1,"Puerto Aventuras, Mexico"
"""Not to be missed""",5 mins walk from the hotel.A change from being in the hotel all the time. Nice restaurants and good food.See the dolphins and sea lions free of charge,Date of experience: October 2011,Puerto Aventuras Marina,1,"Puerto Aventuras, Mexico"
