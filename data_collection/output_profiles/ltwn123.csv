Not your average boat trip,"Well, what can I say. Antonia and Michalis make you feel so welcome. From the moment you board the whole experience is a pleasure. Coffee and cake followed by a trip to bring in the 3km of nets. You are free to get as involved as you like and then there is time to swim, fish & enjoy the sun whilst Antonia serves up bruschetta and home made wine. Then after more sun and free time the largest freshest feast appears before your eyes. We met some fabulous people on board and it was the highlight of our holiday. Not your average boat trip, I can highly recommend. Many thanks Antonia and Michalis - we loved it.",Date of experience: October 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
