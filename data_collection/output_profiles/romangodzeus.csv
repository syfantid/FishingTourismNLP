Unique experience!,We loved our time on Michaelis fishing boat and it was a real experience seeing trawler fishing in action. Once the nets were up we moored in a cove and went snorkelling whilst the crew prepared the fish and lobster they’d caught. The seafood pasta they served was probably the best we had all holiday!,Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Beautiful natural beach with great snorkelling,"We found this beach on our last day in Greece and loved it! It’s a bit off the beaten track with quite a steep drive down, but there’s a small car park at the bottom and then a path down to the beach itself.

If you’re keen on snorkelling there’s plenty to explore including deep pools, rocky shallows and a narrow ravine. We saw lots of fish and even an octopus. The beach itself is completely rocky but has a few preinstalled sun beds and parasols for free use. Water shoes definitely come in useful.

Without doubt the best beach of our holiday!",Date of experience: September 2019,Amandakis Beach,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Small but fun!,"Water Village provides something for everyone catering for all ages from toddler to grand parent. It’s not the largest park with the main rides contained at one end but it does make it easy to go from one to the other. The half pipe, tower, black hole and affectionately named (at least by us) toilet bowl rides were all worth the entrance fee and we spent a good 5 or 6 hours enjoying ourselves.

Food as ever at these places is terrible and best avoided. Lockers are also very small so only take the essentials. There are however plenty of free sun beds snd parasols so easy to rest up while the kids wear themselves out!",Date of experience: August 2019,Water Village,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Great food with beautiful views,"Stopped at El Sueno on the way back to the little port of Agios Nikolaos. It’s a lovely restaurant with a varied menu and stunning views out over the sea. Service is great as were all the dishes we tried - particular favourites were the starters of prawns with feta, and deep fried feta with tomato jam!",Date of visit: August 2019,El Sueno,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Fantastic food and great service,"Il Borgo is a delightful restaurant situated at the top of the hill just below St George’s Castle. You get lovely views out over the coast and beyond to Zakynthos plus a refreshing breeze if you eat late enough. The menu has all the traditional Greek dishes plus pasta, burgers for the kids but all served beautifully. Undoubtedly the best restaurant we’ve enjoyed on our trip.",Date of visit: August 2019,il Borgo,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Natural beauty, but busy!","Myrtos is a fabulously beautiful beach and definitely worth a visit. The sea almost doesn’t look real with the white rock below reflecting through the water to turn it acquamarine.

The drive down is fine until you get to the bottom, which is pretty congested. Better to leave the car on the side of the road and walk the last bit. The beach itself is large and pebbley with virtually no shade. There’s a small beach bar there too which is useful for drinks and snacks.",Date of experience: August 2019,Myrtos Beach,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Holiday highlight!,"Great experience taking the family out on the water with lots of small beaches and coves only accessible by sea to explore. The boat was decent and well maintained and had more than enough power for the trip. Instructions were brief so it helps if you know the basics (knots, anchoring, navigation). A definite holiday highlight!",Date of experience: August 2019,Fiskardo Boat Hire,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Relaxed seaside charm,There’s a lot to like about Sami with a relaxed vibe and many sea front bars and restaurants. The locals seem friendly enough but it’s a bit touristy in places and some of the restaurants are definitely below par. Choose wisely.,Date of experience: August 2019,Port of Sami,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Comfortable but flawed,"We stayed one night after a weekend sailing. Lots of positives - very comfortable rooms, complimentary gin/sherry, courteous staff and a well equipped spa.

However, watch out when requesting dinner. It seems the main restaurant is run by a separate company and not part of the hotel. We asked for dinner at check-in but they had no record of our booking. Luckily managed to get a table on the top floor restaurant but the menu is pretty limited in comparison.",Date of stay: August 2018,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,4,"Southampton, United Kingdom"
Perfection!,"Kingfisher is right up there with some of the best holiday restaurant experiences you can have. The tone is set right from the start with attentive service and careful explanation of each dish.

The food is of course exquisite - from Asian influenced Cervice and traditional Polpo Romesco, through to seafood mains such as Mediterranean Seafood Soup, Sea Bream and even Fish’n’Chips. Perhaps the best thing though is the G&T menu! Book in advance.",Date of visit: August 2018,Kingfisher Restaurant,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Crystal clear waters ideal for snorkelling,"Tucked away under the cliff the beach itself is not much to look at, being small and stony. But the waters in the bay are something else - crystal clear and ideal for snorkelling. There’s even a natural waterfall you can wash off under afterwards.

Getting there requires a bit of effort, but if you get lucky you can park close to the steps leading down. Failing that, there’s parking in the town above.",Date of experience: August 2018,Cala Banyalbufar,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Explore coastal Mallorca by sea,"6 of us joined Ramiro on his yacht to snorkel some of the coves that are inaccessible by land. He is the perfect host and made sure we were well looked after with cold drinks on board.

The boat itself comfortably sat all of us and there was a sun cover giving some welcome shade. Ramiro also has a paddleboard which our children loved using.

Loved it so much we’re booking a yachting course back in the UK!",Date of experience: August 2018,Let's Sail,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Delightful alfresco dining,"This is a family friendly restaurant that serves delightful, authentic food. Dishes range from traditional Spanish (polpo, paella) through to Italian (bolognese, lasagne). A table on the terrace is preferred.",Date of visit: August 2018,Sa Aturada,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Something for everyone but thrillseekers may be underwhelmed,"Spent a very enjoyable day out here with the family. Fast Pass was worth the extra and can be used on about 9 rides. Helped us get to the front quickly although red rubber ring system is a bit confusing initially.

Lots of shade to chill out in. Yellow and Orange flumes plus the half pipe were voted the best by the more adventurous in our party (teenagers) although they bemoaned the lack of really terrifying rides!",Date of experience: August 2018,Western Water Park,4,"Majorca, Spain"
A break from the usual,If you fancy something a little different from the usual holiday fare then head to Noname. Fusion food but all done extremely well. Gyoza/BBQ Prawns and Bao bun starters are a must. Diverse mains but child friendly options available too. 9 of us ate (including 5 children) and all enjoyed!,Date of visit: August 2018,Noname,4,"Majorca, Spain"
"Beautiful sands, clear blue sea","Plaja Formentor offers something for everyone: sandy beaches, pine trees, beach bars, restaurants and most importantly parking! Not the cheapest trip to the beach but worth the money.",Date of experience: August 2018,Formentor Playa,4,"Majorca, Spain"
"Beautiful setting, let down by average food","Managed to get a table here at the end of the day having spent an enjoyable afternoon at Cala Deia. The restaurant has great views over the bay and it’s a wonderful place to unwind over a beer. The food is a let down though, expensive and overcooked. Shame, promised so much more.",Date of visit: July 2018,Ca's Patro March,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Does not disappoint,"Finally managed to get a table at this restaurant at the third time of asking. It's small and therefore fills up quickly with a longish waiting list for tables. The food though is worth the wait - we had kimchi and smacked cucumber to begin and then 4 different bao buns with from pork belly, prawn, chicken and tofu. All very delicious and great value. The best news is that they're expanding next door too so hoping that will improve the wait times!",Date of visit: September 2017,Mr. Bao,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Unexpectedly great food!,"Whilst not much to look at from the outside, this restaurant turned out to be a great find. Food is not typically Spanish, with far eastern influences and unusual combinations of ingredients. We tried tuna tartare, seared beef (exceptional), chicken tacos and cerviche. All wonderfully presented and great to eat. Definitely recommended if you want something a bit different.",Date of visit: August 2017,Lubora Madrid Bistro,4,"Madrid, Spain"
Alfresco dining in the medieval old town,"If you're after authentic Spanish cuisine set in beautiful surroundings then look no further! This is one beautiful restaurant that serves seafood and tapas that is off the scale. We started with padron peppers that came with dauphinoise potato, salt cod stuffed peppers with melted cheese and an ambitious provolone, egg and meat dish. For mains the classic paella is not to be missed, coming with langoustine, mussels and clams. The wine was chilled to perfection and balanced the meal wonderfully. Plenty of options for the children too with spaghetti bolognese, chicken nuggets and frites all available. Probably the best restaurant we've visited this holiday.",Date of visit: August 2017,La Terrassa d'Empuries,4,"L'Escala, Spain"
Great value authentic Spanish tapas!,"This restaurant has some of the best seafood tapas we've tried. Razor clams, octopus, anchovies, squid, clams - all beautifully served and tasted great. Kids eat well too with safe options like pasta bolognese and breaded chicken with fries. Amazing value too when compared to other restaurants in the area - 8 of us ate for €120!",Date of visit: August 2017,Restaurant Felix,4,"L'Estartit, Spain"
Spectacular views from the ramparts,It's a long walk up but well worth the effort when you get to the top. You get the added bonus of climbing up one of the towers too so that you can walk round the slightly vertigo inducing ramparts. Start early when it's hot.,Date of experience: August 2017,Castle of Montgrí,4,"Torroella de Montgri, Spain"
Top quality tapas!,"Found this place whilst driving to Platja Fonda a little further on from Begur (also recommended). Tapas is varied and vermicelli prawns are a must, together with octopus and salt cod carpaccio. Kids can eat well too with child friendly burgers and chicken nuggets available. Our waitress was lovely and helped to round off a great little lunch.",Date of visit: August 2017,El Bistro de Begur,4,"Begur, Spain"
Family friendly thrills!,"Aqua Brava is a great place to spend a day out with the family. We visited on a hot day in August, peak season, when the park was at its busiest but still had a lot of fun. There were a few long queues (Cobra and Anaconda particularly) but most rides moved fairly quickly. The White Hole is undoubtedly the most exciting water slide followed by Kamikaze. Whilst the park doesn't have as many high octane thrills as others, it more than makes up for it by providing something for everyone. The Rio Grande and the Rio Danube were also recommended by those in our party looking for fun rather than adrenaline. Go and you won't be disappointed!",Date of experience: August 2017,Aquabrava,4,"Roses, Spain"
Family friendly pizza,"This is a great place to take the family, with many child friendly pizza and pasta options. The food is good quality and the service friendly, if a little chaotic. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.",Date of visit: August 2017,Gelatone Giardinetto,4,"L'Estartit, Spain"
Average restaurant that promises so much more,"Toc Al Mar has one of the best beachside locations you can imagine, overlooking the beautiful rocky bay of Aiguabrava. Unfortunately the food doesn't live up to expectations and is both overpriced and unimaginative (e.g. a main of 6 grilled prawns for €24). Don't bother going with young children, there's very little on the menu for them. It's a shame, it could be so much better but there are other places to eat that are more worthwhile.",Date of visit: August 2017,Toc Al Mar,4,"Begur, Spain"
Little gem that's not to be missed,"Stumbled on this place with friends and family and were lucky enough to get a table for 9 upstairs. Don't be put off by the roadside location, this is a treat not to be missed. Starters were varied covering everything from iberico ham, bruschetta and calamari through to tuna carpaccio with wasabi ice cream (a must for sushi lovers!) Mains were equally eclectic with child friendly choices such as chicken tikka masala, and fried egg 'n' chips. The more traditional Pal rice casserole is definitely recommended - similar to paella but with a more intense flavour. All rounded off with Tempranillo rosé. Staff were attentive and friendly throughout, making the whole experience all the more enjoyable.",Date of visit: August 2017,ANTIC CASINO,4,"Pals, Spain"
Something for everyone,"Found this charming restaurant having spent the day on the beach nearby. It's busy, but the staff are attentive and we didn't wait long for our food. Huge range of dishes to choose from - pizza, tapas, pasta - all beautifully presented and wonderful to taste. Definitely recommend and we'll probably return this holiday!",Date of visit: July 2017,L'Esculapi Restaurant-Pizzeria,4,"L'Escala, Spain"
"Relaxed, friendly modern Indian cuisine","Chose this restaurant on the basis of previous good reviews - and they weren't wrong. We went for Tasting Menu 2 which kicked off well with a crisp white wine, deep fried soft shell crab and a Bombay Chaat (sweet ball filled with yogurt). All gorgeous. Main courses were equally good, beef, tandoori chicken and dal served with a good quality red. Desert rounded it off nicely. Would definitely go again and a great place to take friends and family.",Date of visit: June 2017,Mint and Mustard,4,"Taunton, United Kingdom"
Awesome meal in great surroundings,If you feel like a blow out and treating yourself to a true gourmet meal then look no further! Our night at Le Loup Blanc started with aperol aperitifs followed swiftly by a starter of bone marrow. Unctuous and delicious in every way. For mains we had the steak with fried fois gras. Our children were well catered for with cheeseburgers and fries plus ice cream for desert. The only downside was that we had to vacate our table a bit early for the second sitting. Highly recommended but be prepared to pay for the experience.,Date of visit: February 2017,Le Loup Blanc,4,"Saint-Chaffrey, France"
Relaxed alfresco dining in Denia's old town,"Stumbled on this place on our final day in Denia. It's located on a great little street packed with restaurants and bars so your chances of actually getting in somewhere significantly increase if you haven't already booked. We ate early so the restaurant was pretty quiet until 9:30 when the locals turn up in force. We ordered grilled lamb, T-bone steak, and grilled seasonal vegetables for mains - all great with generous portion sizes. Desserts went down well too, especially the Chocolate Brownie. If you're after relaxed alfresco dining then look no further!",Date of visit: August 2016,Els Tomassets,4,"Denia, Spain"
Decent Italian food in bustling central location,"If your kids love pizza then they'll love this place, serving thin and crispy bases topped with fresh ingredients. They stretch to pasta and other standard Italian dishes too. All served quickly to tables located right on the tree lined Marqués de Campo so you can really soak up the late evening atmosphere. Nothing spectacular, but if you're looking for kid friendly food this place is worth a visit.",Date of visit: August 2016,Lungo Mare Ristorante,4,"Denia, Spain"
Post-platja sundowner drinks,"Great little place to stop off at after a hot day on the nearby Les Rotes-A. Get yourself a cool beer on a table outside and watch the sun go down. Tapas is basic and worth getting as a snack, but there are better places to go for a main meal. If you take it for what it is, it's lovely place to unwind before heading elsewhere.",Date of visit: August 2016,Helios,4,"Denia, Spain"
Beautiful beach-side restaurant location serving great paella,"Booking in advance is a must with this place, especially if you want the paella which needs to be ordered in advance. We weren't disappointed and the huge dish of it that arrived at our table tasted incredible. Desserts were really well presented with a range of ice cream for the kids. Only downside was the rosé wine which was a little sweet for the palette but no reflection on an otherwise superb restaurant.",Date of visit: August 2016,Restaurant Estanyo,4,"Denia, Spain"
"Fabulous family meal, just off the beaten track","Great find, seriously recommend to anyone looking for authentic Spanish cuisine. The best tapas we've eaten here by a long way, coupled with great wine and friendly waiting staff. Intimate atmosphere, but kids also very welcome it seems. Make sure to order the Gambas! Can't wait to go again!",Date of visit: August 2016,For Amur,4,"Denia, Spain"
Great day out with the kids,"Despite some initial trepidation it turns out that Acqualandia is actually a holiday high point. Yes there are crowds milling in the scorching sunshine, all queuing for the same rides, but none of it seems to matter too much when you're having this much fun. Don't bother with money, sunglasses, towels etc, just cream up at the lockers and then head in wearing speedos and a pair of flip flops (you can drop them before each ride). Notable rides - Zig Zag, Big Bang, Pistos Banderos, Rapidos and then float down the lazy river!",Date of experience: August 2016,Aqualandia,4,"Benidorm, Spain"
