an absolutely perfect day,"we decided to opt for this boat trip after reading great reviews about it, and it didn't disappoint.
Antonia is a lovely lady and we were made so welcome from the moment we stepped onto the boat.
imagine watching your lunch being caught, and holding the catch (if you choose to) to seeing it being prepared and cooked for you.
and better still, we were able to swim when the lunch was cooking.
desert was fresh fruit from Antonias gardens, and the wine was home made by her father-in-law.
I have done many boat trips in many different countries and have to say this is my favourite trip by far.
we will be seeing Antonia and crew next year for sure!",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
a must if you are in Lixouri,"we visited this restaurant in June 2019 and had the most amazing seafood risottos.
my partner had the mussels and I had the prawns. both were delicious.
the lady that served us brought us 2 small complimentary fish soups to try, and when we went to pay the bill we were told as we were over 20 euros, that our drinks were free.",Date of visit: June 2019,Mimoza,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
great find,"La Calma was only 10 minutes walk from our apartment so we ate here 4 times.
the food was excellent each time - the special was my favourite, I opted for this every time it was on. but my partner tried other dishes and really enjoyed them.
we will be back for dinner next year :)",Date of visit: June 2019,La Calma,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
A must if you are in Svorenata,"myself and partner were here and had the most amazing meal (the price was great too)
but the pièce de résistance for us was when the waiter picked oranges from the trees and let us try them.
we were also offered a bag to go pick some oranges ourselves to take back to our hotel.",Date of visit: June 2019,Esperides,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best restaurant in Sunny Beach,"The title says it all really.
This was our 2nd trip to Sunny Beach. Jupiter was our favourite last year so decided to go back. And it didn't disappoint. The food is amazing - we've ate there 5 times in total and the quality has been consistant.
The service is 1st class and the prices are brilliant.
Jupiter will be the first stop off for our 3rd trip to Sunny Beach next year.",Date of visit: August 2018,Jupiter Steak House,5,"Sunny Beach, Bulgaria"
Great value for money.,"We just got back on Sunday night after a week in Smolyan hotel. We booked room only as we like eating out. And we didn't use the pool as we prefer the beach.
I was very surprised to see some negative reviews on the hotel so I'm focusing mainly on the things people complained about.
The decor may have been a bit dated but the hotel is very clean. Towels changed daily, beds every other day.
Air con worked fine as did the tv and there was even a few English speaking channels.
We felt the hotel to be safe/secure and didn't rent a safe, mainly as we had Starling cards, but we did have some valuables lying around. They were as we left them.
I'd recommend Smolyan hotel and happily stay here again.",Date of stay: August 2018,Hotel Smolyan,5,"Smolyan, Bulgaria"
