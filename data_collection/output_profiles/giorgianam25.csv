The best,"Evert time I go to Kos I book for a fishing trip with Captain Tasos. It’s a really nice experience and the staff is very friendly. Once I caught an octopus, it felt so nice! You guys are awesome! If you go to Kos, you should try it! You will go for a second one, for sure! I went there 4 times! Sometimes they took photos which is great!",Date of experience: July 2019,Captain Tasos,5,"Kós, Greece"
