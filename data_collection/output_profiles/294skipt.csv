"A ""go to"" spot whenever I visit this town.","Whenever we are in town around supper time, Darby's is always on the top of the list on where to go to eat. The Pad Thai is some of the best i have ever had.",Date of visit: August 2019,Darby's,4,"Belfast, Maine"
Perfect Getaway!,"Spent a week here last summer. It was relaxing, hospitality was top notch, and the food was great! Set in the north Maine woods totally off the grid so don't bother with your cell phones or wifi. Your only job will be to relax, fish, hike, and canoe.",Date of stay: August 2019,Red River Camps,4,"Portage, Maine"
Move up to business class if you're over 5 feet tall!,"Great service, courteous staff, good food even but the seats were way to tight and very uncomfortable. Had to stand for much of the 10+ hour flight because with the seat back reclined in front of me I couldn't fit my knees in behind the seat. I'm 6 ft tall..not a giant by any means.",Date of travel: April 2019,Turkish Airlines,4,World
Wonderful way to spend a day on the Aegean Sea!,A great way to see the islands with your family. Fresh cooked seafood for lunch caught on your way out to your destination. It is a must for a first time visit to this island!,Date of experience: April 2019,Milos Fishing Experience,4,"Milos, Greece"
A must see in Athens! Pre-buy your tickets though.,It was an amazing sight! Standing on thousands of years of history. The only draw back was waiting in line for 1-1/2 hours to get an admission ticket. Seems the woman in the ticket booth was more interested in her cigarettes than selling passes to the sight. The booth was struck by lightning the next day so I better not say anything else....:),Date of experience: April 2019,Acropolis,4,"Athens, Greece"
Great place for a modern spin on traditional Greek fare.,"What can I say? Excellent food and service. Located upstairs in what seemed like an old family home, the atmosphere was welcoming. Great for a family or couples. I would suggest making a reservation as this is a very popular spot with the locals.",Date of visit: April 2019,Mani Mani,4,"Athens, Greece"
Great place to relax and enjoy a meal.,Nice place to sit outside and watch the marina boat traffic. The food is excellent! I suggest trying their traditional Greek Gyros. Not what I expected at all. A very pleasant surprise. Family friendly and the staff speak English very well.,Date of visit: April 2019,Flisvos,4,"Milos, Greece"
You Be Pleasantly Surprised :),Coming to find shelter and a drink from a hailstorm while visiting the Acropolis. We were welcomed with big smiles and great service. We decided to order some apps with our drinks and WOW what good food. They even gave us a complimentary dessert. I may fly back to Greece from the US just to go back for a full meal!,Date of visit: April 2019,Gods' Restaurant,4,"Athens, Greece"
