More first timers. Absolutely,"More first timers.
Absolutely lovely. Food and service faultless. We’ll definitely be coming back. Thank you to all the staff here.",Date of visit: January 2020,Rose Cafe & Greek Cuisine,1,"Isle of Sheppey, United Kingdom"
The best way to spend a hot afternoon.,"We had not been on a fishing trip before and Makarounas was recommended by the people I was Scuba diving with.
Both my wife and I absolutely loved it. Captain Vassilis and his mate where superb, nothing too much trouble and super helpful with fishing tips. With 12 on board we caught around 14 fish and had a blast in the process.
Then on to a little bay for snorkelling whilst Captain cooked (see what I done there).
The BBQ was the best, worthy of 5*s on its own. Beer was flowing, as with all drinks on board completely complementary and then a half hour or so trip back to the harbour admiring the views and relaxing.
Excuse the pic of the awesome food, Wife had placed her garlic bread on the fish",Date of experience: July 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Rocks and aeroplane’s,"Honestly, they need to do so much more. There’s nothing here at this end and I saw a sign a couple of hundred metres to the north saying end of blue flag award winning coast.",Date of experience: June 2019,Ialysos beach,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Lovely experience,"With hundreds of Greek restaurants locally we trusted Trip Advisor and found this genuine place that doesn’t try and grab you from the street.
The freshest fish, reasonably priced, great service in a piece of an old Rhodes town restaurant.
Highly recommend. You won’t be disappointed.",Date of visit: June 2019,Ouzokamomata Tapas,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Best Indian food we’ve had in Sittingbourne,"We’ve been here 5 times now and absolutely no complaints.
Food is nothing short of exquisite and the service is professional and honest.
Highly recommended. I wouldn’t bother eating elsewhere.",Date of visit: June 2019,Bengal Spice,1,"Sittingbourne, United Kingdom"
It'll be 3 visits in 3 days,"I'm in Worcester working and when you've stayed away on business as much as I have if its not broke, don't fix it.
There are too many places to count to eat out in Worcester, as luck would have it night #1 I ate here.
Beautiful bar, great staff and if you love pies and real ale this is the place, King Charles the 2nd seemed to like it here too. Choice of 12 pies no other food options but to be honest there's no need. Best pies I've had I think, already looking forward to tomorrow.
Dessert there's two options, Apple crumble with either custard or ice cream, as I've not had peas with either pie so far they let me have both.
If only every business trip was as this simple.",Date of visit: June 2016,King Charles II,1,"Worcester, United Kingdom"
Great Sushi and the best customer service,"Ok. So, I'm a Regional Manager for a Sushi company, that should tell you I know a little about Sushi. My Wife, dog and I have been here probably a dozen times. The quality of the food is great, I've recommended this place to all my friends and colleagues. Today being end of January it's pretty cold and they'd removed the two outside tables. I phoned from nearby to see if there was any chance we could sit outside as we have the dog with us but was politely explained that it is not possible. I wasn't giving up as cravings for a Hot Shiitaki mushroom roll and a carafe of hot sake were kicking in. So, I quickly popped in to see if the Manager was around and could see if he could be persuaded to move a table outside. Fortunately manager not around but Elena who recognised me immediately and said it was you on the phone and that we come with Scooby! She apologised as there is two servers on so couldn't really arrange an outside table but as we're regulars it's no problem. Come back in 15 mins and your table will be ready. All I can say is amazing. Sometimes it pays to frequent the same places and to be a nice customer! It really made our day.",Date of visit: January 2016,Feng Sushi,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Great place to eat in central Amsterdam,"I googled Thai restaurants near me and thankfully picked Thai Phutakun from the 20 choices. So glad I did, I went by myself 1st and have since been back twice with work colleagues. I love this place, food is awesome, zero negatives. Service is very friendly and welcoming the prices and portion sizes are better than great value. I'm in Amsterdam weekly and this is a highlight of my week.",Date of visit: July 2015,Thai Phutakun,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Great Restaurant in a Great location.,"I've always loved La Tasca and visited their new site on Saturday with a friend. Being in the City and right next door to the Lloyd's building it's probably rammed during the week but what a place to sit outside on the terrace on a Saturday evening under the cover of Leadenhall market.Our food, which we may have been a little over ordered as usual was faultless. We started with a fish course, Gambas, Calamari, Spanish Tortilla and Anchovies with bread (Ciabata with a tomato sauce topped with cured ham) and followed that several Meat plates and Bravas potatoes, told you we where hungry!. That's the beauty of Tapas compared with conventional 3 courses, why limit yourself to a starter and a main course when you can have five of each!
Service was great, especially as the terrace was a bit of a journey for our Waitress. I would definitely recommend this beautiful restaurant as a must try when in the City.",Date of visit: September 2014,La Tasca,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Table for 4 opposite the open plan Kitchen! The Chef's table:),"I love curry, really really love curry so When our friends invited us to Brick lane for one i was never going to say no. I'd seen on Twitter that the Lahore Kebab house comes highly recommended so when this was suggested i said absolutely.
I didn't know what to expect and on seeing my friends rucksack full of Wine it soon became apparant that it's a take your own which I've never done. Just in case there's an Off licence right next door which must make a fortune with it's competitively priced big bottles of Cobra so there is no need to worry about drinks.
Lahore kebab house is massive, can probably seat around 400 on two floors which they did and maybe several seatings. The food is inexpensive but don't let that put you off. We as usual over ordered but so glad we did. The best Onion Bhaji's you will ever taste, Lamb chops that you will probably order more because they are so good and Naan breads to die for. The Curry menu is small but quality is great and you can have them as spiced as you like.
Service is fun, I don't think you would be able to figure out just how many serving staff there are but it's very well organised and you don't wait long for anything.
Our Table was opposite the open plan kitchen, a great place to sit and watch the going's on in the kitchen.
We will be going again this weekend, i hope they'll give us the same table even though it'll be for two instead of four.",Date of visit: September 2014,Lahore Kebab House,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Best Beach dining in Versilia,"Visiting relatives in Tuscany and came to Bagno Malu for lunch in the sun. Only intended on one glass of wine but Bruno the owner recommended the cheapest wine on the list, so good, 3 euros, we had six! Food, well, the nicest, freshest tuna salad, cooked medium and served with local tomatoes. Amazing. If your lucky enough to be in the area I can't recommend this lovely place enough.",Date of visit: July 2013,Bagno Malù,1,"Poveromo, Italy"
Amazing oasis in the city!,"Amazing! After 12 years of working in london I've been lucky enough to be relocated near the gherkin. And lucky enough to have The Sterling right there! Can't recommend this place enough, sun's out and had been dreaming of this all morning. It was soooo busy but the staff are that good that you really didn't realise. Thank you all and I'll see you next week.",Date of visit: May 2013,The Sterling,1,"London, United Kingdom"
South east london can compete with the best.,My review cannot do justice to the amazing meal we've just had here. A steak that can only be the best I've ever had with a gorgeous Sardinian Cannonau. Equally the service cannot be faulted and I've wined and dined at some of the best restaurants in the world. You need to try this place.,Date of visit: April 2013,Le Querce,1,"London, United Kingdom"
