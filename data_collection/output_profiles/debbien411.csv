Nice clean resort - great beach - great staff,"My husband and I stayed at Ocean Casa Del Mar Feb 2-11. Our room (1148) was nice and clean, with large waterfall shower! The grounds are relatively new and not mature yet, and there is significant land between the buildings and the sea that still needs to be developed. However that did not bother us at all. The sea was fantastic, clean waters, shallow enough to walk in easily. However most days were windy and wavy, and there are some sections where there is a slight drop when you go into the water, so need to be careful. The staff were great, we had problem with our door key stopped working pretty much every day. They were very attentive to try & fix the problem each time. The housekeeping and dining staff were wonderful! Special Thank You! to Yadaily and Ernesto in the buffet! We liked the Neptune restaurant, the food there was pretty good. The buffet food was to Cuban standards, the omelet was good in the morning. No complaints there either. Tfhe only recommendation I would make is to put No Smoking signs up in the outside eating areas of the buffet. If you want to sit outside to have your meal, you could have people smoking all around you. So oftentimes we had to eat inside to avoid inhaling the cigar & cigarette smoke.",Date of stay: February 2018,Casa del Mar,4,Cuba
"Excellent tour of Toronto, including two very distinct neighbourhoods","Went on a wonderful walking tour today to learn a little more about the city I grew up in and live in.

Our very passionate and energetic tourguide, Ellie, took us on a journey starting at Union Station (a Toronto landmark where thousands of people travel through each day!). During the tour we learned all sorts of interesting facts relating to Drake. Not knowing much about Drake, I was totally impressed about the great love he has for this wonderful city!

We visited several Toronto landmarks learning some very interesting facts along the way. Then we visited two very distinct and very cool neighbourhoods (just blocks apart) and Ellie took us through the culture, landscape, community, and uniqueness of each. Ellie's passion, her energy, and love for Toronto is very evident and makes the tour a great and entertaining experience.

Whether you're a Drake fan or not, whether you're from the GTA or the other side of the world, this is a not-to-miss tour. A great way to spend a morning in TO!!",Date of experience: October 2017,Tours of the 6,4,"Toronto, Canada"
A great experience and great day!,"Thank you Antonia and family for the wonderful day! My husband and I, along with my brother-in-law who was in crutches due to a broken leg, as well as his family went on the excursion in late August. Antonia and family were very helpful to ensure my brother-in-law was comfortable the entire trip. What a great experience for my two nephews (and all of us) to watch as Mustafa brought in the 2km of nets and watch the fish accumulate as the nets were brought in. Then, while we went out for a wonderful swim at this beautiful cove, Antonia, Michalis, and Mustafa cooked a wonderful meal for us, including Greek salad, potato salad, and a variety of bbq and fried fish! Delicious!! It was a fantastic day and a trip well worth taking. We all learned a few things about fishing and about Kefalonia!",Date of experience: August 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Amazing beach in a beautiful cove,"Ai Helis is a wonderful sandy beach in a beautiful cove. Access is by stairs (85 of them) but well worth the treck. Half the beach is managed (umbrellas, etc...) and the other half you can put your own towels and umbrellas down on the sand. Shallow waters are ideal for families as well.",Date of experience: August 2017,Ai Helis Beach,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Assos, Kefalonia",Very picturesque area with small beaches (with stones) and places to stop and catch a bite. Was not impressed with the food quality and prices.,Date of experience: August 2017,Assos,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Myrtos Beach, Kefalonia, Greece","Very beautiful beach, one of the prettiest I've seen. It is fabulous to see but is rocky and there is a dangerous undertow. For swimming there are other much more suitable (and beautiful) beaches in Kefalonia.",Date of experience: August 2017,Myrtos Beach,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Melissani Cave and Lake,"Great excursion, inexpensive and you get to go on a boat ride on the lake inside the cave. Our host provided us with details about the cave and lake and was very entertaining. Great for both families and couples. A must see in Kefalonia.",Date of experience: August 2017,Melissani Cave,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Drogarati Cave,"Very nice cave, lots to see while inside. Very reasonably priced. You walk through the entire cave and there are steps to get into the cave and within the cave. Some areas can be slippery so walk with caution. Could also use better lighting in some areas. Overall a great experience. A must see while in Kefalonia.",Date of experience: August 2017,Drogarati Cave,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Port of Sami,"We visited the port of Sami when arriving and leaving the island via ferry. The port town is very nice and we found a small taverna where we purchased various pitas and had some fredo espresso. Very nice town to walk around, shop, and eat.",Date of experience: August 2017,Port of Sami,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Xi Beach, Kefalonia",Amazing beach with red/brown sand and clear shallow sandy waters! There is also clay from the stone surroundings that you can put all over your body for soft and beautiful skin! You would pay a fortune at the spa for that treatment. The beach is ideal for families and couples We loved this beach!!,Date of experience: August 2017,Xi Beach,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Alexandrina Hotel,"We stayed at Alexandrina Hotel Aug 12-16. It was a wonderful stay. This complex is owned and operated by a wonderful family who truly cares and ensures you have a great and memorable stay. Our room was very comfortable and clean, with good quality comfortable mattress. The food was outstanding, traditional Greek cuisine, all cooked onsite by Alexandra. The family uses only the finest ingredients in all their food, using top quality olive oil that they make themselves.People go there for dinner even if they're not staying there. Locals would come to enjoy a great dinner. My favourite - the stifado! Top quality just like my mom used to make. The resort is suitable for couples and families. The beach is just past the driveway across the street. We had a very peaceful and relaxing stay here and would definitely return when we get a chance to visit Greece again.",Date of stay: August 2017,Alexandrina,4,"Kassandrino, Greece"
"Esperides restaurant, Svoronata",We ate at Esperides restaurant twice during our stay in Kefalonia this past August. Both times the food and the service was excellent. Esperides restaurant is located in a wonderful picturesque setting amidst orange groves. We ate at various restaurants in Kefalonia during our stay but returned to Esperides as it was the best restaurant of all the ones we tried. Their food was of great quality and taste. You have to try their Orange cake!,Date of visit: August 2017,Esperides,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Ammes Beach,"Wonderful sand beach with sunbeds and umbrellas available as well as food/drinks. Right next to the airport, you can see the planes flying in, right above you - quite cool!",Date of experience: August 2017,Ammes Beach,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Milos Restaurant,"Restaurant is nicely situated across from the water, great sunset views and Greek music makes for a nice atmosphere. Food was quite dissapointing though, even the desserts.",Date of visit: August 2017,O Milos,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Avithos Resort,"Avithos was a good resort, ideal for families, there was a very nice clean pool, the rooms were spacious and clean, with well stocked kitchenettes. The grounds are well kept and nicely landscaped. The staff were very accommodating and friendly. We were away at the beach most of the day and used the resort only overnight. Did not use the pool and other facilities.",Date of stay: August 2017,Avithos Resort Hotel,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
