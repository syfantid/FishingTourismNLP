Perfect day at sea,"Had a fantastic day....4 trips in one.
1.Took us around the harbour by sea.
2.2to 2.5 hours fishing
3. Went close to beach so those that wanted to swim could. While... 4. Good bbq was prepared.
The fish we hooked was added to the bbq and served with a salad.
Well worth the money, we would highly recommend.",Date of experience: October 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"

Spa treatment and personal high recommended

Sight Seeing Long Weekend,"Booked a 2 bedroom apartment, we could not have chosen a better hotel for 2 couples travelling together, it was perfect for our party, with a large living area and kitchen, allowed us to finish the evening with a night cap and chat, and to start the day with a coffee and discussion on where to head off to in comfort.
Breakfast self-service but waitress/chef would cook fresh ham & eggs, boiled, scrambled etc.
Staff were cheerful and very helpful
We found this hotel extremely good value for money and would highly recommend it.",Date of stay: March 2017,City Hotel Budapest Tarsashaz,4,"Budapest, Hungary"
Relaxing Stay at Sol Calas De Mallorca,"Can not fault hotel, friendly staff, good food, clean rooms etc. would highly recommend it.
About 5-10mins to nearest beach with a steep slope/steeps down, (looking down from the top, very shallow and calm sea, and beach sandy & clean)
There is another beach about 15mins in the other direction which walking the coast road would keep you on 'the flat'
About a 10-15 min walk to main resort centre, uphill, only for this reason alone I would not go back to this resort",Date of stay: October 2016,Sol Calas de Mallorca,4,"Majorca, Spain"
1st class B&B better than a 4 star + hotel,"Absolutely lovely B&B, very welcoming, clean, comfortable, would highly recommend to anyone.
Large choice of breakfast we had full Irish both mornings, and was perfect, could also have cereals, fruit, toast or continental.
Best nights sleep in ages, very comfortable bed.
owners very friendly, and helpful, rooms are quiet, and warm with radiators and I think underfloor heating",Date of stay: February 2015,Portobello Bed and Breakfast,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
