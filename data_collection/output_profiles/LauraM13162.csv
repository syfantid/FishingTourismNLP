Fantastic authentic greek boat trip,"Family of three enjoyed the day on Michalis enjoying sun, sea food and splashing around in the sea. The food was great and can't fault all of our hosts including their encouragement when our young lad was reluctant to jump from the boat....he was so pleased with himself when he did. Thanks again to you all we had a fantastic time.",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
