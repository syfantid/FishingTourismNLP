Great food and Service,Stopped for lunch whilst in Bridgeport. Food was excellent and reasonably priced. Highly recommend it.,Date of visit: July 2019,Mr. Crab Seafood & Bar,1,"Bridgeport, Connecticut"
No longer the best Hotel in Doha,"I have stayed at this hotel for years now and it was easily the best in Doha however, I have noticed that the hotel itself is starting to look worn and the service levels have dropped significantly from their previous lofty levels!

At check in i was told that the room i had booked was not available due to over booking. They did say that i could switch the next day but i really didn't want to pack all my stuff and change rooms.

Everything now seems to take longer. Getting through to room service took 10 mins on one occasion and then it took 40 mins to arrive (they tell you it will be 30 mins max).

On another occasion I couldn't get onto the internet and again 2 hours later someone called me back to help.

This all makes a bit of a joke of the ""Whatever Whenever"" mantra!

I also had a slow draining sink but to be honest i really couldn't be bothered to call it in and wait for someone to come and fix it.",Date of stay: November 2018,W Doha,1,"Doha, Qatar"
Fantastic Experience!,"I can’t recommend these guys enough! We (2 adults and 2 kids 9y and 11y) went on the Sostis with Captain Stergos. He’s brilliant, patient and great with kids. We had a lovely time and caught lots of fish. Had to throw back a fair few small ones but you can eat the big ones and they will arrange them to be cooked for you after the trip. Thanks!!",Date of experience: August 2018,Sostis & Saratonga Faliraki Fishing Trips,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Fab little hotel.,Stayed here for one night for business. Great location right in the heart of everything with lots of restaurants around. Rooms are very clean and the attached restaurant serves great food. I have to especially mention the service which is 5 star! The staff are excellent - Paolo (reception) in particular who couldn’t do enough to help. Thanks!,Date of stay: January 2018,Hotel Vauban,1,"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg"
Saturday Lunch,"Don't be put off if the restaurant is empty when you go in - I think we came at its quietest time but wow what amazing food and service!

Kids menu was excellent - generous size for my 7 and 9 year old boys who both eat like adults!

Pie and Pork belly were delicious and the desserts nearly killed us because we had to eat all of it - it was so good.",Date of visit: January 2017,The Royal Oak,1,"Grantham, United Kingdom"
Terrible Experience,We booked here for our team Christmas Lunch. The experience was bad from start to finish. Initially the service was poor - slow and unfriendly. The table hadn't been cleaned properly either. The food was below average at best - Starters OK but Turkey was dry and tasteless. Wouldn't rush back.,Date of visit: December 2016,Browns Brasserie & Bar - West India Quay,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Best food we had in Rome!,Just wondered in here with no expectations. Modern looking restaurant with tremendous food and really great service. Thanks for a memorable meal and evening guys!,Date of visit: August 2016,Volare,1,"Rome, Italy"
Not the cheapest but definitely the best food so far,Truly excellent food. The gnocchi and porchetta on bread was delicious and the service was good. Nice quiet street and good shade.,Date of visit: August 2016,Brillo Restaurant,1,"Rome, Italy"
Lots of bad reviews on Trip Advisor but we enjoyed it!,Easy option for us as it was very close to our apartment. Sat down and then read the reviews on TripAdvisor so wasn't expecting much. Service really needs to get better but don't be put off by the poor reviews - the street has great atmosphere and the food is really good.,Date of visit: August 2016,Binario 4,1,"Rome, Italy"
Good Food and Lovely Atmosphere,"Very nice venue close to the Colosseum. The inside is done out traditionally and once the restaurant fills up, the atmosphere is great. Can't really fault the food.",Date of visit: August 2016,Osteria Angelino dal 1899,1,"Rome, Italy"
OK,Lots of people raved about this place so we tried it and I put this review down to bad luck perhaps...we thought the ambience was ok but we were right in a corner which didn't help. Service was slow and we have been spoilt on this holiday so our expectations were high. Food was ok. Frogs legs were great and the pork and aubergines too were excellent however the beef lok lak and chicken amok were very bland.,,Mie Cafe,1,"Siem Reap, Cambodia"
Good food but slightly under par service,"The Olive was recommended by a local expat and the food was undoubtedly excellent. Only criticism was the service which given the restaurant was empty when we got there, was a bit slow and non-attentive.",,Olive Cuisine de Saison,1,"Siem Reap, Cambodia"
Delightful Shop!,This place is fab - really unusual stuff for sale and things you won't find elsewhere. The owner is lovely - really friendly and also has some great local knowledge which he will happily share. Thanks Doug!,,Trunkh,1,"Siem Reap, Cambodia"
Best Service so far and great food!,Having tried to book at a number of places with no luck we finally got a table at L'Annexe. The food was excellent and the service was very warm and exceptional. They have a (small) kids menu but my two boys shared a steak and loved it. Dessert was amazing. Prices are expensive for Siem Reap but it's still very reasonable - 2 course dinner for the four of us with a good bottle of wine and cocktails came to $130. They don't take card but there is an ATM just across the road.,,L'Annexe French Restaurant,1,"Siem Reap, Cambodia"
Best Food so far!,Wow what great food they serve here! It's down a dark residential street but well worth a visit for the amazing food! Grilled Skewers and Eggplant with Pork were unexpectedly the tastiest things we have eaten so far on holiday.,,The Touich Restaurant Bar,1,"Siem Reap, Cambodia"
WOW!,Simply - the best ice cream I have ever had! Only regret is not going here sooner - looking forward to tonight's visit! Pistachio was great but my favourite is the Amaretto!,,Gelato and Coffee Lab,1,"Siem Reap, Cambodia"
Great for families,"Stayed one night with the family. Nice, clean hotel. Staff were very helpful. We stayed in a queen room and our two boys (7 and 5) shared one bed and we slept in the other. Plenty of room but it was a little nosiy.

Arabesque (buffet) Restaurant was great - food in particular was excellent.

Would definitely stay here again if I was visiting Al Ain.",Date of stay: January 2015,Danat Al Ain Resort,1,"Al Ain, United Arab Emirates"
