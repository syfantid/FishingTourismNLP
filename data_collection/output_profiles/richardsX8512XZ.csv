DO NOT USE THIS CAMPSITE!!!!!,"Stayed here prior to Octoberfest.
A few days before the Fest kicked off they made us move (even though we had asked repeatedly if they needed that site) it was pissing with rain and the owner said 'you have two hours to move or I will kick you out'.
The price went from €32 to €42, all drinks went up 30%, all toilet rolls were removed from washrooms and dishwashing facilities shut down.
These people are greedy and arrogant. Do not give then your business.",Date of stay: September 2017,Campingplatz Thalkirchen,1,"Munich, Germany"
Not to be missed!!!!,"Just back in from a brilliant day out with Captain Dimitrios, Chef Efi & 1st Mate Mohammed.
From the onset we were made welcome and certainly felt at home.
Nothing too much trouble from this unique and very enjoyable venture, it might be a working boat but today we were the stars, seafood does not get any better and Efi knows how to present an excellent selection fresh out of the water, all accompanied with organic veg and salads from their garden, did I mention the wine and ouzo? or the homemade olive oil, vinaigrette, local salt the list goes on, extremely enjoyable and certainly a pleasure to be a part of.
Don't change anything guys, this is pure gold.
Most certainly a day to remember, any time your in Oz it's our shout.
