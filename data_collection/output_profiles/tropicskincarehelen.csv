Amazing day with Efi and Dimitri!,"Just had the most fantastic day with Efi and Dimitrios! Both of you were so friendly and hospitable and have is a day to remember. We sadly missed this trip last time we visited Kefalonia and booked in advance to ensure we got to go for this visit.
This trip is an absolute must for anyone that wants to experience something different where you can be hands on as you like or just sit back.
We took our two children who loved to see all the difference types of fish and help pull the nets in. The crew had fantastic knowledge of all the fish. Efthi is an amazing cook and managed to knock up a banquet of most the fish from the catch today along with beautiful homegrown produce and own wine. I’ve never tried so many different types of fish in one meal.
We also had opportunities to jump off at two lovely beaches accessible by boat only and try the local clay as a mask on our bodies whilst on one beach. Everything was planned to give a perfect day. My son who loves fishing wants to go again this week if possible it’s a shame we aren’t stopping closer to Katelios. We all loved today so thanks so much for everything and we will definitely be back again and wouldn’t hesitate in recommending this trip to anyone.
I have been visiting Kefalonia for 30 years with my family and and always look for new places to visit. This was one of the best and we will definitely book again. I’ve met many people from Kefalonia over the years and just love the friendliness of locals, Efi and Dimitri who clearly are passionate about fishing and are such lovely people who certainly make this trip special.",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
