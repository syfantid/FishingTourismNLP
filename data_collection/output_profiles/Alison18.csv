recommended,The benefit of visiting Venice during the pandemic was the minimal queues for attractions. We waited less than 10 minutes for the elevator ride to the top and there were limited numbers of people admiring the views. As expected the views are stunning and the 10 euro entrance fee wasn't unreasonable.,Date of experience: September 2020,Campanile di San Marco,1,"Venice, Italy"
Highly recommended,We spent 4 nights at the Saturnia and would return in a heartbeat. The location in unbeatable and every member of staff we came into contact with was helpful and courteous. The courtyard location for breakfast was a great way to start the day and the roof top terrace a great place to return to before heading out for the evening.,Date of stay: September 2020,Hotel Saturnia & International,1,"Venice, Italy"
Great night out,We visited as a group of 7 and had a fantastic evening. Six of us chose the fillet steak or chateau briand and the other had chicken cordon bleu. Portions were generous and the meat cooked beautifully. The customer service is unbeatable with friendly staff who enjoy a laugh and a joke. We’ll be back!!,Date of visit: February 2020,Restaurante Camel,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Highly recommended!,We ate here as a group of five last night and really enjoyed ourselves. Four of us opted for the set menu which is great value at €14.95. One of our group chose a chicken dhansak which wasn’t part of the set menu but the waitress offered to include it as part of the deal. The food was tasty with generous portion sizes. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended!,Date of visit: February 2020,Flavours,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Impressive,We rode around the park on our motorbike having watched the video in the visitors centre first. The Union and Confederate lines are clearly identified with helpful signage. The highlights for us were the USS Cairo and visitors centre and the cemetery - very poignant.,Date of experience: May 2019,Vicksburg National Military Park,1,"Vicksburg, Mississippi"
Avoid,"we were booked as part of a group and were apprehensive as we had read the reviews before we travelled however were reassured by our tour leader that there had been several conversations with the manager and we would be allocated refurbished rooms. This wasn't the case. Check in was chaotic and the rooms were awful - cigarette holes on the bedcover, cockroaches in the bathroom, curtain hems held up by paper clips, beds that looked as if they' d been slept in and no towels. The member of staff on reception didn't have access to the cupboard where the towels were stored. We voted with our feet and didn't stay and moved to another hotel.",Date of stay: May 2019,Days Inn & Suites by Wyndham Vicksburg,1,"Vicksburg, Mississippi"
Worth visiting,"We spent a lovely day in Assos. The road down is fairly narrow and winding but we didn't encounter much traffic coming in the other direction so it was fine. As other reviews have said, parking isn't easy so it's worth parking as soon as you see a space as the two parking areas in the centre get filled very quickly. The walk up to the top of the old Venetian fort gives stunning views over the town. The wide paved path is 400m longer than the other path that is signposted but is easier to walk on. Take water with you!",Date of experience: September 2019,Assos,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
delicious food in a beautiful setting,we ate here twice whilst staying nearby. Staff are attentive and the setting is beautiful with a touch of luxury. The views at sunset are stunning. Food is delicious - I had the pork and green peppers on the first visit and the souvlaki on the second.,Date of visit: September 2019,AMMES taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
A must for cheesecake fans!,We were recommended to try Kastro by two other couples we met on holiday. The specials menu had a list of mouthwatering cheesecakes and we opted for the Black Forest cheesecake on the recommendation of others. It was delicious! The setting is beautiful and staff very friendly. We'd happily return for a meal.,Date of visit: September 2019,Kastro Cafe,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Our favourite day of our holiday,"We had a fantastic day with Antonia and Michalis on board their working fishing boat. We met at 8am and were welcomed with Greek coffee and cake and a chance to chat to the other members of the group. Two couples had taken the trip previously which was a good sign. Having set sail we then watched the 2km of nets being brought in with the opportunity to help if you wanted to. There was a great mixture of fish including red mullet, German fish, scorpion fish, cuttle fish and a slipper lobster. We sailed to a cove only accessible by boat and swam in the clear waters whilst Antonia prepared lunch. A Greek bruschetta laden with fresh vegetables was a tasty appetiser whilst we waited for the main course of seafood spaghetti, a huge platter of the fish caught earlier on and huge bowls of salad all washed down with the family's own wine. Antonia Kindly filleted the fish for those of us who were slightly squeamish about eyes and bones! A platter of fresh fruit finished off the meal before we filed back to the marina at 4pm. At 60 euros per person the day represented great value. We'd book again if we return to Kefalonia.
Thank you!",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Slightly disappointed,I might have been suffering from music museum fatigue but this just didn’t grab me. Introductory film was informative but the remainder of the museum was disappointing.,Date of experience: July 2019,Stax Museum of American Soul Music,1,"Memphis, Tennessee"
Well worth a visit,Thought provoking museum with lots of information. Highlight was the view of the hotel room and balcony where MLK was assassinated.,Date of experience: July 2019,National Civil Rights Museum - Lorraine Motel,1,"Memphis, Tennessee"
Fascinating,Really interesting tour around the surprisingly small studios. Knowledgeable and enthusiastic guide with great soundbites of songs recorded in the studio. Tickets give you free ride on the shuttle bus to Graceland too.,,Sun Studio Admission Ticket with Guided Tour,1,"Memphis, Tennessee"
quirky place for BBQ food,We were recommended to eat here and weren't disappointed by the food. It's a no-frills environment but service was friendly and food was tasty.,Date of visit: May 2019,Barrel House BBQ,1,"Lynchburg, Tennessee"
Highly recommended - even if you don't like whisky!,"Fascinating tour around the distillery. Our guide was passionate and a great communicator. I'm not a whisky drinker but really appreciated the insight into the history of the distillery, Jack Daniels himself and the process of making whisky. My only complaint would be that the group size was quite large so it was sometimes difficult to keep together and hear everything that was being said.",Date of experience: May 2019,Jack Daniel's Distillery,1,"Lynchburg, Tennessee"
twice in a week!,Came here after work with colleagues and enjoyed it so much that I came back with husband last night. Food is fresh and tasty sand well priced for central London. Can recommend the Summer Rolls (we had the hoisin duck) and the lime leaf chicken and tiger prawn vermicelli salads (£8.50/9). Food arrives very quickly so it's not a place I'd recommend for a long evening out but will certainly go back. o our second visit we received the bill before we were even asked if we'd like anything else; the restaurant was empty as we we ate at 6.30pm so I was slightly surprised. We'd have probably stayed for another beer if we'd been asked!,Date of visit: June 2019,Bang Bang Vietnamese Canteen,1,"London, United Kingdom"
After work meal,Hadn’t intended to eat here but our usual places were full due to the filming of BGT at the Apollo! So pleased we did as we had a great time. Food tasty and lovely cocktails. Manager was attentive and chatty. Would return!,Date of visit: June 2019,Kindred,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Fantastic Italian cooking class,"This was a Christmas present from my son and I can’t think of a better present! My husband and I had a great evening starting with the Aperol Spritz when we walked in. Staff:student numbers were high so there was a lot of support available and people to top up wine glasses! We cooked delicious food in a fun, friendly and relaxing environment. I’ll be dropping hints for my birthday!!",Date of experience: May 2019,The Avenue Cookery School,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Great people watching,We enjoyed wandering down Beale Street listening to snatches of music from the bars and watching street performers. A fun vibe!,Date of experience: May 2019,Beale Street,1,"Memphis, Tennessee"
Good food,"Ate here twice during a brief visit to Memphis. Setting is fairly basic but we all enjoyed our food on both occasions. Between us we had gumbo, shrimps, steak, stuffed mushrooms and ribs. Generous portions and staff were friendly. We talked to some locals in the queue and they said it was the best place to eat on Beale Street. Shame about the plastic glasses but only a minor gripe!",Date of visit: May 2019,Blues City Cafe,1,"Memphis, Tennessee"
Great meal and music,A group of about 25 had dinner here at the start of our motorbike trip. We had a set menu to choose from but everything was delicious. Staff were friendly.,Date of visit: May 2019,B.B. King's Blues Club,1,"Nashville, Tennessee"
Good location,Stayed for 3 nights at the beginning of our motorcycle trip around the Deep South. Rooms were comfy although a little dark. All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful. Good range of food and drinks at breakfast.,Date of stay: May 2019,The Capitol Hotel Downtown Nashville,1,"Nashville, Tennessee"
Great meal,"A group of about 20 made an unplanned visit for dinner as we were staying nearby, food was great and plentiful and the waitress coped really well with the sudden influx of diners. H can highly recommend the margaritas which were a bargain at $2. My chicken was really tender and moist too.",Date of visit: May 2019,Old Town Grill,1,"Somerset, Kentucky"
Botanical based cocktails,"Popped in for a couple of drinks after work. Small and select choice of unusual cocktails, table service by attentive staff who also regularly topped up glasses of water.",Date of visit: April 2019,Mr. Fogg's House of Botanicals,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Great night out,We had a lovely meal here as part of a special event with the London Philharmonia playing in the middle of the restaurant. Food from the set menu was tasty with attentive service.,Date of visit: February 2019,Brasserie Zedel,1,"London, United Kingdom"
recent refurbishment,Bill's has a wide-ranging menu to suit all tastes and appetites. Staff are friendly and there was no pressure to vacate our table. The recent refurbishment is lovely.,Date of visit: January 2019,Bill's Hammersmith,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Highly recommended,received a recommendation from a friend part-way through our holiday but the website didn't have any tours available before we left so I sent a message and received a quick response saying that they would be happy to arrange a tour for the 5 of us. I'm so glad we had the opportunity. We were collected in a mini-bus by Dan who was really informative. We learnt lots about wine growing on Lanzarote and got to tase some great wine.,Date of experience: January 2019,Wine Tours Lanzarote,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Great food,huge choice of food including tapas and steaks. The steaks were generously sized. Good choice of wine available and choice of liquor free of charge after our meal.,Date of visit: January 2019,Restaurante Camel,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
lovely tapas,stopped here for a late lunch on our way back from the North of the island. Staff were very friendly and we enjoyed a leisurely lunch in the square. The garlic prawns and fried goats cheese with marmalade were lovely.,Date of visit: January 2019,El Rincon de Quino,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Great views,Definitely worth buying the multi-centre discount tickets. The views on the way here are spectacular as are the views from the top once you're inside. We had coffee overlooking Graciosa and enjoyed taking our time to soak up the panoramic views.,Date of experience: January 2019,Mirador Del Rio,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Excellent tour,Enjoyable guided tour with guide who spoke good English. You need to be able to crouch down at times so it's not good for people with mobility difficulties. No cafe facilities so make sure you grab a drink beforehand.,Date of experience: January 2019,Cueva de los Verdes,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
stunning,We really enjoyed our wander around the cacti. Beautifully maintained with a huge variety. Well worth buying the multi-entrance tickets for all the Manrique attractions.,Date of experience: January 2019,Jardin de Cactus,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Great views,We enjoyed a jug of Sangria whilst sitting outside and watching the sunset. Great views and friendly staff.,Date of visit: January 2019,El Mirador,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Sangria and Sunset,we went down to the marina and found a great place to watch the sunset whilst enjoying a glass of sunset. Lots of shops and places to eat although we didn't look at the shops.,Date of experience: January 2019,Marina Rubicon,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
amazing,Definitely worth a visit. Good value when bought as part of the CACT Lanzarote pass. Worth downloading the app as well as there's additional detail than you receive via the recorded commentary on the tour bus.,Date of experience: January 2019,Montaña Roja,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
great location and food,Had a really enjoyable evening here. Tapas was great and staff were friendly. Wide range of dishes on offer. We ate inside as it was a bit chilly but the outdoor seating are has great views of the marina. We had 10 dishes plus a couple of potatoes dishes and bread and wine for about 90 euros,Date of visit: January 2019,Mesón La Taberna,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Attentive service,Had a lovely meal here. Good choice of food and generous portions. Complimentary caramel vodka to finish!,Date of visit: January 2019,Sebastyan's Greek Gourmet,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Short but sweet,We visited just before midday so the water was particularly blue. We didn't have to queue for long so the fact that the boat trip was fairly short was ok. At 7 euros it was reasonably priced.,Date of experience: September 2018,Melissani Cave,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely views,we ate here at sunset so enjoyed the stunning view. We strarted with olives and tzatziki and then had moussaka and stuffed peppers - delicious. With 2 small draft beers and a large bottle of water the bill came to approx 32 euros. the complimentary yoghurt and honey was lovely.,Date of visit: September 2018,Koutoupas Paradise,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
We loved it!,We had a fantastic morning at Dias Apiary and can't recommend it highly enough. We were welcomed with coffee and water and an introductory talk about the bees and the hives before donning our protective suits and visiting the hives and then seeing the honey extracted.The level of detail was appropriate to the group and all our questions were answered. We finished off the morning by making beeswax candles and eating lovely snacks washed down with homemade wine. It was excellent value for money (16 euros). We're now back from Kefalonia but I had Dias honey on my toast this morning - delicious!,Date of experience: September 2018,Dias Beekeeping,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
great service,the friendly service alone made it worth the long and dark walk from our accommodation. Good choice of food too. We shared a greek salad to start and had souvlaki and meatballs washed down with 1 litre of house wine and a large bottle of water for approx 40 euros. The complimentary chocolate cake was delicious. Only the distance put us off going back!,Date of visit: September 2018,Dum Spiros Spero Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Good food although slightly haphazard service,"we ate here twice during our recent trip and really enjoyed ourselves. The setting is lovely with great views. food is tasty although slightly more expensive than other similar local restaurants. We had tsatziki, pork and chicken gyros, half a litre of house wine and a large water for approx 30 euros. There is only one waitress who is lovely but there are long waits for service to the extent that we saw two couples leave having waited for 30 minutes without their order being taken. Don't let that put you off as it's worth a visit.",Date of visit: September 2018,La Tavolata,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
interesting,"We thought the monastery was closed and almost went away but the monastery is separate from the main, large church (pictured). It's accessed through a gate on the left at the rear of the church grounds or directly from a smaller road. The monastery is built over a cave which can be accessed via a ladder within the church although is just a small cave. The mummified body of St Gerasimos is in an ornate coffin. Our visit coincided with the priest opening the 'tomb' enabling worshippers to kiss the body. If you're in the area it's worth seeing but I'm not sure I would go out of my way to visit.",Date of experience: September 2018,Monastery of Agios Gerasimos,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Heavenly!,"We ate here following the reviews on trip Advisor and weren't disappointed. The setting, food and service were all outstanding. The pork and orange, lamb chops and orange cake are all highly recommended.",Date of visit: September 2018,Esperides,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely local beach,We stayed about 300m from Ammes Beach so were frequent visitors during our trip to Kefalonia. Sunbeds are available from three different proprietors - the two main ones charge 7 euros for two beds and an umbrella and on the far left there are beds available for 5 euros for customers of Tropicana bar/cafe on the main road. The beach is under the flight path but this was a source of entertainment rather than a nuisance. Parking available on the main road. No loos on the beach but there are showers at either end.,Date of experience: September 2018,Ammes Beach,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
A little piece of Paradise!,"We've just returned from a 12 night stay at Baha Ammes. We booked on the basis of the reviews on Trip Advisor and weren't disappointed. The gardens are truly magnificent and had something new to show every day. George and his wife were delightful and very helpful. George booked our car hire for us. We booked a 2 bed apartment as we wanted to have our own veranda and spent many hours playing cards and drinking the local beer and wine! The apartments are immaculately clean and towels/linen were changed frequently. The kitchen was sufficiently well-equipped for us to cook dinner on 3 nights when we'd been sightseeing and didn't fancy the effort of going out!
We'll be back!",Date of stay: September 2018,Baha Ammes Apartments,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Good choice of food,"Popped in for afternoon tea but there was plenty of other food on offer including soup, sandwiches, jacket potatoes, omelettes and a range of specials. Service wasn't the greatest but it was ok.",Date of visit: August 2018,Elizabeths tea and coffee shop,1,"Swanage, United Kingdom"
COMBINED RAILWAY AND MODEL VILLAGE TICKET,had a lovely time on the seam train from Swanage to Corfe. We bought the combined railway / model village ticket which represents good value. The rail ticket also gets you 10% discount in the Greyhound Pub in Corfe.,Date of experience: August 2018,Swanage Railway,1,"Swanage, United Kingdom"
delicious,there are lots of places to buy ice cream in Swanage but Giggis gets my vote. Good choice of flavours - i can recommend the salted caramel and cookies and cream.,Date of visit: August 2018,GIGGI ICE CREAM KIOSK,1,"Swanage, United Kingdom"
Excellent,My son had recommended El Toro having eaten there a couple of times recently so we ate there last night to celebrate his birthday. We ordered about 9 dishes from the main and specials menu and each and every one was delicious. The waitress was attentive and friendly. We’ll definitely be back!!,Date of visit: July 2018,"El Toro, Tapas Bar & Restaurant",1,"New Malden, United Kingdom"
Fish and chips,Had a takeaway from here as our usual chip shop was closed. Food was hot and portions generous although more pricey than our regular place.,Date of visit: July 2018,Salt & Vinegar?,1,"New Malden, United Kingdom"
Delicious food,We had a takeaway from and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. There was a mixup with our order so we waited longer than the advised 40 minutes for delivery but the food was plentiful and delicious.,Date of visit: June 2018,Tanoor Persian Cuisine,1,"Worcester Park, United Kingdom"
Not sure I’d rush back,Had lunch with a friend and we both chose the same dish from the lunch offer menu. Our order was taken by the manager on duty and unfortunately we were served the wrong dish so had to wait for a while for the correct one to be cooked. We were offered a free drink when we eventually got our meal which was a nice gesture but it would have been better if the offer had been made when the incorrect meal was served. The food was ok but nothing special. Whilst the set lunch menu was good value I’m not sure I’d rush back when there are a choice of restaurants locally.,Date of visit: June 2018,"Miller & Carter, Worcester Park",1,"Worcester Park, United Kingdom"
Enjoyable stay,"We stayed for 2 nights for £198. Continental breakfast available at additional cost. The hotel is in a great location just off Grey Street and 5 minutes walk from Monument Metro with lots of places to eat nearby. There are spacious lounge and bar areas with comfortable seating. The bar is open until 3am but only hotter guests can use it after midnight. Rooms have a boutique feel and the beds were comfortable. We moved to an upgraded room for the second night as there was a problem with our bathroom- a strong smell of damp/drains. My only criticism of the rooms is that in both rooms there was only a bedside table/shelf on one side of the bed so I had to move the chair/stool next to the other side of the bed so I had somewhere within easy reach to put my water, glasses, phone etc.",Date of stay: June 2018,Motel One Newcastle,1,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"
Great place to wander,We walked along the quayside during the day and at night and enjoyed it both times. The bridges are illuminated at night and there are plenty of bars along the river.,Date of experience: June 2018,The Quayside,1,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"
"Pie, mash, peas and liquor!","A great concept; choose your locally made pie (steak, minced beef and onion, chicken and leek, sausage, apple and cider to name a few) add mash (garlic, Dijon etc) then peas (mush, minted, pease pudding) and finally liquor (meat, parsley) all for £9.95. If you’re extra hungry you can add another pie for £3. Food was delicious and served on tin plates. Local beer great too!",Date of visit: June 2018,The Redhouse,1,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"
Stunning lights and lasers,When we booked I wasn’t sure that the £22 price tag for a peak period ticket was going to represent good value but it was worth it. We had a great evening despite the drizzle. The trail is about a mile long and the light installations are beautiful with lovely music to complement them. There are several opportunities to buy food and drinks but it’s all quite pricey (£5 for mulled wine). We paid the extra £7 to park by the Brentford gate entrance.,Date of experience: December 2017,"Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew",1,"Kew, United Kingdom"
Ok for one night,"We stayed for one night when visiting family in the area. Check in was quick and there was plenty of free parking. The corridors leading to the rooms reminded me of university halls or residence - slightly soulless with carpet that had seen better days. Our executive room was a good size although lacked some elements that I've come to expect of the HI chain. No biscuits or alternative teas on the refreshment tray. Bed was comfy and the wooden sliding shutters shut out any light. Breakfast buffet had a good choice but none of the cooked items were particularly warm. Only one peppermint tea bag available and not replenished despite my request.
The Christmas decorations in the lobby look as though they had seen better days.",Date of stay: November 2017,Holiday Inn Aylesbury,1,"Aylesbury, United Kingdom"
Can't wait to return,"We started and finished the evening by the log fire. Our waitress was friendly, efficient and clearly very knowledgable about the food and wine and happy to provide recommendations. We had the tasting menu with wine pairings; excellent value for money at £68 a head. The food was delicious with amazing flavours and textures. Highly recommended - just wish we lived nearby!",Date of visit: November 2017,The Chequers Inn,1,"Weston Turville, United Kingdom"
Lovely location,"We arrived by kayak and ate outside under one of the umbrellas. Staff were happy to help us shade ourselves from the midday sun. Good choice of food and drink - I recommend the passion fruit pina colada. I had the watermelon, feta and mint salad, generous portion and ideal for lunch in a hot day.",Date of stay: October 2017,Mar Vista Grande,1,"North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"
Stunning,You can't book so get here early to get a spot outside. The inside isn't particularly special but the outside seating is covered by large sails and is right on the intercostal waters with great views. We arrived by boat and there was plenty of room to moor outside. I had the house smoked fish pate - technically an appetiser but two huge mounds of smoked fish and 14 packs of crackers! My husband had the seafood lasagne. Good choice of beers. Live blues on Thursday evenings.,Date of visit: October 2017,Swordfish Grill,1,"Cortez, Florida"
Have the grouper!,Ate here as part of a large group of 20. We hadn't booked so there wasn't space outside but staff were happy to move tables around to accommodate us. They were also happy to divide the bill across multiple checks. Good choice of food and drinks. We opted for the fish tacos with mango salsa and the grouper. It wasn't cheap but the food was delicious.,Date of visit: October 2017,Bridge Tender Inn,1,"Anna Maria Island, Florida"
Great food and great atmosphere,Staff were attentive and great fun and there was generally a nice vibe about this restaurant. We shared the lettuce wraps as a starter- delicious and generous portions. Fish tacos and seafood grill made yummy main courses. The highlight for me was the 'pain in the a**' frozen cocktail- a combination of rum runner and pina colada!,Date of visit: October 2017,Fogarty's,1,"Key West, Florida"
Truffle fries!,Lovely restaurant above a clothes shop of the same name just off Armand Circle. Good size portions and attentive staff. The truffle fries are worth a visit on their own!,Date of visit: October 2017,Shore,1,"Sarasota, Florida"
Convenient,Stayed for one night before flying home. Very conviently located for MIA. Parking is in the multi-storey car park attached to the hotel not the parking lot to the side. We were given a late check out (1pm) at no extra charge. Room was good size and had a safe but no fridge. Good choice of food at the breakfast buffet. Outside pool if you've got time. Walgreens and Publix are within walking distance along with Wendy's and Burger King.,Date of stay: October 2017,Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton Miami Airport South - Blue Lagoon,1,"Miami, Florida"
Great customer service and location,Stayed for two nights. Check in was great with a friendly welcome and introduction to the area and tips on things to see and places to eat. Room was large and light with good amenities. We used the pool once - plenty of loungers and towels available. Breakfast selection was good. On check out we were offered bottles of water for the journey.,Date of stay: October 2017,Silver Palms Inn,1,"Key West, Florida"
$14 well spent,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Hemingway's Home.Our guide Doug was knowledgable and enthusiastic about the property and Hemingway himself. We met several of the 54 cats all descended from the original 6 toed cat given to Hemingway as they are supposed to bring good luck. Guided tours take place every half hour but you are also allowed to wander around the house at your leisure before or after the tour. It's worth getting there early as when we went past on our trolley tour later on there were people queueing to get in.,Date of experience: October 2017,The Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum,1,"Key West, Florida"
