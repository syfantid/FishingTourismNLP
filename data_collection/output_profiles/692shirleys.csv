Great guys,"Only really used for the water taxi to Coco beach but great set of guys , very friendly. We were fortunate to see some humpbacks on our way back and they stopped the boat so we could watch for a while",Date of experience: December 2019,ScubaCaribe,4,"Playa Matapalo, Costa Rica"

Just fantastic,"Amazing must go - zip lines brilliant and well looked after especially for 60 somethings , animals well looked after, good selection of snacks and drinks available",Date of experience: December 2019,Diamante Eco Adventure Park,4,"Playa Matapalo, Costa Rica"
Great food,"Beautiful setting, family run, great selection of traditional Greek food and at reasonable prices, we ate elsewhere but always found Panorama food tastiest",Date of visit: September 2019,Panorama Hotel Koukounaries,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Beautiful beach,"Lovely long beach with plenty of tavernas, sun beds and parasols provided plus plenty of watersports",Date of experience: September 2019,Koukounaries Beach,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Fantastic little Gem,"Stayed here for a week from the 18th September, it is an absolutely fantastic family run hotel. Dina , Apollo and everyone else are so friendly, welcoming and they cannot do enough for their guests. The hotel is spotless and rooms are cleaned every day with care, the bar area and restaurant has a great atmosphere and the food is quite honestly some of the best we have eaten in Greece. We give our great thanks to everyone at this little gem for a wonderful relaxing week and we shall be returning, cannot recommend enough. We were unlucky to be caught up in the Thomas Cook fallout but the help and support we got from the family was brilliant. We will be booking direct with Dina and Apollo next time",Date of stay: September 2019,Panorama Hotel,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Friendly small hotel with great food,"Stayed here for 2 weeks in mid May, Maria cannot do enough for you and is always on the go. This is a great little hotel and real value for money, rooms are cleaned daily and to a high standard, my only criticism would be the beds which we found a little too hard for our liking but that is personal taste. The food is authentic Greek and very tasty and if you prefer more garlic etc this is not a problem just ask. The Greek night is well worth it and hilarious - trust me you will get involved. The boys at the bar Angel and Sorteris are great and are happy to concoct whatever you want and are always on hand to help. The hotel is situated about 15 mins walk into Limenaria where you can find various Tavernas, Boat cruises, shops etc. We did the Ipsarien tour which was brilliant and views to die for. Would recommend Sunray hotel and Ipsarien tour without a doubt. On a final note thanks to our great rep Jess from TUI.",Date of stay: May 2019,Sunray Hotel,4,"Thásos, Greece"
Great beach,"Fantastic long beach , great for walking , surfing , care to be taken when swimming , a tad cold in December but to be expected. Watch out for the camels. Locals selling great doughnuts well worth the couple of quid",Date of experience: December 2018,Agadir Beach,4,"Agadir, Morocco"
Great for walking,"Brilliant for your daily walk, a long promenade giving ample space and views, be aware of the local hawks , just say no",Date of experience: December 2018,Seafront Promenade,4,"Agadir, Morocco"
Xmas and new year holiday,"We arrived a couple of days late following the Gatwick drone episode and initially thought the hotel was great after our fraught journey. As the days went by it was clearly obvious that we were amongst the youngest (We in our late 50's) . The majority of the clientele are French and aged around 70 + and extremely rude and arrogant , apparently thinking that because French is morocco's 2nd language they own the place. Sunbeds along with dining tables are saved for them and you are left to feel somewhat of a 2nd class citizen. The hotel is a little gem just waiting to be discovered by someone who is brave enough, gardens, pool area , general staff are 1st class but unfortunately you feel like you are in a retirement home. We have used our tablets for some music in the afternoons and the staff have smiled, laughed and been much happier . Avoid at all cost rooms 266 to 271 as these are situated above the show room which is ridiculously loud and you are unable to sleep until gone 11pm, important if you have an early pick up for excursions. The restaurant unless you eat very early sounds likes a works canteen, although some food is good , but very annoying nevertheless. Would we return - unfortunately NO , not felt at home here and TUI should take it off their books",Date of stay: December 2018,Hotel RIU Tikida Beach,4,"Agadir, Morocco"
Honest review whilst sitting in bar,"Beautiful hotel and grounds however entertainment is very poor , seems like "" one foot in the grave "" . If you are over 80 you might like it but we are young 50 somethings and would appreciate some decent entertainment. Food is mediocre as usual catering to the masses, dont expect any greek culinary specialities because you will be disappointed. Seriously considering saying bye bye to all inclusive to get away from the bun fights at meal times .",Date of stay: May 2018,TUI BLUE Oceanis Beach & Spa Resort,4,"Kós, Greece"
Amazing good honest Cuban food,"Found this little gem later in holiday and wished we found it earlier , really friendly and serves great food with choices of lobster , prawns , chicken and pork . Servings are large as we found out so unless you are mega hungry best go for sharing the plates. Definitely recommend",Date of visit: December 2017,El Cacique,4,Cuba
So good we booked again for next year,"Stayed here 27th August for a week , really comfortable and very clean apartment. Cannot recommend enough ! Mary is fantastic with her never ending smile and so welcoming manner, George at the bar cannot go without a mention as he will do anything for you and always ready to get you a long cool drink after a busy day sightseeing. The area itself is beautiful and needs to be explored. As with other reviews we would recommend a torch if you are returning late at night. The walk is probably under ten minutes (in the morning) but we were there in 34 degrees and it did take a little longer in the afternoon when the sun bore down.
The only down side that we found was that the shower heads did not behave themselves and flooded the bathroom frequently amidst various screams !!
we have already booked again for next September and cannot wait to return.",Date of stay: August 2017,Aligis Studios,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Just Fantastic Food !,"Found Captain Jerry's on our first day and totally honestly did not bother going anywhere else. The food and staff are outstanding , as is the ambience , we could not remember happily spending so much time over lunch or dinner , also the staff are happy to leave you be and enjoy your meal without constant interruption .They offer free sunbeds during the day if you are spending with the Taverna and the total experience is great. You don't need to be a fish lover to eat here either as they also offer some great meat dishes such as lamb and pork chops, chicken, beef etc. Please try the mussels or prawn saganaki - you will not be disappointed , the sauce is to die for !! Don't go here for a diet - big portions but so tasty and authentic Greece. Jerry - we will see you next September - already booked !! and cannot wait",Date of visit: August 2017,Captain Jerry's,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Just Beautiful,"Such a lovely beach, quiet and serene feeling, had one guy who insisted having to listen to a UK radio phone in show - these people are ignorant - sorry . Waters are really shallow and clear, just a wonderful beach",Date of experience: August 2017,Katelios beach,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
An amazing day out,"You have just got to go - no doubts ! A brilliant day out with Dimitrios and Efi , they are such a lovely couple and will go out of their way to ensure you enjoy your day, They set their nets at 3am in the morning and you then join them at 8am when they collect their nets and you get to see what was caught. You also get the chance to swim in amazing clear waters whilst Efi prepares a wonderful lunch with the fish that was caught along with salad and bread etc. Muhammed was a great laugh and you can help him to empty the nets. It is a day that no one should miss and we thoroughly recommend it. We are returning to Kefalonia next September and will be sure to catch up with Dimitrios and Efi again.",Date of experience: August 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
In reply to Niels w 1 star review,"How on earth you can rate this as 1 star is totally beyond us and many return guests. You have insulted the Cuban hospitality and the many wonderful people at this hotel. I would suggest you stay away and never return as we would not desire such negative people at the resort. We are about to return for our 4th visit and know that we shall be met with the 5 star service we experienced on our first visit to our very last day .if you cannot appreciate the hospitality that all Cubans give their heart and soul to ensuring you have a wonderful time then please find somewhere else for your vacation , or stay in your little cocoon.",Date of stay: January 2016,Paradisus Rio de Oro Resort & Spa,4,Cuba
Disappointing after reading other reviews,"Good first overall impression having arrived early to find our room available and upon entering really impressed with the size of the apartment, we then found out that the bar was closed on Mondays, no problem, we would walk to the beach ! Where other reviews talk about it being 15 mins away (is there a short cut ) we finally arrived some 35 mins later , and we are not slow walkers , having had a 3am start by the time we got back we were k'd. Some 15 min walk - not ! Beds were really hard and uncomfortable and the setter in our apartment had definitely seen better days. Also surprised that we were so far out of Albufeira and taxi fares cost us 10 Euro each way. Overall not a particularly user friendly place, didn't find the pool area to be a relaxing area and given the uncomfortable beds would not return to these apartments. We will beyond a doubt return to Portugal as we found the people very friendly and helpful , local restaurants are really good , we particularly enjoyed O Girassol (probably not spelt correctly) and Prima Pasta, best pasta in Albufeira, and last but not least the Polu Sul across the road for their amazing breakfasts, cakes and coffees. (Shame about the noise from the sports bar next door ) - do you really need to watch football when on holiday ?",Date of stay: September 2016,Jardins Vale de Parra,4,"Albufeira, Portugal"
Good authentic pasta,"Was recommended by another couple at our apartments and first night was brilliant, we both really enjoyed our meals and I was overwhelmed by the size of the desert but nevertheless, had to eat it ! The second night we returned my husband found the lasagne to be quite salty and not to his tasting. However we would return if in the area",Date of visit: September 2016,Prima Pasta,4,"Albufeira, Portugal"
"3rd time back , still our top destination","Visited from 22nd December for 2 weeks , our first time over the Xmas period and have already booked to return next Xmas. Another wonderful experience , the staff here really make you feel at home and will do their utmost to make sure you enjoy your holiday and have a memorable time.
We tended to eat at the buffet most of the time and you would have to be a very picky eater not to be able to find something you like, We must also congratulate the chefs who created the wonderful Xmas eve display and the even more impressive new years eve display, absolute masterpieces.
The newly renovated pool area is a great place to chill out and read, or meet new friends around the bar.
Our special thanks go to Rolando, Aimee, Tulensis, Ylensis, Adanalis, Luis Manuel, Miriam, Alien, Maylin , Katia , Yolanda, Pablo who all went out of their way to give us a good time, and finally to Mirian and Jean-Marc for our very special Renewing of vows ceremony, a day we will never forget.",Date of stay: December 2015,Paradisus Rio de Oro Resort & Spa,4,Cuba
Great food and hosts,"Have stayed here twice now on business, the 2nd time being a party of 9 people and can honestly say that this is the best Italian food our party had tasted. The rooms are excellent and very nicely decorated, the one I was in had a Jacuzzi bath and flat screen tv in the bathroom, really nice to unwind after a hard day. All of our party enjoyed their stay and all loved the food and the ambience. No problem in recommending this place whatsoever.",Date of stay: December 2015,La Fontana,4,"East Hanney, United Kingdom"
very disappointing !!,"Having read the reviews on the Alimuri we were very excited and looking forward to a great holiday BUT : - During our stay we knew of at least a dozen people including ourselves that suffered from what can only be described as appalling food hygiene problems.
1) If you wanted a hot breakfast - it was at best luke warm or more often than not - Cold, if you prefer a cup of tea in the morning beware of the leaking kettle which if your toes are in the way you will be scolded !
2) Buffet lunch - remember that the food is sat out in 30 degree plus heat for a long while, anything that should be cold is warm and breeding germs, anything that should be hot is either warm , getting cooler or undercooked.
3) Evening meal, rotated between waiter service or buffet, again unfortunately buffet food is brought out in large quantities too early and much of it is cold and inedible, unless you like chips. The waiter service does vary but let's be honest and say that they have to take all of the s..t that the management have caused, we found them to be polite and very helpful.
We were not the only people to complain during our stay , but we were fortunate to meet the owner who was appalled at our and colleagues comments , and promised to change hygiene practices, that same evening we were served pork and chicken that was raw in the centre.
The beach is very small and invaded by locals and not private (if you can call it a beach) , the pool bar is a death-trap being a foot -ish away from the pool , on a slippery surface and we witnessed people slipping frequently, as is the same with the toilets downstairs with people having to walk when they are wet.
Can we say on the plus side the majority of the staff are very friendly and exceedingly helpful , not so much the reception staff / managers who want to shrug their shoulders,it wasn't until we spoke to the owner and the director of the hotel and they were more concerned with fobbing us off with freebies, good luck to the general staff and the trips were fabulous.
Will not be returning",Date of stay: August 2015,Mar Hotel Alimuri,4,"Meta, Italy"
another great holiday at PRDO,"This was our second trip to Cuba and PRDO and it did not disappoint. Personally I have never returned to the same hotel twice in all my years of travelling, but there is something about this place that makes you want to keep coming back. The staff are all absolutely fantastic and will do anything for you and make you feel so welcome. You have so many restaurants to choose from even the pickiest of people would have no trouble finding something to eat. The rooms are really spacious and the beds huge and comfortable, I only wish I could fit one in our bedroom at home ! Yes parts of the hotel are a little dated but the Cubans do their up most and very best to make your holiday special and can only think that the negative responses come from people that can't chill out . We will be back at Xmas for another two weeks and will continue to return as long as we can afford it. The beach is amazing and we love feeding the fish by the rocks. Anyone going should book a half day fishing trip where they take you out on the reef and you eat what you catch, it's great fun, good fishing, good eating, and a really great day. Get out there , meet the locals, see the real Cuba and enjoy !!",Date of stay: March 2015,Paradisus Rio de Oro Resort & Spa,4,Cuba
Stunning Location - But...,"The hotel does have an absolutely stunning location and I can only think that other reviews of ""marvellous"" ""exceptional"" ""brilliant"" were drawn in by the location alone. We also think that the hotels own web site is over representing what you actually receive. We upgraded to a sea view room in order to get air conditioning (which is a must) and to our thoughts help with the mozzie control - even though we had a net over the bed we actually got bitten whilst sleeping and found mozzies inside the net. 50% deet is an absolute must but even then most guests were bitten quite badly and there is not enough control from the hotel to keep these at bay. In one week that we were there, they only smoked the grounds once which is totally inadequate. Please don't be fooled into believing that this is a four star hotel, we have travelled extensively and have experienced far better 3 star hotels than this and is the reason why we have only rated Cocobay as average, when considering the price you have to pay for a stay of one week , it is at best full board with a few drinks. No coffee or tea is available until 7.30am at breakfast, yes, you do have coffee making facilities in the room but quite honestly it is pretty dire. We have never ever been to an All Inclusive resort where you have to pay for bottled water, we were given 3 small bottles as complimentary on our first day and after that you had to buy them in the shop at $2 a bottle, you can fill up empty bottles at the bar but I'm sorry but it did not taste that good. Food-wise we would grade as ""fair"" , breakfast is the same every morning, not much choice , lunch is pretty much the same and as regards dinner we think they are trying to over complicate matters, you have to pay for anything regarded as special i.e. steak, lobster, scallops, prawns , something again we have never experienced in our many years of travelling and do not expect when you have paid what we consider a premium price to visit the island. We were also very surprised to see an ""under 16"" on our last day as we were led to believe that this was an adults only resort and the reason we booked it. During the week we stayed there were a couple of nights entertainment which was good and much relief from the dullness of the day. There is no background music whatsoever during the day and quite frankly you could have been anywhere in the world and not known you were in the Caribbean, even staff that we spoke to and other guests would have liked to have some sort of background music just to let us all know where we were ! We actually felt like we were in ""gods waiting room"", we are no youngsters but if staff feel that music is lacking then there is something wrong, perhaps that is because the resort is owned by someone who is not a true Caribbean person and therefore do they really know what is Caribbean life? Lastly when swimming on the beach we aware of the jet ski's , there are no restrictive areas and they come and go as they please. Very last word goes to the staff that did make our holiday , as we found some of the staff quite arrogant and rude, the people we would like to thank are Vincia , Davaran, Sasha, Kenya and last but not least the mad Robert. Thanks to you all.",Date of stay: October 2014,Cocobay Resort (Antigua),4,Antigua

Very disappointed,"My wife visited this heritage site many years ago before we were married, the reason we went to Antigua was to see my grandfathers heritage but very disappointed to see that it has all been yachtified and commercialised rubbish. None of the original documents are now on view and wouldn't bother wasting my money.",Date of experience: October 2014,Nelson's Dockyard,4,Antigua
dont accept room 45,"Stayed for one night on a business trip, can't fault the restaurant or the staff. I was allocated room no 45 and at first glance nothing appeared to be wrong, until I retired to bed after a long day and a full day of meetings to get through plus a long drive home the following day. I was kept awake until way gone midnight as the room is above the kitchens and all you can hear is the clanking of pots and pans being cleared. Once this stopped the generators (?) or freezers kept clicking on and off and I ended up with about 2hrs sleep all night. Will definitely find another hotel when I next return to this area.",Date of stay: September 2014,The Casa Hotel,4,"Yateley, United Kingdom"
Returned 18th March and already booked for next year,"Brilliant brilliant and more so !!!! This is the first time we have come back from a holiday and booked again within 2 days to go back. We were so laid back and relaxed we even forgot one of our trips which has never happened before but that was not a problem (""you are on holiday we can sort it"") . This place has to be seen and visited to be believed, all the staff are absolutely wonderful and will do anything to make you feel special for the very little money they receive. Rooms are comfortable , some are a little dated but who cares when you are in tropical paradise, you only sleep in them ! Our special thanks go to the pool bar staff namely Alien, Maylin, Luis, George, Louis and big man Chang and of course our maid Esdelvis , but all other staff who unfortunately I cant spell or remember their names were also fantastic and thanks to the pool man for our lovely clean and refreshing pool which was much welcomed. May I just add that if everybody who stays at this wonderful resort pays 1 cuc a day their lives would be so much easier. We have travelled extensively around the world and this is one place that we would be happy to return to time and time again. Everybody we met from tour guides, local people and staff were so friendly and informative , you really feel that you are making a friend for life and we cannot wait to return next year. We were amazed how safe this country is and would happily recommend it to anyone (male or female) to travel on their own. Thankyou Paradisus Rio De Oro for making our holiday so special - see you next year !! Love you all",Date of stay: March 2014,Paradisus Rio de Oro Resort & Spa,4,Cuba
Needs bombing and rebuilt,"Stayed at the Marinda Gardens for a week from the 30th August and travelled with two teenage sons aged 14 and 17. We have travelled extensively staying in many many different resorts all over the world ranging from 3 star to 5 star. On this holiday we wanted a reasonably priced resort with amenities for the boys to enjoy and also for ourselves, and looking at various reports we thought that Marinda would fit the bill. How wrong could we be !!! If not for the water park we would have spent hundreds of euros to entertain the boys. For those reporting a ""brilliant holiday"" we can only assume that you mean you ignore your kids to everybody's elses annoyance to let them run riot , do what they want , and generally get under everybody else's feet all night long. The food is good and varied albeit luke warm at most times, the staff are good , entertainment is good after 9.30 if you can endure that long after the kids stuff etc. Rooms are , to be totally honest, very very poor. We never had a good nights sleep over the seven days we stayed , the beds creaked and moaned and I even stripped one as we thought it had a plastic mattress cover on it , but no, it was just the bed unfortunately. Cleaning was also another issue that we have not encountered in many years of travelling, if you were to walk around the room in bare feet then they would be black, also looking under the beds to check for the kids socks etc we were shocked to see the state of the floor which had probably not been cleaned for some weeks. The pool areas are never hosed down , the pool always had plastic cups, bottles, rubbish floating around which was never cleaned. The attitude of ""some guest"" in looking after their children was very poor in terms of allowing them to dispose of their rubbish wherever they desired. On our final ""thankfully"" last morning we learned from a fellow guest that they had mice in their room and their little son had been sleeping in the bed that the mice had been taking their bedding from !!! If anybody thinks this is a 3 star and a brilliant holiday then please get real !!!!. This should be a minus 1 star and Thomas Cook should not renew any contract for this miserable resort. Its in a fabulous position but no-one seems to care.",Date of stay: August 2013,Marinda Garden Aparthotel,4,"Menorca, Spain"
