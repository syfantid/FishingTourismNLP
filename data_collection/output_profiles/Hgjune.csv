Airport Transfer,"We travelled with the taxi service from the airport to Sami and back at the end of our holiday. The drivers were friendly, local and English speaking. Drivers were punctual and pricing was reasonable and transparent. Great communication throughout. Very accommodating, even when we made late changes to our plans. Wouldnâ€™t hesitate to use again.",Date of experience: July 2019,Kefalonia Taxi Service,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Sunset fishing,Our family (with two boys aged 7 and 10) had a wonderful sunset fishing trip with Antonia and Michalis. This is a unique experience and one of the best things we did in our time on Kefalonia. Antonia made us feel very welcome and provided us with some of the best food we ate during our trip. This is a beautiful fishing boat and a real fishing experience. Highly recommended.,Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
