Absolutely amazing day out,"This trip is by far one of the best trips I’ve done in my life.loved the trip from start to end, you get to see a lot of places and learn insider knowledge of fishing in Zante.the Captain is amazing really friendly,all the crew are welcoming. After you catch your fish the cook on board prepares an amazing meal.I don’t usually like fish but this fish was amazing.definitely recommend this to everyone ignore the price and just book it. Well worth it.",Date of experience: June 2018,Zante Fishing Tours,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
