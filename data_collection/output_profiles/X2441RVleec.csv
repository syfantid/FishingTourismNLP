Big Disappointment..,Went to Nonna's Kitchen last night and was looking forward to it after hearing some good reports on it from friends and family. We was there with a party of 19 people for my sisters birthday. The restaurant looks great from the inside and out and the display of cakes and cooked meats looked amazing. It wasn't very busy and only about 4 or 5 other tables were seated. The service was very poor and it took quite some time before we were offered drinks. We finally ordered our starters and main courses and I decided on the Caprisi salad to start and the fillet steak for main course. The starters were OK but nothing special. When the waitress brought my steak to the table and put it down in front of me the smell coming from it wasn't quite right. I cut into the meat and could tell straight away it was off.. A really pungent cheesy smell was coming from the steak. I asked of friends and family members to smell it and make sure it wasn't just me and they all agreed it was not right. We called the waitress over and told her about it and she took it away and asked if I would like another one. The smell from it put me off so asked for a pizza instead. We could see the manager and chefs in the kitchen all having a smell of the fillet when it was returned. I was very disappointed that the manager or the chef didn't come over to apologize about it. I definitely wont be going back in a hurry and was left very disappointed. A real shame as the place really does look nice.,Date of visit: December 2015,Nonna's Kitchen,4,"Hoddesdon, United Kingdom"
