Amazing experience!!!,"We had a great day with you guys. We went for fishing with nets and fishing robs.we were lucky because our catch was full of shrimps and our lunch was delicious. We went to the beach ""White Rocks"" which has access only by the sea and it was amazing and clean. I think this experience is for all ages and I recommend it to all of you...",Date of experience: July 2018,Poseidon Fishing Tourism Kefalonia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
