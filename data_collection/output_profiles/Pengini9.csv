A Perfect Day on the Beautiful Ionian!,Our extended family group of 10- ages 3 to 69- thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful boat trip. Efi & Dimitri were lovely warm hosts. Lots of fish caught in the nets which young and old were delighted to watch come in. The secluded swimming spot we were taken to was paradise on earth. Our catch was perfectly cooked- absolutely delicious with plenty of food (and drink) to go around. We will remember this day for many years to come. Highly recommended!,Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
