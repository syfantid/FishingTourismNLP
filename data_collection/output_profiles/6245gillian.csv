Shepherds Hut,"We had a great stay in the luxury Shepherds hut. It was early March and the weather outside was terrible overnight. The hut had heating and was warm dry and cosy. Amazing how much you can fit into a small space. It was beautiful decorated and the bed extremely comfortable. Inside there is a double bed, tv, chairs table and tea and coffee making facilities. The owners also put in some welcome additional items such as wine, chocolates and biscuits. There is a beautiful view over the lake and if the weather had been better a table and chairs outside. The shower block nearby is also warm and clean with a separate kitchen block if required which has kettle, toaster and microwave. The owners were extremely friendly and helpful. We would highly recommend a stay here.",Date of stay: March 2020,Ty Coch Camping and Caravanning,4,"St. Brides Wentlooge, United Kingdom"
Great place to stop for lunch,Great place to stop for lunch or a quick coffee and cake. Everything is homemade and delicious. There’s plenty of seating both indoor and out with some lovely views. We always stop here on our way to Falmouth the hardest point is choosing what to have.,Date of visit: January 2020,Yummy Scrummy,4,"Devoran, United Kingdom"
If Carlsberg made Christmas cakes,"So it seems that in a cunning ongoing plan to make us put on weight the master chef at A Slice Of Life has done the impossible by creating a Christmas cake that is even better than last years! If you like Christmas cake you will not find one better but get there quick as we’ll be back for more! Other delicious homemade cakes, homemade lunches and cream teas are available and to be honest they are all amazing so eat them and leave the Christmas cake for us!",Date of visit: November 2019,A slice of life cafe,4,"Westward Ho, United Kingdom"
Sunday lunch well worth a visit,"Fantastic roast lunch. Definitely one of the best. Excellent choice of 4 meats, 2 veggie options and a huge selection of vegetables. Very friendly and welcoming. Couldn’t fault it.",Date of visit: November 2019,The Cyder Presse Pub,4,"Bideford, United Kingdom"
Perfect holiday,"Oasis’s apartments are typically Greek very similar to places we have previously stayed in. A welcome bottle of water is provided along with some toiletries, shower gel, soap, washing up liquid and even slippers. There is also a hairdryer, toaster, kettle and microwave. What makes the Oasis stand out as special is Mike & Elena, their family & staff. From the minute you get there your suitcases are whisked away to your room and Mike sits you down, gives you a free drink of your choice and gives you a welcome talk. He explains how to get into town and gives you a map of Skiathos pointing out places to visit etc. The gardens are amazing filled with hammocks, cushioned swing chairs, a fish pond and table tennis area. There are plenty of sun beds with cushioned mattresses around the pool so absolutely no need to reserve any. Each afternoon free watermelon is brought around for everyone along with iced water with lemon and mint. Mike also gave us one of the best days of our holiday by taking us and a group of others out on their boats. This was an amazing experience (thanks Mike & captain Elena) it is not a case as one previous review said of your face fitting The family welcomes everyone and if you happen to be there when he’s taking the boat out he invites you. Everyone is made to feel welcome. The bar area is really comfortable and food is excellent and well priced. There is also a happy hour each day, a quiz and various other events. The walk into town is about 10 mins max with waterfront tavernas even closer. Highly recommend is a visit to Mylos to watch the planes come in. We don’t often return to places and prefer to try different islands each year but Skiathos had so much to see we felt 2 weeks weren’t enough and definitely plan to return and stay at Oasis.",Date of stay: August 2019,Oasis,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Best sardine ever!,We visited here twice and the first time had the sardines which were delicious. We watched a couple share a sea bass which was enormous and was boned at the table for them by the waiter then drizzled with olive oil and lemon juice. It came with potatoes and salad to share. We shared a joke that their sardine was bigger than ours and decided to return and try this for ourselves. It was the most delicious fish we have ever eaten. The staff here are genuinely happy and make you feel very welcome. There is also live Greek music playing which adds to the atmosphere. Just be aware that the sea bass on the menu is a much smaller portion and if ordering to share you pay by the kilo. It’s worth asking if unsure. If you enjoy fish we highly recommend trying this.,Date of visit: August 2019,Hellinikon Restaurant,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Great traditional food,The food here was fantastic. The bread was toasted on the grill and came with a huge pot of olive paste. The mains had added mushrooms and carrots which tasted like they had also been cooked on the grill. All meals we have had in Skiathos have been great but this one stood out as being extra tasty. Prices were extremely good too.,Date of visit: August 2019,Old Street,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Brilliant quirky place,A brilliant place right next to the sea front to either sit and have a drink or meal and watch the world go by. Really enjoyed our meals here of lamb flatbread and flat iron steak. Both were delicious and served by extremely friendly staff. Would definitely return if we are in the area again.,Date of visit: September 2018,Pilchards Cafe,4,"Port Isaac, United Kingdom"
Great nights sleep,"We had a fabulous time in Port Issac and can highly recommend this B&B. It is located in easy walking distance of the village of port Issac made famous as the location where they film Doc Martin. Steve welcomed us warmly and helped us park right outside. He then showed us to our room and gave us lots of helpful information about the area. The room was very clean and modern. It was at the back of the house and extremely peaceful with possibly the most comfortable beds we have ever slept on. There was plenty of tea, coffee and biscuits in the room with a supply on the landing if we wanted more. Breakfast was full English with all the trimmings plus a selection of cereal fresh fruit and yogurt. Oh and the tea was real not bags which is a rare find but much appreciated. Overall a great example of a B&B run by a friendly couple who have got everything right.",Date of visit: September 2018,Terrace Tea Rooms,4,"Port Isaac, United Kingdom"
Love this place,This place is amazing! Excellent value amazing food and extremely friendly staff. Visit every time we are in Cardiff just wish we lived closer. Just like being in Greece.,Date of visit: September 2018,The Hellenic Eatery,4,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"
Hight recommended,Came here twice and although everywhere we ate in Parga was amazing this was our favourite. The staff are extremely happy and friendly. First visit we had grilled calamari which was cooked to perfection and had the fish platter for 2 on our second visit which was so delicious. This was great value at €24 for 2. You can find this place on the main road heading out of the harbour keep left past the shops rather than walk past the beach and it is on the right after a couple of minutes. Well before the BP garage.,Date of visit: August 2018,La Barca,4,"Parga, Greece"
Highly recommended,Had a lovely stay here. We had a ground floor apartment which as others have mentioned don’t have much privacy on the balcony however this wasn’t a problem and was really quite useful for storing the inflatables. The balcony did get the sun so no problem drying towels but because it is slightly lower down it seemed to keep the apartment cooler so we managed without air conditioning. The pool is lovely and the whole place kept very clean. Staff are all very friendly especially the barman (thanks for ‘THE LIST’ our retirement plans are being made! Also thanks to the cheerful cleaners who came in every day and kept the place spotless they were always smiling and always said hello. Bar snacks are available from the pool bar during the day. Location is good - a short walk into town with plenty shops and restaurants on the way. Parga itself is a lovely resort with lots to see and do. We would definitely return one day and happily stay here again.,Date of stay: June 2018,Elena Hotel Apartments,4,"Parga, Greece"
Well worth a visit,"We visited here before our meal one evening and really enjoyed it. We had often wondered how and when the olives are harvested and the video at the beginning answered all our questions. A lovely lady then showed us around and explained how all the old machines work. It was cool inside and nice to escape the heat for a while. After being shown around you then go to the kitchen area where you taste various oils with bread and some salad dressing with citrus fruit, mustard and honey. These were delicious. They explained what to look for when buying and cooking with olive oil to get the health benefits. There was no pressure at all to make any purchases afterwards. All in all this was extremely good value at €5 per person. Highly recommended.",Date of experience: August 2018,Paragaea - Old Olive Oil Factory,4,"Parga, Greece"
River walk and boat trip,"We did both the river walk to the springs and the separate boat trip from Parga up the river. Both trips were amazing and completely different. The river walk was a bus trip takes about 30 minuets on the bus. Take shoes for walking in the river and a waterproof bag for your belongings but keep what you carry to a minimum. The water is cold but amazing and you don’t notice the temperature as you’re having too much fun. There are a couple of nice cafes to have a drink and snack. Activities are available and you can just turn up and pay. Kayaking, rafting, pony trekking and archery (archery was for small children and looked a bit tame). We enjoyed the day so much we wanted to see the other side of the river so took at boat trip for €14 from the harbour area. It left at 10am and sailed up to the entrance to the river giving us some great views of Parga and the coast. We then had a very beautiful and tranquil trip up river. It was very scenic and peaceful with lots of dragonflies, kingfishers and butterflies. We stopped at Armoudia for an hour for coffee then sailed around to and actually into a cave. The boat then took us to Lichenos beach where we could have lunch or a swim or both. Take towels on this trip. We were given free choice of how long to stay at the beach as our ticket covered any water taxi. I would highly recommend both of the trips.",Date of experience: August 2018,Acheron River,4,"Parga, Greece"
Traditional Greek food,Went here twice as we enjoyed it so much the first time. We tried the fish and the meat all good portions and extremely tasty. Free welcome drink on arrival and watermelon with the bill were welcome additions.,Date of visit: August 2018,Taverna Krioneri,4,"Parga, Greece"
Great place to watch the world go by,Fantastic bar with a nice cool space to sit outside and watch the world go by. Johnny and his family are extremely welcoming. Exchanged a few words in Greek with his mum who made a a delicious plate of tapas to go with our beer.,Date of visit: July 2018,Johnnys Place,4,"Parga, Greece"
Perfect food perfect view,Had a lovely meal here. Well worth the climb up the steps. Grilled kalamari was perfect as was the kleftico. The views are amazing and the atmosphere relaxing. Free watermelon was a nice touch at the end. Will definitely return.,Date of visit: August 2018,Flisvos Restaurant,4,"Parga, Greece"
Fantastic,Booked a table here for my daughter’s birthday as we love our holidays in Greece and the fabulous food. This place was the best exactly like the food you get on holiday at a highly reasonable price. We were made to feel extremely welcome and it was great to have Greek music playing in the background with a video of Greece playing on the tv. Looked like they also do take away. Wish we lived closer but we will definitely be back next time we are in Cardiff.,Date of visit: April 2018,The Hellenic Eatery,4,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"
Great budget hotel,"This hotel is extremely basic but the prices reflect this. We stayed in a double room which was definitely the bare basics but everything was clean and although to get into the shower you virtually had to climb over the toilet the shower was clean and powerful. The location is ideal easy walking distance to Trafalgar Square etc. Parking is free outside on a weekend so this is a huge bonus. We had the breakfast which was a real bargain at £4.50 and very nice. A good range of cereals, yogurts, fruit, hard boiled eggs, toast and hot and cold drinks. All in all a good bargain place for a night but wouldn’t want to stay much longer.",Date of stay: April 2018,Belgrave House Hotel London Victoria,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Would recommend,Popped in for a quick bite and a coffee. A huge range of lasagna and pasta. The portions are enormous and food was really tasty. We couldn’t finish so were offered a box to take away our leftovers. This was enough to also feed our hungry teenage son! Coffee was great too. Much bigger inside than it looks on the street would definitely return.,Date of visit: January 2018,Mister Lasagna Belgravia,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Clean comfortable and handy for O2,"Stayed for one night. Clean room, comfortable bed and decent self service breakfast. Especially impressed all the by the polite helpful reception staff. 10 mins walk to O2. Had a drink in the bar on returning in the evening- nice relaxing atmosphere. Complimentary daily papers a welcome addition.",Date of stay: January 2018,Holiday Inn Express London - Greenwich,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Great food friendly atmosphere,"Really nice food and extremely friendly staff. We’re were a party of 4 and tried the garlic mushrooms, olives, sharp and salty pizza, steaks and a burger. Everyone was very happy with their meal. Lovely red wine too. Highly recommended.",Date of visit: November 2017,Flame Factory,4,"Appledore, United Kingdom"
Peaceful and friendly,"Spent a lovely 2 weeks here. Thank you Nicos for the lovely welcome sorry we missed saying goodbye in the morning. These apartments are traditionally Greek in style. We were in the old block but think this was the best option as the balcony had some shade. They are well laid out with plug sockets by the dressing table and bedside plus plenty of hanging space. Aircon is €5 per day, we didn't need it the first week but it worked well the second week when there was a heat wave. The pool area is lovely with plenty of sunbeds. The bar served a good range of snacks I can recommend the halloumi salad - delicious! It's about a 10 minute flat walk to the resort centre where there is a good range of tavernas. There are no noisy bars. The beach is nice quite narrow and slightly pebbly in places but very shallow and sandy underfoot once you're in the water. The sunbeds are free if you use the ones belonging to the tavernas. This was ideal for a day on the beach as there was food and drink available plus use of their toilets. We found the beach cooler than the pool during the heat wave. It was our first visit to cephalonia and the whole island was very scenic so would recommend a couple of days car hire as there was a lot to see. The BBQ and lamb nights held at the apartments are good value and the food is excellent. It is possible to walk to the next beach. Turn left at the beach and walk along the beach and over the rocks. The path is marked by a series of ribbons etc tied along the way so you know which path to use. It takes about 30 mins and there is a beautiful sandy beach with a lovely taverna and sunbeds. Katelios is a peaceful resort with enough tavernas to try a different one every day for 2 weeks. There is a water taxi to different areas leaving from the harbour daily and a fabulous fishing trip with fishing tourism which I can highly recommend. All in all we would happily return to these apartments and see why so many people do so each year.",Date of stay: August 2017,Eryphilli,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
The best trip ever,"This is the most perfect way to spend a day. Starting with breakfast on board the boat this day includes bringing the fishing nets in and helping to unload the fish if you like or just take photos if you prefer. Then some swim stops in crystal clear water to deserted beaches and to cover ourselves with the natural clay. You are made to feel so welcome and the lovely Effi cooks the fish and serves it with a delicious salad, potatoes, bread and wine. There are plenty of drinks in a cool box throughout the day. This is a day everyone, young or old would enjoy it was truly perfect. Many happy memories made here.",Date of experience: August 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Very friendly & spotlessly clean,Just returned from a 2 night much needed break to recharge the batteries. We were made to feel very welcome in this very comfortable home. Room was very spacious and clean and comfortable. The breakfast was superb too. Thanks for the tip re the fish curry at the Blue Peter it was delicious. Polpero is a lovely spot and Natal house has the ideal location with the added bonus of parking. Highly recommended.,Date of stay: April 2017,Natal House Bed & Breakfast,4,"Polperro, United Kingdom"
Well worth a visit,"This place is fabulous. Access via the outside lift or stairs/lift inside. The views are amazing. It's comfortable, cool and has a pool on the roof. The barman who starts at 4pm was a star, always very happy and cheerful and we were made to feel very welcome.",Date of experience: August 2016,Sky Bar,4,"Crete, Greece"
Beautiful location,"As others have said the transfer is quite long and you will be dropped on the road and sent with few directions down a pretty alley. Turn right at the sea and you will find Hiona a little way along. Remember this is Thomas Cook not Hiona not giving directions. This was our 2nd visit with teenagers and there have been some changes since last year. The wall between Hiona and Elounda Sunrise has been removed and the Hiona bar closed. This seemed to benefit the Elounda Sunrise customers more as the Hiona pool is bigger with better quality sun beds so the Hiona pool was much busier than in previous years. We did prefer it with the wall up however we enjoyed the quiz night and boat trips that the Elounda Sunrise offered and all the staff there were also very friendly. If the Elounda Sunrise upgraded their sun beds and put a few more out it would help the problem. The Hiona apartments are typical Greek style, well maintained and cleaned regularly. They are located at the causeway end of Elounda and have truly stunning views. There are plenty of places nearby to eat out. You will be made to feel very welcome and despite preferring the 2 apartments being separated we will still return here again. There is something special about Elounda and the Hiona location.",Date of stay: September 2016,Hiona Apartments,4,"Crete, Greece"
Teenagers introduction to diving,We booked an introduction to diving for my 15 year old son and a lady from Blue Dolphin school came and collected him from our apartments in Elounda and brought him back afterwards. He had an amazing time and said he received excellent training and it was well organised and safe with good quality equipment. They spent a lot of time in the sea and saw lots of different fish. The cost was £75 euros. I definitely recommend this to others.,Date of experience: August 2016,Diving Centre Blue Dolphin,4,"Crete, Greece"
Welcoming and peaceful,Couldn't fault this place. We sadly only stayed for one night but were looked after very well. The bed was extremely comfortable and the breakfast excellent. The location is very pretty and peaceful. The owners kindly booked a table for us at the local pub for our evening meal and took the trouble to inform them it was my husbands birthday so there were balloons waiting for us at the table. Hopefully we will return one day.,Date of stay: May 2016,Vine House B&B and Self-Catering,4,"Guilsfield, United Kingdom"
Fantastic,"I can't recommend this place enough. It's a converted farmhouse near the church in Instow serving meals and B&B. The restaurant is lovely with very comfortable chairs and nice decor. The food and service is superb and you are made to feel extremely welcome. Menus are small and change each week but take a look at past menus on their Facebook page to get an idea of what to expect. They are happy to cater for special requirements if asked in advance. Meals are £22 for 2 courses or £25 for 3. This includes a cocktail and canapés to begin with. These were all delicious with generous portions. Everything is locally sourced and home made. The food is of a very high standard, possibly the best I've ever had. This place is a hidden gem. Make sure you go as they have got this week place so right. Creating a perfect balance of a relaxing atmosphere and great food served with a warm welcome. It's necessary to book first.",Date of visit: May 2016,Instow Barton restaurant,4,"Instow, United Kingdom"
Everything you want from a pub plus more,Eaten here several times. It never disappoints. It can cater from a relaxing pub meal in the bar area or has a restaurant area with superb views for a more special occasion. The food is always of a high quality. The nachos are my favourite even since they stopped serving my favourite the vegetarian version! I'm not a vegetarian but they were really good. It's best to book the restaurant area but you can just walk in for a bar meal. Always made to feel welcome in the friendly atmosphere. Dogs are welcomed in the bar.,Date of visit: April 2016,The Beaver Inn,4,"Appledore, United Kingdom"
This place is amazing,Having spent many fun days here when the children were younger it was a privilege to be allowed to return this weekend in a fundraising capacity. Friday evening 200 teenagers had a fabulous time putting down their electronic devices for a nights fun in the indoor play area. Sadly the roller coaster couldn't run for safety issues due to the terrible weather but this did not prevent them from thoroughly enjoying the evening. It was a huge success. Saturday and Sunday we were allowed to set up a static bike and fundraise. All proceeds from these events went to our Bideford college expedition to Ecuador with camps international where we will be working hard to improve living standards for rural communities. All the staff at the Big Sheep go the extra mile to help ensure events like this are a huge success I can not thank them enough. You lot are amazing.,Date of experience: April 2016,The Big Sheep.,4,"Bideford, United Kingdom"
Fabulous friendly apartments amazing location,"We stayed in a 2 bed apartment with our 2 teenagers in August. We enjoyed our stay so much we have already booked to return next year, something we rarely do as we like seeing different places. When you get off the bus you are directed down a pretty alleyway follow this until you get to the sea then turn right and walk along the road until you get to Hiona. There was plenty of room with 2 bedrooms a separate kitchen/dining area and a balcony with amazing sea views. The apartments are typical Greek style so basic but had everything we needed. The pool area is lovely, just over the road from the sea so has amazing views. It is kept very clean and has plenty of padded sun loungers. There are soft cushioned seats around the bar area some in the shade which was very welcome as it was very hot when we were there. The apartments have air conditioning and a safe which cost 100 euros for the 2 weeks. It is the family who run this place that really make this place so special. Elenni is there during the day and always smiling and happy and her brother Manos does the evening shift. He is extremely helpful and a genuinely likeable person. He gets on with everyone young or old and even managed to get our hormonal teenager smiling! He is really helpful with local information and came up with some great suggestions for places to visit. The food at the apartments was really good and reasonably priced. Elounda itself is a beautiful place and Hiona has an ideal location near the causeway so if you want to eat out or head to the sandy beach turn left as you leave the apartments. It's also really pretty if you walk along a few minutes to the right along the causeway too and there is a small taverna there. There are endless options to eat out in Elounda and we tried as many as we could and never had a bad meal. It is an ideal area for families or couples and the whole area is extremely beautiful. The island of Spinalonga can be seen from the apartments and it's easy to pick up a boat trip from the harbour. An extra bonus is that we didn't see a single mosquito in the 2 weeks we were there. Greek nights are held at Hiona every 2 weeks where there is a BBQ with lots of tasty food and Greek music and dancing around the pool. This was a great night that everyone enjoyed. All in all this is an amazing place where you are made to feel very welcome.",Date of stay: August 2015,Hiona Apartments,4,"Crete, Greece"
Fantastic fun,I bought my husband a flying experience for Christmas. From the minute we walked in the door we were made to feel very welcome. We arrived early and were given a lovely coffee and chatted to whilst we waited. The whole set up is extremely professional and realistic with top quality equipment covering everything from flight training to fear of flying courses and even activity group team building and Cub Scout sessions. We opted for the half hour flight which covered instruction followed by a flight in the simulator. My husband was concentrating so much he barely looked up from the controls to take in what was outside the window! He did say it was extremely realistic and our teenage son is now begging to go and try it too. Our teenagers were made to feel very welcome and part of the experience. I would fully recommend this place to anyone either as an introduction to flying or just a fun day out or experience gift. A very professionally run friendly place.,,Virtual Jet Centre,4,"Chudleigh, United Kingdom"
Theatre trip,We stayed at Rose Court for a theatre break. Its location is perfect right next to Marble Arch on Oxford street. There is an Ncp car park virtually next door but remember to pre book your space here on line. After reading the reviews we weren't expecting a lot but it was really good value for money. We were met on reception with a polite welcome and they were very happy to store our luggage as we were early and give us directions to the theatre. Our room had 3 single beds and plenty of room for one night. The bathroom was clean and everything worked. The breakfast was continental with option of eggs beans and toast included in the price. Yes the room could have done with a lick of paint but it was clean and comfortable. If you want a high class hotel book somewhere more expensive but for a budget break this is ideal.,Date of stay: December 2014,Rose Court Hotel,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Very friendly Ideal location,"These apartments have an ideal location for a holiday in Tsilivi. The owners are extremely friendly and will do their best to sort any problems you may have. They also take the trouble to come and chat with you making you feel very welcome yet managing to do this without intruding on your holiday. We stayed in a 2 bed apartment which was basic but as we don't eat in other than breakfast had everything we needed. The beds were fairly hard and the pillows like rocks but we did get used to them. Our apartment was at the front overlooking the road and unfortunately we were bothered by the load music (Elvis impressions) and loud whistle blowing every night from the Paradise bar. This stopped around 1am and it was peaceful after this. We did have a lovely big balcony and overlooking the road had the advantage of being able to watch the horses and carts etc. passing by. If you have small children with an early bedtime it would be worth asking for a room away from the road. The pool area is lovely and despite being high season we never felt the need to reserve sun beds as there were always enough for our party of 4 to get sunbeds together. There is also free wifi in the pool area if required. There are so many lovely tavernas nearby we tried a different one every day and never had a bad meal. There is a car hire place next door which did a good deal. The beach is only 5 minutes away and there is also a water park which offers reduced entrance price after 2pm about 30 mins walk away or a very short taxi ride. Food is served during the day at the pool bar - if you only try one thing make it their tuna sandwich! It was fabulous and I am still missing them, made with their own olive oil and lemon juice with fresh bread from their friends bakery I have never tasted a sandwich so good. All the food was good and the staff really friendly you can't fail to relax and have a good time here.",Date of stay: August 2014,Razis Apartments,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Great food both in bar and restaurant,Great food in friendly atmosphere. Fabulous sea views from restaurant and outside seating area. Bar meals good value too. Probably the best nachos in whole world!,Date of visit: February 2014,The Beaver Inn,4,"Appledore, United Kingdom"
Nice but could easily be a lot better,"I always try to write reviews that I feel would have help me make a choice when booking accommodation. I would have given this place more stars as ultimately it's nice but felt it would be misleading due to the following factors. We stayed in room one which was on the end of the building. We had had a busy day and were starving when we arrived. I was looking forward to coffee and biscuits to keep us going until dinner which was still several hours away. The room was nice but very small (our friends room looked bigger so maybe room 1 is particularly small) We were given milk to take to our room which had a small amount of basic tea and coffee but no biscuits etc. We closed the blind which promptly fell off the window. It appeared to have been repaired several times with glue on the velcro but was now past the point of jut being stuck up. The bathroom was nice with lights that came on automatically when you open the door - a nice touch in the night when it's dark for finding the light switch. There were two small bottles of shampoo provided and two towels each but no shower gel or flannels etc. some added small touches here would have been nice. The end pannel was hanging off the bath and needed repairing and there was a large black chip in the bath and the same in the toilet seat. The grouting around the shower was mouldy and needed a good clean or possibly regrouting as it was almost past the point of cleaning. The bedroom was nicely furnished but was so small there was no room to pass each other around the bed the furniture was nice and you could tell they had spent money and time making it nice. It was let down by a hole in the bed linnen which really should have been replaced as it was right on the top in the middle so very obvious. There were 2 nice bedside lamps but no overhead light - this combined with the fact there was only one plug on the far side or the room and one mirror on the other side hair drying in the low light was difficult. The view from the window wasn't good as it overlooked a flat roof. This was made worse by the fact it had become a dumping fround for old tables and beer crates. The bed was very comfortable but was two beds pushed together which left a ridge in the middle - fine if you stick to your own side! Bearing in mind how much this place costs for B&B I feel you would expect a lot more than you get. We did struggle to shut the door and were told you had to slam it hard to get the door to lock - it took 2 members of staff to work this out. We did take the opportunity to point out the blind, the broken bath panel and the hole in the bedding and received an apology but nothing more (a change of bedding would have been better). The pub is lovely with a rustic traditional feel and it was very welcoming. The food was good but pricy and the menu very limited - only one vegetarian option so if you don't like mushrooms best to ring ahead, The breakfast was very tasty but our friend ordered eggs and bacon rather than the full english and was given only one rasher of bacon which looked very lonely. All in all it looks like a lot of thought and effort went into making this place really nice but sadly standards have slipped and this has not been kept up to date. For the money they need to add a few finishing touches like shower gel in the bathroom and biscuits with the tea and coffee. Please also tidy up the flat roof that room one overlooks. It wouldn't take a lot to make this place a lot better and train the staff to be more interested when guests point out these things to you as although they said the words sorry we didn't feel like they were very interested.",Date of stay: January 2014,East End Arms,4,"Lymington, United Kingdom"
Beautiful cycle ride,Having now cycled the tarka trail from meeth to braunton in my opinion the section from Torrington to meeth is by far the nicest if least known. It is slightly tougher as uphill from Torrington but nothing too hard. This 9 mile stretch varies from woodland to nature reserves and is very scenic the ground is slightly rougher but still fine to cycle although may get muddy in the winter. There is a cafe at yarde to stop for home baked refreshments or the bull and dragon pub at meeth. The cycle track section of the tarka trail comes to an end at meeth here turn right along a country lane then left on the main road up a short hill and you will quickly be given a warm welcome at the bull and dragon pub. As this is a long cycle ride I would recommend looking up food and opening times before setting off as there isn't an alternative and its up hill back to yarde,Date of experience: September 2013,Tarka Trail (Braunton to Meeth),4,"Devon, United Kingdom"
Fabulous Apartments relaxing and peaceful,We were very pleased with these apartments in Kassiopi. They are traditional Greek style and very peaceful ensuring a good nights sleep. We sayed in a 2 bedroom downstair apartment and had the benefit of the extra space outside with a lovely seating area. There is a small pool which at first glance looks small turned out to be ideal as the water warmed up lovely and as it's a small place no one reserved the sun beds which ensured there was always more than enough to go around. We were there in August with Thomas Cook. The owners are lovely and live on site so are always there if there are any problems and sort them straight away. WiFi is free which pleased our children and air con was 70 euros for 2 weeks for 2 units in the 2 bed apartment. The owners dont speak any English which to us was lovely as we got the chance to practice our own very poor Greek. We were made to feel like one of the family and were very sad to leave. The apartments are in an ideal location just a very short distance from the main harbour and beach area with numerous tavernas to choose from. Kassiopi is a very pretty resort suited best to families and couples. There is a lovely bakery just behind the apartments and a bar/taverna Lekkas just opposite which did fantastic food at very good prices. The children were always given a plate of sweets at the end of the meal and the adults a shot of ~Kum Quat the local drink. Various boat trips are available from the harbour - the sunset crusie was excellent. A trip to the sandy beach at nearby Kalamaki is a must as it has beautiful sand and shallow clear water making it safe for children. You can catch the local bus or the post office did a trip for 4 euros return. All in all a fantastic place if you are looking for a traditional Greek holiday.,Date of stay: August 2013,Andreas Apartments,4,"Corfu, Greece"
