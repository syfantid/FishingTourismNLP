Adventures to secluded beaches, caves and underwater caverns. Jumping from seriously big boulders into perfectly blue waters. Watching the 'catch' reeled in - fascinating and hypnotic! The guys are so accommodating and friendly - I hope this continues to be such a success for you both, K&D.  Thanks for the best day. x‚Ä¶"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/953larsg,July 2019,5,Amazing fishing & boat trip ,"We have had the most beautiful day on this boat. Especially cool was observing the catch  from a 700 m long net. It seems endless. And a lot of different fish and sea foodüòÅ We went to the most outstanding beaches this island had to offer with crystal clear water. So if you do this bring all your snorkeling & swimming gear and of cause your camera... While we were having fun Xristina and Yannis prepared the most delicious meal ever, all from the fresh catch. Now this is an experience you will never forget. My family and me loved it!‚Ä¶"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matteo76va,July 2019,5,What a surprise!,"We have spent a wonderful day with Cristine and her husband: that day we were the only guests and had a sort of private tour. We have assisted them retrieving the fishing net that was positioned the night before and we have been very lucky capturing some very nice fishes!  After some pics to the catched fishes we moved to Fteri where we had the chance to take a bath and also walk on that  extraordinary place. We then had a second stop at the blue lagoon and finally, with perfect timing reached Kamari beach. Another long bath, some sun on the beach...a nice talk with Christina before getting back on the boat for a really delicius lunch: an aragosta and a big seabream have been grilled together with other smaller but tasty fishes .   The tour is definitely highly recommended, on the boat the atmosphere was friendly and relaxed. Landscapes, beaches and water just impossible to describe. If you are in Kefalonia do not miss it!‚Ä¶"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/astellmann,June 2019,5,A wonderful boat trip day. I recommend. ,"It was an incredible day with my family in the Greek blue waters. We went out to fish, enjoy, swim and eat. It was a cozy day, the owners Cristina and her husband are very friendly and they work hard to make to you a wonderful day. We start the day visiting some nice hidden places in the cost, like the cave in the pictures, to after that start to collect the fishing net with what would be our delicious and health fresh fish for lunch. After this we went to Fteri and other  beachs around and during our time in the water and beach, the captain and Cristina started to prepare our meal, as you can see in the pictures too. When we return to the boat we found a delightful table with grilled fresh fishes, lobsters, fresh salad, of course with Kefalonias olive oil, bread and local white wine. I not able to find enought words to describe how nice was the boat trip. My son (10 years old) loved everything. Christina and her Husband are starting this business and I will recommend this to everyone I know. If you want to enjoy a quite nice and simple boat trip with good food and without all this fancy things, laud music, lot of people around you, this is the right boat trip to go. We recommend. ‚Ä¶"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malmarita,May 2019,5,The most beautiful day of my life from beginning to end <3,"I will never forget the day 23rd of May 2019 that I spent on a fishing tour with a traditional Greek fishing boat along the turquoise waters of the Ionian Sea around Zola. This  was the most beautiful day in my life <3   I watched with delight the beaches available only from the sea: Amidi Beach, Fteri Beach, Kamari Beach, Kamari Caves and Blue Lagoon where we stayed for a lunch of the caught fishes and swimming. Xristina Karousou, Dionushs Gasparatos, Thaleia Stelatou and Christos Stelatous from Kefalonia Diving Center are so wonderful people, very friendly hosts, talented fishermen and even better cooks!   It was a real feast, lobsters, squid, several species of fried fish, wonderful Greek salad, even better cooked potatoes with vegetables, home-made cake and wine, fruits with cinnamon and honey... Everything tasted delicious in such a breathtaking surroundings that I have always dreamed of.  From the bottom of my heart I am thankful for paricipation <3   Highly recommend this trip! Very safe! Excellent!‚Ä¶"
