Highly Recommend,"I can’t say enough about this amazing evening!!! Hands down the best lobster I have ever had in Greece.
So, I own a small group of vacation properties on the island. I have always heard amazing reviews of Michali’s Fishing Boat from my guests and decided to give it it a try with a group of friends from the island.
I am so happy I did.
I highly recommend this to everyone. You will not be disappointed. Andonia and Michalis catered to our every need. Professional courteous and went above and beyond to make our evening cruise memorable. Thank you Andonia and Michalis!",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great Food & Service,I was pleasantly surprised. We were in the mood for a classic American Style Cheeseburger. Wynwood did not disappoint. The burger was juicy and cooked exactly as ordered. The service was amazing. Staff friendly and attentive. Great spot to hang out and enjoy good food and ice cold beers.,Date of visit: September 2018,Wynwood - Eat Sip & Gather the Miami Style,5,"Glyfada, Greece"
