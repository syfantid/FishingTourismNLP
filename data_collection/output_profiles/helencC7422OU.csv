❤❤❤❤❤,"Would highly recommend this boat trip, we were welcomed by George and Petros with a huge hug before we even stepped on the boat and from the off it was nothing but laughs. We set off at 9am and stopped off at white rocks bay, stunning scenery, crystal clear waters so just had to jump off the boat! For the not so daring or strong swimmers, they could hitch a ride in the motorised dinghy to shore; nothing was too much trouble. After about 1 hour we got back on board and set sail to Rabbit Island, on route we were served some wonderful food made by George and Petros' mama, the chicken was to die for, so tender, and we also had rice, peppers, stuffed vine leaves, and a lot more (I won't reveal everything foodwise, you need to find out for yourself)! We explored rabbit island so don't forget your sea shoes as you definitely need these. Our third and final stop was XI Beach where again you could either swim from the boat or catch a lift in the dinghy. Here you could grab clay from the cliff face and give yourself a bit of mud clay exfoliation. We were also served cold frappe on the beach too. Back on board we set sail back to Argostoli arriving back at 5pm. So, a good full day of fun and laughter was had by all on board; free flowing wine all day and soft drinks for the teetotals; nothing was too much trouble. I would definitely recommend this trip you won't be disappointed. We are back on Kefalonia next year so will be booking once more. Thank you both George and Petros for helping us make many more memories on this beautiful island. See you in 2020 xxx",Date of experience: September 2019,Kefalonia Trips QueenBee,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
❤❤❤❤❤,"So, 3rd time for us on this wonderful day trip on a working fishing boat. We were welcomed aboard with greek coffee and homemade vanilla cake, Mmmmm. Then, we set sail at 8am to gather the nets that were set the night before. Magda (hope I've spelt it right) reeled in the nets. We caught copious amounts of varieties of fish which were then cooked for us on board whilst we stopped off in a beautiful bay for a jump off the boat into crystal clear waters. Once back on board we enjoyed a starter of bruschetta then onto the fish feast with a massive pan of freshly cooked spaghetti. We were also given wine (grape juice ) and water whenever we needed. Captain Michalis and Antonia were magnificent hosts as always and couldn't have done anymore for us. Once we had eaten we had time for more swimming then set off back to the harbour for 4pm. All in all it was an amazing day as ever and we are back in june and sept 2020 so we shall be booking again. Thank you thank you thank you for another unforgettable day where amazing memories were created once again. Love to you all I would highly recommend booking this trip you won't be disappointed xx",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Beautiful place / friendly helpful staff,"We have stayed at Astra Village in Sept 2018 and May 2019 and absolutely love the place, so much so we booked for 17 nights in Sept 2020 whilst we were sitting in their bar in May. We are also booked to go back in June 2020 so I'm sure that tells you how much we love it there. It is very central to all bars and tavernas in Svoronata. There is a bus stop 10 mins down the road which is right by Ammes beach. Back to The Astra Village, the bar area is so chilled with a beautiful outdoor area with proper comfy seating and Chris & Alex the bar staff couldn't be more helpful, they looked after us very well. The pool area is huge and you can see the planes take off/land from the poolside. Don't worry about being so close to the airport (5 min drive away) as you hear and see the planes coming in to land / take off but it doesnt detract from the peace and tranquility of the place as they become second nature and they don't fly at night, you'll actually find yourself watching every take off and landing time after time everytime you hear the rumble of the engines starting up. The breakfast area is beautifully laid every morning with a huge selection to choose from which suits everyone, this also doubles as Elias Restaurant in the evening with beautifully made tables. Rooms are also big enough with some having a walk in shower and others having a shower over the bath, all kept spotlessly clean by the team of hardworking cleaners. Anna on reception is absolutely lovely and is always happy to help with any queries we may have. Irene is another beautiful lady who couldn't do enough to help if we asked. I know I have waffled but I could go on an on how much we love staying at The Astra. I, my husband and two friends we go with wouldn't stay anywhere else hence our 2020 bookings. At the time of writing, 11 weeks on Sat until we see everyone again and very much looking forward to catching up, they aren't just staff they are now friends for life. I would highly recommend booking your hol here whether it be couples, families or even on your own from 1 night to 21 nights or longer. Very cheesy but we The Astra Village Hotel and Suites. Book now to guarantee a beautiful stay as this place is so popular it books up so quickly xxx",Date of stay: May 2019,Astra Village Hotel & Suites,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
A trip not to be missed!!!,"Well where do I start, this was our 2nd trip on this working fishing boat trip. We were greeted by Antonia who is the most wonderful host offering home made cake and greek coffee before we set off. Michalis takes the helm and off we go. We go to collect the nets that had been set the night before and Hassan works tirelessly bringing then in whilst we watch in wonder at what has been caught; lobsters, barrachudas, stingray (that went back to the sea), numerous varieties of fish (obviously ) then a beautiful meal was prepared by Antonia and lobster spaghetti by Michalis with plenty of 'grape' juice galore (that's white wine btw). We anchored in a lovely little bay whilst we ate and drank. Swimming and jumping off the boat whilst anchored is a must do but the sea was a tad chilly at this time of year but a couple of guests did partake. This is a trip that must be booked and not to be missed - highly recommended. Ps don't have breakfast beforehand you won't need it! We have already booked our 3rd trip for Sept so roll on 16 weeks. THANK YOU Antonia, Michalis and Hassan for another day of creating fantastic memories. Love to you all. Until Sept..... ️️",Date of experience: May 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
a truly unforgettable day,"2nd review as 1st one lost!
My husband and 2 friends had the pleasure of going on this trip on Mon 3rd Sept. Antonia and Michalis were fabulous hosts from the moment we stepped on board and I hold a lot of memories from this day. We had a lot of laughs with the other guests and also when I took a 'dive' 1 intentional and the other not so intentional but the memories will last a lifetime. I loved splashing about in the water with Niki who is an absolute credit to you both. This is a trip on a working fishing boat and Antonia & Michalis prepped some of the days' catch reeled in on 3km of net by Hassain, for a lovely feast. We stopped off for a swim in the crystal waters whilst food was prepped. I would highly recommend this trip. to you all and THANK YOU again for the memories. Will definitely visit again when we return to Svoronata. love Helen and Steve Clayton xx",Date of experience: September 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
