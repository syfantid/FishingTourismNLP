Thoroughly enjoyable trip.,"Wanted a boat trip, to see some sights, do some swimming around the caves. Booked last minute and went out. The fishing was fun, we didn‚Äôt really want to do the fishing - but when we started we couldn‚Äôt stop. So much fun and we all caught a few fish!
The caves swim was nice - they provided snorkelling gear, life jackets etc - but we didn‚Äôt bring our swimming shoes so couldn‚Äôt climb up on the rocks.
The BEST part was lunch. It was excellent! fresh fish, Greek salad, bread and watermelon. The pictures speak for themselves.
This trip is definitely worth a go.",Date of experience: July 2020,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"

Well done ladies!",Date of stay: January 2018,Babette Guldsmeden - Guldsmeden Hotels,1,"Copenhagen, Denmark"
Finishing touches required to make it great.,"Just back from 2 weeks.

Good points.
- The hotel is in a great place, 15 min walk from the local town along a nice beach front promenade.
- Pools are great with lots of choice depending on the age of your party (activity with slides, kiddies, family with water polo or relax pool)
- good level of daily activities for kids and adults (volleyball, football, water aerobics etc)
- food generally good - good selection but gets busy at times -try the downstairs dining room with larger patio if you want to get away from the crowds.
- rooms modern and family room I had was very spacious. (Definitely ask for a sea view otherwise you could be looking at a wall)
- entertainment team try hard and do a good job.
- bar staff and restaurant staff excellent. A few words in Croatian go along way :)
- good selection of drinks and cocktails - Lana at Relax pool makes the best Pina Colada ! Team at Reception bar are always busy and cheery in the evenings till 11. Well done.
- good choice of TV channels.
- beaches are nice, clean but stony. Take some aqua shoes to make walking in out of the sea so much easier. Water crystal clear so take your goggles to see the fish!

Points to note.
- on the way back to the airport, if travelling with small children take a spare plastic sick bag. 1 hour of winding roads, The lady behind me was wearing her sons breakfast at the end of the journey.
- hotel needs some safety improvements around the relax pool. Slopes and steps need better marking. Trip hazards (wiring), not enough slip mats around the bar.
- DANGER - relax pool downstairs toilet is an ice rink when wet. Last step slopes downwards. No handrail. Father fell and needed 7 stitches in local hospital.
- it's a hilly resort so get used to where the lifts are (1 lift down the side of the gift shop to main reception) 2 lifts towards main restaurant) if you don't want to be doing too many stairs.
- Taverna (1 visit per week) was very nice change - but they would benefit from rotating the menu per week - same food on both visits was disappointing.
- wasps need controlling.

So if they fix a few things this will be an even better place to visit.",Date of stay: July 2017,TUI Blue Bellevue Resort,1,"Rabac, Croatia"
