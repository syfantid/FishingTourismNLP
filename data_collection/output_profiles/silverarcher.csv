Totally Unique,Recently we visited The blue House Art Gallery to buy something for our wedding anniversary. Areti was wonderful as always giving a unique shopping experience as each piece is so personal to her. I think we may have been her first customers this season and hopefully even with all the worldwide problems it will be a successful one. I cannot recommend this shop enough a must visit when in Skiathos.,Date of experience: June 2020,The Blue House Art Gallery,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Idyllic place to eat with fantastic food,"I can't think of a more perfect place to sit and enjoy fabulous Greek food. My husband and I have been eating at this taverna for over 25 years and always enjoy the friendly attentive staff, great atmosphere and delicious food. If you visit Skiathos you must come here!",Date of visit: March 2019,Kabourelias Ouzeri-Tavern,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Great morning's fishing,"This was my 3rd and most successful fishing trip with Dimitris. Every time is a pleasure as Dimitris is great company and really knows how to find a good catch. Spent the morning trolling around Tsgouria island catching many tuna which we later barbecued at home and also caught a small swordfish which was duly released to fight another day!

All in all cannot recommend Dimitris enough. Great guy and great day out!",Date of experience: September 2018,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Wonderful Food Experience,We have been visiting Lo & La in Skiathos for years now and yet they still surprise us! Our latest visit last week was wonderful with new dishes on the menu and new experience in kitchen. The service was as always the most welcome and the dishes we shared were some of the most delicious we have had for a while. We will definitely be visiting again over this summer.,Date of visit: April 2016,Lo&La,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Great local pub and a warm welcome to everyone...,"I really enjoy my regular visits to The Royal Union, a friendly, traditional and what I would call a 'proper' back street pub which stands out in a time when everything is a chain of some sort. The owners are really accommodating and the staff and regular local faces have always been really chatty and friendly which only enhances a great atmosphere. You will be lucky to find a selection of real ales as good as the Unions anywhere else in Cheltenham and the menu is creative in providing 'sharing' meals as well as the usual fayre.",Date of visit: May 2015,Royal Union Inn,4,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom"
Lo & La is the perfect package.....,"Lo & La in Skiathos town ticks all the boxes.
Venue, Food and especially staff. As regular visitors to the island we have tried many restuarants around the island and have found this one to be one of the very best. The food is so fresh and tasty with the best ingredients cooked with passion and served with grace. How they produce such generous portions of fresh, beautiful food on the prices they charge is beyond me? I think on our last visit out of 11 nights we ate there 8 times? as there was so much on the menu we wanted to try even though we have visited it many times before - we cannot recommend it enough - make sure you visit if in Skiathos - word of warning..... beware of the desserts they will make you feel very naughty!!!!",Date of visit: April 2011,Lo&La,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
