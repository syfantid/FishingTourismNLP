Sniffer’s 50th!,"Well, what can I say, came with 13 mates, booked with George a while back, and we had a brilliant day!! Great fun, swimming, great hosts, and the lunch/ wine etc was lovely! Caught some fish too, and had a swim with a turtle! Great thanks to George, his mum in law, and other crew, a great day!",Date of experience: June 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Tony ardley,"Well, what can I say, paradise! A mountain view back drop, olive groves one side and vines the other. We all had a fantastic time, lovely food and drinks, clean tidy villa, with great showers and furnishings. Gary and Lesley looked after us fantastically, and we have booked to come back later this year, as we all had such a great time. 10 minutes walk to the beach, and 5 mins from the village of alykanas, so perfect location, and away far enough from the bars, so your not disturbed at night. Couldn’t recommend zante garden highly enough.",Date of stay: July 2018,Zantegarden Apartments,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
