2nd visit,"We love this place... Chose it specifically for this years trip as the owners and family can’t do enough for you.
The housekeepers tend to your rooms everyday changing the bins and stocking up the toilet roll and basic clean around-we’d only been here 2 days and our sheets were changed. The rooms are sufficient for our holiday and clean, but other than comfy beds and a shower what more would you need?
Spiros speaks English very well and nothing is too much trouble for him or any one else here.
The supermarket is well stocked and well priced compared to others in the area.

All they expect from us as guests is to not eat food from the supermarket by the pool as local checks can cause them a huge fine under Greek law.

The bar snacks available are tasty and cooked quickly. Their breakfast choices too suits any appetite.

Wouldn’t hesitate to book here again next time in Zante.",Date of stay: August 2019,Elpida Hotel,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Highly recommend,"Booked this through PM on facebook and communication was swift & informative. Didn’t want the usual boat trips available and this sounded exactly what we were looking for. I was messaged the evening before that there would be a later start with apologies. It was only 30 mins & caused no concerns to us. We arrived earlier than expected and was invited straight away into the boat. Giorgos was a very friendly captain and immediately made everyone feel at home as soon as we stepped on to his boat. It was amazingly clean for a fishing boat and we were immediately offered Greek coffee’s to wake us up. He kept us up to date as others were delayed arriving (his English is brilliant). We still left earlier than he had messaged me the night before.
He explained to us all how the nets work and some history as we were passing by the island.
When they started to cast the nets it’s very hypnotic and hard not to study the technique used. He encouraged the other guests to try too... It takes about 20mins - nearly a KM in length will not be quick! No one was bored during this time it’s entrancing and the strangers on board started to become companions.. we went for a lovely swim at a secluded spot called Pelouzo Island. Giorgos explained the history of the island and also that the marine conservation & WWF had a part in the island too (very encouraging info) that he is also a member of.
We moved after a couple of hours to collect up the nets. This was great to watch aswell... We went off for another swim in deeper waters with the snorkels that he’d provided. Giorgos explained to a few of us his catches and what’s available and when-his aim for today was red mullet I loved the snorkelling-never done it before... i eventually got called back to the boat
Dinner was ready.
It looked incredible!
Never tried so many different fish sea bream; mackerel even a cuttlefish to name few. Along with his home made wine available and the wonderful food we all got to know the others on board from different countries on their holiday and conversations were flowing.
I can’t say enough about this trip, it was perfect from start to finish, you never went hungry and always had cold drinks offered. This was exactly what we’d been looking for and more! Don’t hesitate to book with 12 max on board it really is a welcoming personal experience to remember.",Date of experience: August 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Overnight stay,"Just one night stay as attending local wedding with my 11yo daughter. The communication via email during booking procedures was excellent. Had no problems checking in after the wedding and before the evening reception.
The hosts were lovely and even checked with me i was happy in a double room having to sleep with my daughter (which i was). The room was lovely and clean and plenty of coffee & tea supplies in the room with a complimentary kitkat.
We came back late and fell into bed and it was really, really comfortable. The pair of us had a wonderful nights sleep. Breakfast was served from 07:30 until 08:30 and we came downstairs about 08:15, we were told we could arrive for breakfast at 08:30 and still get served and relax before check out at 10am. The breakfast was divine and nothing was too much trouble for them. My daughter loved the tea that they made.
The en-suite was small but nothing negative there either, lovely shower and again, complimentary shower/shampoo wash available if you’d forgotten your own. Lovely soft towels available as well. Definitely a lovely, quiet relaxing place to stay and wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again if i was in the area.
Thank you to the lovely hosts for looking after us.",Date of stay: July 2019,The Golden Lion Hotel,1,"Llandysilio, United Kingdom"
Best breakfast in area,Came here on a whim as have been several times before for their breakfasts. Loads of choice to suit all appetites and great value for money. A small locally run cafe with enough seating area. also serve loads of variety for sandwiches to eat in or takeaway. I always come here when i fancy a cooked breakfast and on rare occasions collect a sandwich for my lunch at work (and a slice of cake) The food is always fresh and their coffees are heaven. Staff are friendly and can accommodate all dietary requirements from what i’ve seen. Don’t pass them by go in and see for yourself.,Date of visit: July 2019,The Rainbow Tree,1,"Leicester, United Kingdom"
Raffle Prize,"Pumpkins Deli kindly donated 2 breakfasts as a Christmas Raffle prize towards money raised to a great charity within our company. As we’re based in the surrounding area our office had used them for our lunches on numerous occasions and have never been disappointed, so i was thrilled that i’d won.
Travelled out of my home town with my other half and raved about this place to him on route. The place was full when we arrived, but a lovely, polite member of staff told us a couple had eaten and were just finishing their drinks and we shouldn’t have that long to wait (Good service right there).
When we got a table we ordered our breakfasts, enough choices for all size of pallet. I had a cappuccino too and i’ve got to say it was one of the nicest i’ve had in a long time-far nicer than that particular brand you see everywhere.
The full english breakfast we’d ordered was amazing! Cooked to perfection and really tasty.
For me on first impression was it actually didn’t look ‘daunting’ like other breakfasts i’ve had, as in, seeing all the grease and thinking how ‘unhealthy’ it was. This was fresh, local produce and enjoyable to eat. The granary toast with it was nice too.

I have nothing negative to say about our visit at all. Great atmosphere, lovely staff and plenty of menu choices. For a local village deli this is a really popular place and well done to the owners for making this place what it is. A real unexpected gem in a small village in the middle of the countryside.",Date of visit: January 2019,Pumpkins Deli,1,"Brinklow, United Kingdom"
Spooky trail,"A large group of us all met up for the spooky trail, all with children of various ages-from 18 months to 10 years of age. It’s my first visit, so I didn’t know what to expect.
They all had great fun following the map to find the clues, they stopped for ages to feed the ducks and signets with the food you could buy (£1) from the shop.
There was no rush for any of us and during the trail the kids had a great time climbing and playing on the logs that were everywhere. The play area (in the middle of the trail somewhere) was brilliant fun with all the ropes and challenges. Saw lots of adults give it a go too.
There were a lot of dog walkers around, every dog was on a lead which was good too and I wish I’d have brought mine along.
It’s a terrific place to get your kids out in the fresh air and just play.
A really nice cafe, that looked like it would allow your dog inside and plenty of seating areas dotted around the trail. There’s also a coffee stand over on the right past the griffin steps to warm you up, if you don’t want to visit the cafe. Nice coffee and reasonably priced.
Highly recommend this for a visit.
The car parking was £3 all day for the spooky trail and everyone had a fabulous afternoon.
Will definitely be going again, even without the spooky trail.",Date of experience: October 2018,Coombe Abbey Park,1,"Coventry, United Kingdom"
Almost enchanted place...,"Spotted this en-route to another local interest and decided to visit on our way back.
So glad we did, it really is a wonderful place to visit. As mentioned in another review your imagination could run with this place... so easy to see why a few film crews have chosen this place. It’s enchanting and my 10yo said it was magical. The natural wooden hand rails for the stepping stones to balance with fitted in well and were smooth through use. Loads of photo opportunities just for the setting. Good sturdy footwear is needed as some parts could get slippy if it’s been raining and a steady balance is required on the rare occasions.
Entrance fee was £13 for me & my daughter, at first I thought it was a bit expensive to see what I could only describe as a woodland-but while wandering around and seeing the whole area it is very reasonably priced.
Glad to have stumbled upon this place as a nice leisurely walk (and seating provided along the paths) and easily spent over 3 hours here. Could have been so much longer.",Date of experience: August 2018,Puzzlewood,1,"Coleford, United Kingdom"
Interesting place to visit.,"Lots of interesting facts to read while walking around and hard to imagine that several 6yo’s spent over 10 hours a day working down here.
The sound activation was good as you approached a particular place giving you more of insight into what it was like back in the day.
The place was quiet as we wandered around and actually took us no more than 45 minutes, and this was stopping and reading every sign and taking our time.
We missed the semi-depth cave exploring (£20 adults £15 children) as this is planned daily-which would have been really interesting as well and it did say allow 2/3 hours for this. Maybe another day...",Date of experience: August 2018,Clearwell Caves,1,"Coleford, United Kingdom"
Clean beach,"This beach goes on for what seems like miles. We sat down on the beach to relax and the sand is really fine (like abroad) lovely and clean too.
Only down side is no chance of a paddle in the sea, if you want to have a paddle and fancy a ‘hike’ you’d have to go through what can only be described as mud... guessing nature here does have it’s downfall and can’t see how this can be improved.
Buckets and spades are available in the shops so small kids could be amused on the sand for hours.
Overall a really nice sandy beach.",Date of experience: July 2018,Weston-Super-Mare Beach,1,"Weston super Mare, United Kingdom"
Quick bite and caffeine hit,"My Mum had eat here before and fancied some chips and a cappuccino.
Looked a really nice place and was busy with plenty of seating outside.
Service was quick and friendly and the cappuccino’s were lovely as were the chips-big fat ones too. Mum was disappointed as last time she came the chips tasted home made, but she still finished off the bowl and we both enjoyed them and really tasty.
I’d recommend going here rather than any others along the beachfront as there are loads of choices to suit every appetite.",Date of visit: July 2018,Victorian cafe,1,"Weston super Mare, United Kingdom"
Quick visit,"After paying the £1 for each of us just to get on the pier we took a nice steady walk along to the end.
Loads of arcade games and a couple of levels. Definitely a good place to visit if it’s raining and could stay in for hours.
As it was sunny we only wandered around and didn’t bother with any of the games or attractions inside. I can see this costing a fortune if you were here all day-though they were advertising that all day would cost a child £14.99 for a wristband to get on the rides.
Didn’t venture up the stairs so no idea what was available for the kids specifically.
As mentioned before it was only a short visit as didn’t want to miss out on a sunny day.",Date of experience: July 2018,Grand Pier,1,"Weston super Mare, United Kingdom"
Tasty food,"We chose here as it was next to were we had parked and as a chain we knew what to expect.
We were lucky and sat down straight away as not busy and chose our preferred seating place. Lovely decor and fit the location well.
My 10yo has the kids menu and everything was wolfed down by her - great value and 3 courses for £7.95.
Us adults had a classic based pizza each with coleslaw and chips (nice dip too, think it was honey & mustard). Really tasty and filling. Was pleased that they served a de-caff cappuccino as well.
The place got really busy as we were eating and the servers were really busy and they were also going around while serving clearing the tables. The place was clean (as were the toilets).
Our server was really busy (think they must have allocated tables) but he was attentive and made sure we were looked after.
Glad we chose to come here before our long drive home.
Would recommend this place, yes it can be considered expensive for a pizza, but all the food we had was tasty and full of flavour so it was nice to treat my Mum to a ‘posh’ pizza.",Date of visit: July 2018,Pizza Express,1,"Weston super Mare, United Kingdom"
Actually got lost 🤔😂,"Went with my 10yo today-quite late in the afternoon and decided to follow the summer trail... we kept getting lost, no idea how or why... didn’t ruin it at all though we had a really good walk through for over a couple of hours. Really nice walks and good tracks to follow. Loads to see and maps everywhere so you don’t get lost but to be honest we were both having loads of fun just wandering along. Stumbled across the Guffalo trail too. Plenty of photo opportunities.
The ice cream was lovely to set off with and the car park charge of £3 for 2 hours was reasonable (just made it back in time).",Date of experience: July 2018,Queenswood Country Park and Arboretum,1,"Leominster, United Kingdom"
Overnight,"We just needed somewhere to stay overnight due to local celebrations.
So literally put our overnight bag in the room and waited for a taxi. The room & bathroom were really clean, fresh and modern furnished. We were shown the breakfast arrangements - self service (cereal, toast marmalade etc with microwave and a fridge) on the landing.
The bed was really comfortable to sleep in and the shower was powerful.
The WiFi has a strong signal as well.
A real gem and beautifully set out in the countryside with lovely views out of the windows.
Highly recommend this as a place to stay.",Date of stay: June 2018,Victoria Farm,1,"Lutterworth, United Kingdom"
Spa day,"Imposing place when you first arrive and plenty of parking spaces.
Came for a spa day with my friend.
Reception staff were very informative and happy to show us around.
We chose to get a coffee & pastry and sit on the patio area overlooking the beginning of the golf course, first before heading to the gym and spa. The service was slow and a couple of groups of golfers were also waiting, this wasn’t the fault of the staff - it was obvious not enough staff were detailed to cover the area at that particular time of our visit.
The changing rooms were set out well and plenty of space.
We headed to the gym, which on a really hot day, was fabulously air conditioned and cool. Well set out equipment to meet every exercise.
The spa area was very ambient and relaxing and the pool a lovely shade of relaxing blue with loads of lounges around. It was very quiet and the steam & sauna room were empty which was lovely for us to chat inside and catch up while relaxing.
It didn’t seem to have as much around the pool as other spa places I’ve been too though this didn’t by any means impact on the relaxation.
The treatments were divine and the room set out was an instant relaxed environment. Loved the loungers in the room before & after the treatment.
A terrific day spent there and left suitably refreshed.",,Telford Hotel & Golf Resort,1,"Telford, United Kingdom"
Fabulous,"There isn’t anything about this place that hasn’t already been said.
The room we had was basic but furnished well.
2 pools for use 1 located next to bar and the other round the side was quieter.
Only bug to bare was our room was next to the bar and couldn’t sleep till late every night with the entertainment going on which always sounded like everyone was having a terrific time be it karaoke, some crooner singing or just loads of people of having a fab time.
We did go to the BBQ/Greek night and that was brilliant, lots of ‘volunteers’ needed and many willing participants to entertain everyone there and the food was terrific with plenty to go round. Couldn’t fault it. Definitely recommend you attend this if you don’t do anything else. For €8pp brilliant value.",Date of stay: May 2018,Danny's Hotel,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Loads on your plate,"Wasn’t disappointed the food was excellent and lots of it on your plate for The heartiest appetite.
We both had the chicken on the spit (basically half a chicken each) and nice side salad and chips with great tasting tzatziki. Approx €7/8.
Really tasty food and worth visiting here if you don’t want anything that you have to pay above the odds for just to have some food. Quick service and attentive staff.

We originally chose our own table but moved as I could see the bathroom, they moved the table after I explained why to another spot which I thought was good of them.

Great spot to watch the world go by as you finish your beer.",Date of visit: May 2018,Bekiris Family Grill House,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Pool/Beach bar,"Love this place.
The choice of food is spot on for a day at the beach - full English breakfast inc coffee or tea & juice €8 certainly sets you up for the day.
Their Meze €10 for 2 people that we had the first day of arrival was perfect and could choose an English sausage (but why would you? Go Greek! )
The butler service does the place proud for such young lads and they all had their character and spoke English really well.
We’ve been here everyday of our holiday so far and we will do for the rest of it.
The charge for the sun loungers on the beach with umbrella is €7 and we get full use of the pool and showers here, though we didn’t use either.
It’s easy to find -just head to the beach and look for the orange umbrellas.
Highly recommend using this place during your holiday here.",Date of stay: May 2018,Valais Hotel,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Lovely unusual shop,"Found this on TripAdvisor and thought it would be nice for us to visit while here in Blackpool. Was a trek from where we were staying but worth it. The shop had loads of unusual items inside.
The 'magic' with the wands had my daughter drawn in ""you don't choose the wand, the wand chooses you"".
The woman in the shop was very knowledgeable of every item (which you'd expect) and also helped my daughter to 'allow' the wand to choose her.
Lots of unusual trinkets that had just a little bit of magic thrown in.
We spent almost an hour looking around and it's a small shop.
Definitely worth a visit.",Date of experience: August 2017,The Magic Wand Factory,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
Excellent visit,"Bought the tickets online and every single thing was a delight.
The Tower as you'd expect is full of history and lovely to walk around. Each floor had something different and everyone working there always had the time & knowledge to answer any questions.
Visiting the Tower is definitely a must do when in Blackpool and buying online in advance for tickets allows you to plan your visit.",Date of experience: August 2017,The Blackpool Tower,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
Great value,"Used the tram as such a long walk from one end to the other.
The ticket master advised us to get a day ticket £11 for 2 adults/1 child as it was cheaper than the one way planned (£5.50) as they don't do returns when we first got on and we could hop on & off the tram as many times as we wanted within the 24hrs, which was really good as we did throughout the day.",Date of experience: August 2017,Blackpool Tramway,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
Nostalgic,"When we first entered the whole place took our breath away. The place is just beautiful.
The whole family being 'Strictly' fans we just had to visit!
Tea & coffee was reasonably priced - saw that the afternoon tea was £50 for 2; didn't have one, but from what I saw you had plenty of sandwiches & cakes so a lovely treat for someone special.
Lots of couples dancing of all ages and there was even a 'barn dance' style opportunity for the non-ballroom dances out there i.e. Me & my other half... we had a go; you just couldn't being a such a wonderful place.
My daughter loved watching the couples and there may have been some retired professionals on the floor as well!
I was itching to see how 'springy' the dance floor was (after it being mentioned frequently on 'Strictly') and was disappointed as felt like it wasn't to me.
Asked one of the employees and they said it was in some spots under the floor and every year before the big competitions/events and Strictly they fix the springs so it's all through the whole dance floor.
Now you know.",Date of experience: August 2017,Blackpool Tower Ballroom,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
Highly recommend,"Last evening here and must admit sorry to leave. Martin (and his son) are both genuine guys and nothing is too much trouble for either of them.
The place has a lovely relaxed way about it and very welcoming the minute you walk inside.
I'm also sure neither of them would invade your privacy if you're not the chatty kind and wouldn't mind in the slightest, a pleasant 'good morning' and 'hello' is all that's needed as any polite guest would.
The family room we booked was the perfect size for us and the beds are heaven to sleep in (my daughter is a restless sleeper and even she commented on how comfy her bed was).
Martin kept the coffee and milk topped up during our stay and gave us fresh towels when they were needed.
The room was lovely and clean (as is the whole place!).
There was an opportunity to look inside all the other rooms too and every single room was tastefully decorated and very clean, with equally comfy beds & From what we could see all were en-suite.
Location is enough away from the hustle & bustle and there is a carpark at the end of the road if you can't get in a space outside.

No breakfast offered but Martin's girlfriend (who offered hot chocolate sachets to my daughter for her bedtime) recommended a cafe just around the corner which was terrific.

Wouldn't hesitate to return here again. They do say it's the people that make your stay and this is very true here.",Date of stay: August 2017,Oban House Hotel,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
Closed off,"Looks like they're setting up for a concert of some description close by and for the 4 days we were here we couldn't read any of the quotes as it was closed off-which is a shame.
We went up to the Tower eye and took a look and it looks huge!
Shame as it would have been nice to have read some and remember some of the great comedy quotes.",Date of experience: August 2017,Comedy Carpet,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
Excellent breakfast value for money,"We came here as suggested by our hotel.
Fabulous breakfasts. My daughter couldn't stop raving about her bacon and sausage ""barm"". Great value. Lots of choice for all sorts of breakfast, i.e. scrambled egg on toast. Pretty much anything you want to suit all appetites.
Lovely and clean place, large seating area.
Real gem of a place away from the sea front and we'll definitely be coming here every morning during our stay in (actually) sunny Blackpool.",Date of visit: August 2017,Cafe Rendezvous,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
Thoroughly enjoyable,"My daughter and I were very apprehensive about coming in.
Though we did laugh more than get scared. The live actors were brilliant, thought anyone with small kids it isn't anything like we expected (a haunted house atmosphere where the actors jump out) there are a few jumpy moments but more of a giggle at your own silliness than anything else.
My daughter (9yo) wants to go around again. It was also very informative about torture instruments and local superstitions and history (bit like horrible histories).
Bought tickets as part of the Blackpool tower package so good value for money.",Date of experience: August 2017,The Blackpool Tower Dungeon,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
Informative,"Went with my mum & daughter, decided at the last minute to join the guided tour with an ex-officer (Graham with 34 years experience). The tour was really interesting and Graham's knowledge of the history right through until they closed it down was interesting to hear - from his own experience on the landings and relaying stories of prisoners that he'd dealt with, to way back with his knowledge of the history of the building including when they were hanging the prisoners.
You really got a good idea of how it was on the inside for him as an officer dealing with the 300 prisoners along with 7 other staff.
Which many people don't realise or probably no real concept (unless of course you have served 'time').
He explained the procedures for the prisoners from the moment they arrived in the reception area to the last day they were there leaving the gate, he relayed this with first hand experience and great explanation of the problems they could go inside with and what he could (and did) have to deal with on a daily basis.
My greatest respect to him.
Thank you to Graham-it was a privilege to have met you.

Definitely a worthwhile visit.",Date of experience: July 2017,Shrewsbury Prison,1,"Shrewsbury, United Kingdom"
"De Montford Hall, Leicester","Ok. So I went solo. Reason? Birthday treat and OH more into rock/metal music than a night at the theatre watching a romance.
I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was sat too far away to see the actual acting and expressions but having seen the movie a 100 times plus I could almost quote it so didn't feel cheated in anyway.
There were some scenes in the stage show that aren't in the film but it all ties together and relevant to the background era.
The different stage scenes/sets were cleverly and subtly done.
Johnny on stage portrayed the character as a near copy as Patrick Swayze did in the film and it worked well (in my opinion Swayze was Johnny so it was a tough act to follow) and the actor on stage: Lewis Griffiths did it very well. I overheard one woman close to me say he sounds just like him and her friend agreed.
Every main character played their part, as in the film, as it should be.
Though to me, Neil Kellerman was funny and played on the cheesy character in a comical way-kind of liked him in the stage show (thought he was a real sleaze ball in the film).
All the dancing was high energy and great to watch, I found myself awe of it and shuffling my feet to the tunes-some recorded and some live singing to a few of the tunes which was terrific to hear.
It was a fantastic show and reflected the feelings of the film to the stage brilliantly.
I have no idea why it has had bad reviews on here, unless the production read them and sorted out the mishaps.
The iconic ""nobody puts baby in the corner"" had the audience with bated breath waiting, knowing it was coming, I could feel the anticipation building around me.
As for the lift! Wow!
A stage show not to be missed for fans of the film. Half the audience gave it a standing ovation, me included.",Date of experience: April 2017,Musical Dirty Dancing,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Daughter & friend treat,"Restaurant wasn't busy and noticed there was only the Manager and one server on duty - we were seated and I asked for our drinks straight away as had read some of the reviews on here.
They arrived quickly (even sell decaf-cappuccino which was a bonus for me). Went before 5:30 so I chose from that particular menu (my cappuccino was unlimited)
What I thought was good was there were 2 different sized menus for kids, one for smaller tummies and another for the juniors with a price difference of £3 if I recall correctly.
Our food came quickly and was hot, I had the burger with coleslaw and fries (coleslaw was delicious) the girls chose pizza. Unlimited soft drinks included in their price with a choice of 3 desserts.
Overall I enjoyed the service and the tasty food. More staff appeared at 5 as it was getting busier. The staff (including the lone waitress) were attentive and can't fault the place. Will return again as a treat with my girl in the near future.
The total bill was £30 which I thought was good value, unlimited soft drinks and cappuccino also as we were all full and the girls enjoyed themselves.",Date of visit: March 2017,Frankie & Benny's New York Italian Restaurant & Bar - Leicester,1,"Leicester, United Kingdom"
Friendly inn,"Stayed here overnight as Invited to a wedding reception in Worcester.
Lady behind the bar was very friendly upon arrival and showed us to our room. Unfortunately with a nearby music festival we had to book a twin room, which did amuse as as we thought we could push the beds together (as you do), but not on this occasion. Both beds were separated by wall-so it would be great for 2 friends staying The room had a quaint charm and was very clean. Plenty of tea & coffee making facilities and tasty complimentary biscuits. 2 X shower gels & soaps, 1 large towel (this wasn't an issue as I had bought one myself) and had no doubt that if we'd have asked, the staff would have supplied another one.
We ordered ourselves a steak & cheese sandwich (which was really tasty & generous size) approx £5.80. Great value.
What made the place so lovely for us were the locals in the pub, really chatty, friendly & welcoming - give Hercules another pat from me by the way. :0)
Got back earlier than expected, so handed back the fire exit key (as the area to the room was alarmed between midnight until 07:30) and got our deposit for the key back at the same time.
After a nights sleep on a ridiculously soft bed (my idea of heaven) we came down for breakfast. Again, friendly behind the bar.
We sat in the restaurant area for our breakfast. Full English £7.50. Really filling & tasty with toast, coffee & orange juice. Just what you need after an evening drinking.
Was sorry to have to leave but we both agreed we would stay there again (though make sure we got a double room).
Just wanted to say thank you to the staff and the people we met-we had a great time.",Date of stay: September 2016,The Bulls Head Inn,1,"Inkberrow, United Kingdom"
Enjoyable,"Never been before so this year we went after hearing about it and seeing the road signs.
We paid for a family ticket (2 adults & 2 children) £22.
This years theme was BFG.
Had some real giggles walking through the maze to collect the answers to the quiz, our two girls were having a fab time running around and the quiz questions are on popular children's books including Enid Blyton. Great idea as it gave the girls a real challenge to get all the questions.
The corn & sunflowers were tall enough for two 8 year olds not to see over, us adults could just about. The maze map certainly put our sense of direction to the test.
We stopped after a couple of hours & visited the cafe over the road (highly recommend-great choice of food) and visited the little shops on the site (beautiful trinkets for the garden & home).
Re-entered the maze and completed it.
No prize at the end but there's some bits in the entrance that you can treat the kids to for doing so well if you wanted too.. Including icecreams, chocolate and cans of drinks).
All in all we spent 4/5 hours here including popping into the shops opposite.
We all enjoyed ourselves and had a great day.
If it's recently rained wear your wellies as the floor of the maze is obviously soil.
Don't not go-it's a great excuse to get the kids outside and run around.",Date of experience: September 2016,Wistow Maze,1,"Wistow, United Kingdom"
Great choice,"Popped in midway between completing the maze opposite-was pleasantly surprised with the choice of food (lovely choice of fillings for the sandwiches ie salmon & cream cheese or Brie, cranberry & bacon to name a couple). Reasonably priced and you can choose as a snack or a lunch. Average cost was approx £5 and the kids boxes were really good value (if memory serves about £4).
The outdoor seating area was terrific to relax and enjoy the surroundings and they even had a basket with blankets in to borrow if you got a little chilly! (Great idea. Thank you).
Perfect place to meet friends for coffee and light lunch - which I will be doing in the near future.",Date of visit: September 2016,Wistow Cafe Bistro,1,"Wistow, United Kingdom"
Tasty fish & chips,"This place proves to be very popular and there is always a queue for when it opens. The locals seem to use this chippy too. There's a seating area aswell which is handy if you've just spotted it driving through and don't want your car to smell of fish & chips.
The service was quick and the chips were really tasty. The fish was moist and the batter was amazing included some batter pieces too.
Recommend this place for everyone. Reasonable priced and offer kids boxes (fish cake, nuggets etc) with a small frisby as the toy. Decent size too.",Date of visit: August 2016,Snettisham Beach Fish & Chip,1,"Snettisham, United Kingdom"
Lovely cafe,"Always come to this cafe when we come to Norfolk and visit Cromer for our holidays. The staff are friendly and if not too busy, very chatty. Had a lovely small breakfast and my daughter the pancakes with strawberry sauce. She really enjoyed them (always a giveaway if she doesn't chat between bites).
Looks deceiving how small the cafe is as there are a few further tables in the patio at the back.
Having read a previous review there was a wheelchair user that entered and the staff rearranged the seats so that she had access and a good comfortable spot in the cafe.
Can't fault this place-food is varied and very tasty.
The cappuccinos in here are the nicest taking in the town in my opinion
Definitely worth a visit and if you're lucky enough to get a table outside a perfect spot to relax and watch the world go by.",Date of visit: August 2016,Cafe Main,1,"Cromer, United Kingdom"
Busy beach,"Popular beach spot and as you're heading alongside the estuary you wonder if there will be any spots left without invading any other peoples area. Needn't have worried this beach goes on forever.
Pebbly spots but plenty of golden sand and the sea does go out a fair distance but there's an estuary passage that provides constant paddling and swimming all day.
Be aware though there is a rip tide and the current is strong so be aware with any children you may take with their inflatables.
There is a lifeguard post and today there were 2 present on the bit of beach and advised to swim between the flags.
There is a cafe nearby for drinks and icecream although we took plenty of food with us for snacks.
A thoroughly enjoyable day at the beach building sand castles and swimming.
Did check other beaches close by using this app and this one is the most recommended.

The only downside were the number of dogs on the beach - and I'm a real dog lover - even though there are several signs saying no dogs-there was a separate sign advising dog owners of the area they could go to but dread to think how many were on there as there were loads on the no dog area. (I actually saw one woman watch her dog go to the toilet and then carry on walking, which anybody could have trod in. If you insist on taking your dog to the no dog area at least take plenty of doggy bags like the majority of dog owners do).

Car parking is £5 for all day, the sign is included in the photos, it's about a 20 min walk from here to the beach. Make sure you have coins as there was a notice saying a fault with the system so no card payments.",Date of experience: August 2016,Wells Next The Sea Beach,1,"Wells-next-the-Sea, United Kingdom"
Lovely little seaside town,"Whenever we come to Norfolk we come here. It's so lovely and the people are so happy and welcoming.
If you have small children you must buy a crabbing bucket, nets and bait and have a go off the pier.
Nice coffee available from the bar in the centre and plenty of seats just to watch the world go by.
Typical seaside shops in the little town and some nice cafe's.
This is a great place whatever the weather as the arcade has the 2p slot machines that will keep your kids busy if it suddenly starts to rain (and not cost the earth, unless they really do have to have that little toy just tittering on the edge but never seems to drop). ️",Date of experience: August 2016,Cromer Beach,1,"Cromer, United Kingdom"
Get discount vouchers before visiting,"50% Discount vouchers available from Tesco's in Hunstanton as you pay for your purchases. Thank goodness otherwise it would have cost £45 for 2 adults and 1 child entry fee.
An expensive couple of hours to walk round, but it was very popular and we enjoyed the tanks and information available and my favourite bit was walking past the seal hospital and seeing the baby seals that had been rescued.
The staff were very knowledgeable and knew their subject.
The shark walkway was good and the turtle inside the tank was huge.
The 'finding Dory' letters for the kids hidden in the tanks was a good focus and had my girl looking at every single display and learning as she went along.
You can touch a crab or a starfish in the 'rock pool' and get a medal.
My daughter loves the sealife centres so for £24.50 it was worth it and she learns.

Tasty food,"Wandering around the town and started feeling peckish spotted this little place and noticed how popular it seemed. We went in and although it was a late lunch (2 o'clock) it was still busy, we were greeted by a very pleasant lady and were seated in the window. We were going to just have the cream tea each but asked for the lunch menu All the food sounded really tasty soup of the day £5 and other meals from £7 to £11 My Mum & I both chose the goats cheese, pepper, olives and tomato with rocket on bread (£7) my daughter chose from the children's menu £6 inc icecream.
We also had de-caff cappuccinos, which was terrific as not widely available in small places to eat. My daughter chose a milkshake, usual flavours: strawberry, vanilla or banana, didn't stop there also had Oreo and Malteser flavour!
The service was quick and even though they were busy the waitresses were attentive, pleasant and patient.
The food was amazingly tasty and my Mum & I felt it was a real treat to have found this place to eat. The bill came to £28 which is a bit pricey for lunch but as this was a treat for 3 generations of family and a very rare trip into Shrewsbury, a very tasty lunch with a terrific service, genuinely lovely waitresses I would not hesitate to return here when we next visit the town.
Plenty of choice on the menu so something for everyone. All age ranges inside and a lovely relaxed atmosphere. Well worth all the reviews written before mine.",Date of visit: April 2016,Number Four,1,"Shrewsbury, United Kingdom"
Highly recommended,"Visited the sea life centre with my friend and our daughters.
Came out for food (to return when it was quieter). Had read the reviews here so chose this place to eat (rather than the seemingly obvious choice). And did those people really missed out!
This place was fantastic. From the moment we walked in the two ladies behind the counter were brilliant and genuinely friendly (loved the lilac hair style btw). We chose our table (it was relatively quiet-which was a shame). The decor was lovely, fresh and clean.
We chose our food and drinks from the menus (plenty of choice for adults, present your ticket when you pay and they give you 20% discount off the bill if you've been to the sea life centre that day.
The kids menu was under £5 with about 5 choices. They both chose the beef burger. When it arrived they were a generous portion (my 8yo couldn't eat it all and she has eyes bigger than her belly). They bought a side salad out for our daughters as she heard one of them mention lettuce, which was a lovely gesture.
I had the Philly steak panini (inc photo) approx £6.50 and my friend had the baked potato with chilli and cheese approx £5. The chips were really tasty and not the average French fries you always seem to get.
The salad that came with our meals was fresh, crisp and a lovely tasting vinaigrette.
My food was delicious and worth every penny - filling too, it had green, red & yellow strips of peppers and mushrooms on the panini aswell. Really, really enjoyed it.
My friend said the chilli was great and really tasty and the baked potato had generous amount of butter on it, so even though she'd eat all the chilli she still enjoyed the rest of the potato too as it wasn't dry (through lack of butter).
The cappuccino I had was heavenly and perfect size for a caffeine kick to get through the queues back at the sea life centre.
Our girls were totally relaxed in here and even though it was seemingly empty there was a lovely atmosphere.
Please don't go to the most obvious place when you come out of the sea life, walk to the left over the bridge) about 20 paces - you will find this real gem of a place.
Thank you ladies, it really did make our day out fabulous.",Date of visit: February 2016,Dubella Lounge,1,"Birmingham, United Kingdom"
Kids loved it,"Our children couldn't wait to get running around.
We both had hot drinks, but didn't fancy any of the food on offer (nothing on the menu looked very appetising).
All the kids were running around having the time of their lives, very red faced and excited with everything, the climbing up the tree was well managed and no waiting even though the place was packed.
Highly recommend this for a rainy day, though go with an adult friend as, if you were on your own you would be very bored.
We had to get our kids out kicking & screaming - they didn't want to leave, us adults were starving.",Date of experience: February 2016,Go Kids Go Leicester,1,"Leicester, United Kingdom"
