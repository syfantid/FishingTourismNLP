Amazing authentic fishing experience!!!!,"Such a great experience to go and fish with Anthi. It has been a long time since I was looking for an authentic fishing experience... and I've found the best one in Santorini... 5 hours of fishing, eating fantastic shrimps and fishes, jumping into the transparent water... Everything was nice during this trip and I'll warmly recommand this experience to my friends. We even got 2 octopuses... So great!",Date of experience: June 2016,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,1,"Santorini, Greece"
