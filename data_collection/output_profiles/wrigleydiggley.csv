Airport transfer,"DONT use Supershuttle from JFK. I booked a return journey, confirmed 24 hours beforehand, received confirmation email; after waiting for an hour for the pick up I phoned - they told me the booking had been cancelled. I didn't cancel it, apparently it was cancelled at a time when I was in the theatre, I had no cancellation email ( they eventually emailed me an hour after the supposed pick up time) and they couldn't tell me who cancelled it, and it was too late to send another transfer bus. I had to get more cash out and hail a cab. They have not responded to my emails complaining about it. Totally unreliable - book elsewhere.",Date of experience: April 2016,SuperShuttle,1,"Newark, New Jersey"
