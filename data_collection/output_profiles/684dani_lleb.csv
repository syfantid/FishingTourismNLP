Fishing with Michalis,"One of the most memorable days of our holiday in Kefalonia. Antonia and the crew welcomed us with some greek coffee (not our thing) and some delicious cake. They then took us to their nets and showed us the hard work of a fisherman. After a swim in the sea, they treated us with a great seafood lunch (2 kinds of lobster, seafood spaghetti, 2 kinds of salad and 7 different fishes). Delicious!

P.S. Book a day without Italian people (kidding of course, had a great day with Gabrio and the rest)!",Date of experience: September 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
