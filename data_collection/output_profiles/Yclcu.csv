Excellent fishing trip,"After reading the reviews our expectations were set high and we were not disappointed, great fishing experience with lovely Greek hosts serving the freshest caught fish, lobster and crab for lunch, even our teenage son was impressed. If you want to try something with an intimate setting, would highly recommend this trip. Thank you for a lovely time xx",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
