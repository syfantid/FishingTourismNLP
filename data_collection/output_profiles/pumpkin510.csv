"Brilliant fun, if you don't mind getting a bit dirty!","A brilliant morning out! We had a really fun time travelling though the fantastic scenery in the polaris, and had a lot of fun! We also spent time with a lovely family who let us taste their own honey and home made drinks (And very kindly let us use their bathroom). I would highly recommend and will book this again on our next trip to Rhodes.
We needed 2 showers and a dip in the pool when we got back to get rid of the dust, but it was so much fun!",Date of experience: September 2019,4x4 Buggy Adventures - Off-road Polaris Experience,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
Excellent Experience,"Wonderful day out fishing. The crew were great, funny and really helpful (And very good cooks!). Would highly recommend.",Date of experience: September 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
Super Modern,"This hotel was perfect for us, small but very functional and the shower was brilliant. It was very clean and high-tech and the cafe area had such a good feel to it. The breakfast was basic but good quality and the staff always very friendly and willing to help.
Our view wasn't spectacular but we were out all day being tourists so that didn't matter.
Highly recommend!",Date of stay: October 2018,Hub by Premier Inn Edinburgh City Centre (Rose Street) hotel,5,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
