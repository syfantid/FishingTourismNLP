riverside,"This place is a toilet!!!!!!!!!!!
The rudest staff I have ever met with one exception.The food is appalling
The slightest problem seemed to.be the guests fault,Fawlty towers without the wit
I am struggling to find any thing good about this.place,the room was okay,the pool area was good.but how.about the gully between the pools a broken leg waiting to happen
Do.not go !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
