Wonderful Crew,,Sail Date: February 2020,Marella Celebration,1,World
Great if it doesn’t rain,"The Sky ride and zip line are a relatively new attraction. We went up on the chair lift, takes about 30 minutes, lovely views, however it started to rain very heavily half way up and got saturated. Just a small bar and viewing platform at the summit you then have an option to come down very fast on the Zip line or do the return in the chair lift. No small shops and bars close bye so if you want a drink or food only the main quite pricey restaurant.",Date of experience: March 2020,Sky Explorer and Flying Dutchman,1,St Martin / St Maarten
Beautiful Place to Visit,"We were on Marella Celebration and took a ships tour, a little pricy but worth the money as we were very fortunate to have June Skinner as our local tour guide. The weather was glorious learnt a great deal about the history of the Island and the Dockyard from June. Some beautiful yachts in the harbour a lovely pace to spend an hour or two.",Date of experience: March 2020,Nelson's Dockyard,1,Antigua
"Lovely atmosphere, good food, excellent value for money.","Just had a lovely pre Christmas get together lunch and giving top marks to The Lodge. Very reasonably priced Festive menu with lots of choices, good size portions and excellent service. I personally had the salmon main course, it was delicious but could have been perfect with the addition of a sauce, that is the only small criticism I have, so very well done to The Lodge, as some of us oldies are not that easy to please lol. Would like to thank Angela, Hannah, Vicki, Loren and Wendy for looking after us so well.",Date of visit: December 2019,The Lodge Country Inn,1,"Battlesbridge, United Kingdom"
Fabulous,"First visit to this excellent restaurant for my birthday lunch, everything was first class, the service was excellent and very reasonable prices will certainly return very soon.",Date of visit: October 2019,Malaya,1,"Benfleet, United Kingdom"
Perfectly Plush,"Second visit in a month to this lovely restaurant. Have eaten from both the main menu and the Lunch menu and just cannot find fault in anything. Food is delicious, service is first class and prices very reasonable. First time I have sampled Turkish wine and so impressed really good. I particularly recommend the Lamb Shish, nuggets of beautifully cook lamb served with rice and salad. Everything we had was really well presented and delicious. So good have booked to take my friends for my birthday on a Friday evening when they have entertainment.",Date of visit: September 2019,Plush Restaurant,1,"Wickford, United Kingdom"
We Should Never Forget,"Poignant, inspiring and unmissable. This small attic in Amsterdam captures what Europe’s Jewish community suffered in those dreadful years. It’s a Memorial, beautifully preserved but sadly reflects man’s inhumanity to man. The Dutch are a warm gentle nation and we were made so welcome in their beautiful country.",Date of experience: August 2019,Anne Frank House,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Almost 5 Star,"I agree with so much I read in advance on TripAdvisor. Breakfast limited choice but delicious, rooms lovely but access only via a spiral staircase a bit difficult for the over 70's. Great touch that the rooms all have tea/coffee and bottled fresh water daily. Staff were excellent. The restaurant was very busy, a little overpriced and ok but not special.",Date of visit: August 2019,Loetje Overveen,1,"Overveen, The Netherlands"
Elegant and Welcoming,"Beautiful restaurant to visit, as two ladies dining alone we were made most welcome and selected dinner from the set menu. I had Mackerel Pate followed Salmon my competition the Goats Cheese followed by Sausage and Mash. Only managed two courses but they were delicious, staff were friendly and helpful. Our bill was £61.50 including a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc so good value as well.",Date of visit: August 2019,The Barn Brasserie,1,"Great Tey, United Kingdom"
Simply The Best,"If you like meat you will be in heaven. On a six day visit to Overveen we dinned in this amazing restaurant four times. I had rack of lamb, pork ribs, ribeye steak and sole all followed by delicious beautifully presented deserts. It has it all, unique location, great food, excellent service and give how the Pound is against the Euro very good value.",Date of visit: August 2019,Klein Centraal,1,"Overveen, The Netherlands"
Wow how this restaurant has changed since my last visit.,"Gone are the old wood spoons with your table number on, no longer do you go up to the bar to order your food, replaced by excellent table service. This meal was so unexpectedly good, I had the Sea Bass served with beautiful fresh vegetables and a deliciously fragrant sauce, cooked to perfection. I could only manage a mini desert of crumble and ice cream again perfect. The food prices, given the quality, were just about right. The drinks however, were City prices and a bit on the high side. Will certainly be back for another visit very soon.",Date of visit: July 2019,The Hawk,1,"Battlesbridge, United Kingdom"
Good but expensive for lunch when set menu is not available.,"On a Saturday shopping visit to Chelmsford decided to treat ourselves to a fish lunch. Been to this restaurant before but only midweek so found it a little pricey for lunch as no set menu was offered. Both my companion and I had the Goan fish curry simply served with rice, it was fragrant and delicious. Our waiter Barish was charming and even serenaded us. All this topped of with a glass of chilled Sauvignon Blanc what better way could you find to spend an afternoon.",Date of visit: July 2019,Loch Fyne Seafood & Grill,1,"Chelmsford, United Kingdom"
Pricy but Perfect,"All of my favourite dishes in one lunch. Beautiful scallops with apple and bacon, served correctly with coral on, as a starter. Grilled middle of skate that melted in your mouth, with baby new potatoes and best green beans I have tasted and tartar sauce that didn’t come out of a jar. To finish a simple sweet raspberry sorbet and a delicious vanilla ice cream garnished with fresh raspberries and mint leaves. Sheer perfection but food this good does come at a price, as a treat this restaurant is a must.",Date of visit: July 2019,Felix Warley Ltd,1,"Brentwood, United Kingdom"
Surprisingly very good,"Basically I am a food snob, but having seen the TV add for the new wraps, and finding myself unusually alone for lunch decided to give it a try. The restaurant was spotlessly clean and I was greeted by a lovely lady who showed my how to work the automated ordering service. By chance my choice of wrap was the special of the day at £1.99p. I was asked if I wanted the chicken grilled or breaded. The wrap and a coffee were served to my table in just minutes freshly cooked and delicious. The coffee was hot and flavoursome and not served in a bucket. I was spoken to by three members of staff all made me feel most welcome, especially appreciated as I was on my own. If the person who has this McDonalds franchise is reading this your team are to be congratulated.",Date of visit: July 2019,Mcdonalds,1,"Basildon, United Kingdom"
Very Disappointing,"I lunch out regularly with a group of friends and this was out third visit to Harry's Bar, I checked their menu on line and it clearly offered a fixed price set lunch deal. I rang the restaurant in the morning before our visit to up the number of guests so they should have mentioned that this lunch menu had been withdrawn and replaced with just sandwiches and tapas. The restaurant was almost empty which should have rung alarm bells. Service was slow, sandwiches were poorly presented and very heavy on the bread and not what we would have chosen. Prices were expensive given what we had, Competition in Billericay is fierce so Harry's Bar need to pull their socks up.",Date of visit: July 2019,Harry's Bar,1,"Billericay, United Kingdom"
Where has the quality gone?,"Mediocre food, very basic decor and staff that that did not know what the daily specials were (which sadly turned out not to be very special) and had no idea what was on the wine list. Prices we thought given the very average quality of the food were high a real disappointment all round.",Date of visit: June 2019,Barleylands Tearooms,1,"Billericay, United Kingdom"
Every meal was spot on perfect.,"Five different dishes from Fish and Chips to Katsu Chicken, from House Salmon Salad to Scampi all cooked really well and beautifully presented. The restaurant is lovely to visit very stylish and the prices, given the quality are very reasonable. All the staff were excellent and a special ‘Thank You’ to Mat who explained the advantages to us of having Reid’s Loyalty Card’.",Date of visit: June 2019,Reids Restaurant,1,"Billericay, United Kingdom"
Fabulous,"Just had the most delicious lunch with good friends. Great selection of dishes, generous portion size, lovely decor, good service and very reasonable prices. Well done all round to the Royal Tiger.",Date of visit: June 2019,Royal Tiger,1,"Chelmsford, United Kingdom"
Can’t think of anything good about our lunch.,"I rarely write very negative reviews as I was in the hospitality industry myself for over 40 years and can appreciate that problems do occur even in the best run establishments. However, lunch today was a disaster, all over cooked and badly presented. The basic ingredients were good quality but just so badly cooked all our meals were inedible. The pub was unpredictability busy for a Tuesday lunch session, that could give a reason for a longer than usual wait but no excuse for the dreadful food that eventually arrived. Not sure which Pub Company own this Pub but they seriously need to put someone in to sort it out or they will loose good regular dinners.",Date of visit: June 2019,Downham Arms,1,"Wickford, United Kingdom"
Three Star but it ticks all the boxes.,"Very clean, centrally situated, good ‘Pub Grub’ style food and lovely staff. Join their loyalty scheme and you get a free early checkin and late checkout plus 10% off food and bar purchases. It claims to be three star and that is exactly what you get so from me it’s a thumbs up to the Ibis team.",Date of stay: June 2019,Ibis Belfast City Centre,1,"Belfast, United Kingdom"

Sad and Poignant,"Seen so many times on television as a central point of the conflict in Belfast and now a tourist attraction, it left me with a feeling of great sadness. Better cameras than bullets, an incredibly poignant place, and a very important part of the story of a divided city.",Date of experience: June 2019,Falls Road,1,"Belfast, United Kingdom"

It’s a Marmite Experience Love it or Hate it.,"I loved it. What an afternoon! When they say bottomless Prosecco they really mean it. Food was tasty but quite small, other drinks were expensive, entertainment was cheesy but great, atmosphere was amazing. The staff were excellent and coped well with so many happily pissed people. We were very lucky to share a table with a great group of people if they are reading this a big thank you xxx Nanny Gel",Date of visit: June 2019,Tropicana Beach Club,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Great Food Excellent Service Pricy on the Wine,"Spent two lovely hours in the Cambridge sunshine yesterday afternoon at this great restaurant. The food we had was delicious, well cooked, very fresh and beautifully presented and the prices, given the location and quality, exceptional value. The staff were very product knowledgeable and friendly. Only one thing preventing me giving five stars was the rather pricey wine with a very ordinary bottle of Sauvignon Blanc at £22.50 whilst the food was under £15 each including a nice tip.",Date of visit: May 2019,La Raza,1,"Cambridge, United Kingdom"
Eight Hard To Please OAP’s Had A Fantastic Time,"On a day trip to the Beautiful City of Cambridge we were eight ladies all between 70 and 80 with various combinations of dodgy joints and replacement knees on a punt. Just getting on and off was a challenge, but was it worth it? Yes indeed it was. A really magical hour through the amazing colleges of Cambridge a really unmissable experience. Hope you are reading this Patrick our punt chauffeur and guide a big ‘Thank You’ from us all xxx love Nanny Gel and the Ladies.",Date of experience: May 2019,Trinity Punts,1,"Cambridge, United Kingdom"
Good But 4 Star Rather than 5,"What makes this hotel so pleasant to stay in is the staff, every one of them excellent. The rooms are large and well equipped, very clean and all have tea and coffee making facilities. The food was just a little hit and miss, sometimes your were spoiled for choice others I struggled a bit to find something I liked. However, the breakfast was always fabulous. The entertainment team were very friendly and very young and just a bit lacking in talent so it came across a bit amateur, still very early in the season so may well improve later. The AI drinks package was good. All pool areas were excellent.",Date of stay: May 2019,Rhodes Bay Hotel & Spa,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Need More Information,Was really looking forward to visiting this attraction wanted to do a tour or have an audio earpiece but nothing was available so much of the information about this amazing building was just not available.,Date of experience: May 2019,Palace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Most Unique Sunday Lunch I Have Experienced,"I am in my early seventies and to be honest when I saw the relatively small aged fishing boat, my heart sank, especially as I was suffering with an excess of the all inclusive wine from the night before. To make matters worse the sea was choppy but the amazing Captain Makaroynas came to the rescue with seasickness pills and then served the most delicious lunch of the holiday. The actual fishing was really it for me, but taken as a whole a great day out.",Date of experience: May 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
What a disappointment!,"Have visited this restaurant before and was very surprised at how the quality had slipped. We wanted a bottle of House White Wine and asked what it was to be told it was a mixture of Chardonnay, Pino and Sauvignon, a surprising description more accurate, cheap plonk at almost £19 a bottle not a good buy. The food was bland and ordinary, two of us had the small plate stir fried steak salad, tiny tiny portion. Two others had the gammon, egg and chips, extremely salty and not even well presented. We had to send back knives, forks and a plate because they were dirty. It is rare that I give negative feedback as I was myself in the catering trade for many years and appreciate all the problems that can occur. There was nothing about our visit to this establishment that would make us want to return.",Date of visit: May 2019,The Dukes Head,1,"Billericay, United Kingdom"
Lovely Afternoon in London,"I was treated to this very unique afternoon tea as a late Mother’s Day present. The sandwiches and cakes were absolutely delicious, the service excellent such a unique and lovely experience. Only one slight criticism, for me, sconces must have fruit especially sultanas in them and B Bakery scones were plain. Other than that perfect.",Date of experience: April 2019,Brigit's Bakery Bus,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Magnificent,"Visited this lovely restaurant with family last night and up front I have to admit I know nothing about Thai food however, my son who has spent some time in Thailand helped me with choices and the results were amazing. Flavours were fragrant, light and delicious. Can’t post exactly what we had because I couldn’t spell it correctly but the whole experience was first class. We finished our meal with home made ice creams just spectacular. I have also to mention how good the service was especially as we had three children with us, we were not given a one and a half hour time slot to complete our meal as it has become popular for restaurants to do especially on a Saturday night. Finally the price, given the quality of our meal, not cheap eats but just about right.",Date of visit: March 2019,SoPa Thai,1,"Westcliff-on-Sea, United Kingdom"
New menu at Watermill surprisingly good.,"Visited this restaurant for dinner last night with friends. My previous visits had been some years ago and back then the quality was very hit and miss. Last night, with the new menu just introduced everything was surprisingly good. Our waitress Karen B was excellent with just the right mix of humour and professionalism, the food was excellent, portion size generous and prices just about right. Must mention the wine which was basic white but at under £12 great value. An all round ‘Well Done’ to the Watermill.",Date of visit: March 2019,Beefeater The Watermill,1,"Basildon, United Kingdom"
So very disappointed with our visit.,"We were a party of five ladies arriving for lunch just after noon last Tuesday. We were told that the chef had been called away on family business but they could offer us a slight reduced, but still delicious lunch service. The lady serving us was very nice so we decided to give it a try. We were only offered a choice of three items, ham egg and chips, fish and chips or ploughman’s plus limited choice of sandwiches. We were given no menu or any indication of price. We had three fish and two ham, they turned out to be ok, but were charged at a full ‘Chef’ prepared menu price. One or two of our party had very average deserts. So disappointed as we had heard such great things about the food in this pub. Sadly we found it over priced and very average. The staff however were lovely and in truth, without the chef, they may have been better to shut the kitchen.",Date of visit: February 2019,The Fox and Hounds,1,"Billericay, United Kingdom"
"Not Good, overpriced, over decorated, and pretentious.","So very disappointed, nothing was homemade, except possible the sandwiches. The scones were warm and pleasant BUT the cream was definitely not Cornish and the only jam on offer strawberry, which I am not a fan of. The little cakes were straight from a supermarket. What more to say all round could have been much better.",Date of visit: January 2019,Mad Dogs & Englishmen,1,"Leigh-on Sea, United Kingdom"
This place buzzes,"A market full of exceptional food surrounded by restaurants favouring fish. Really enjoyed a couple of visits to this area, the market was amazing we did have lunch in one of the restaurants, it was exceptionally busy, quite expensive and service took ages. I had the seafood peilla, pricey and over cooked my partner had a steak which her says was one of the best he has ever tasted so all round just about made it to four stars.",Date of experience: December 2018,Mercat de la Boqueria,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Fabulous Seaks,"What a find this fabulous little restaurant was, five minutes off La Rambalas, only noticed it because it’s front window was a fridge full of steak. I had a bone-on sirloin and my partner a signature burger both were exceptional. Service was good and prices reasonable. If in Barcelona certainly worth a visit.",Date of visit: January 2019,National Burger,1,"Barcelona, Spain"

A Football Lovers Heaven,Just short of euro 30 each to look round the stadium and museum. Personally I am not a football fan my partner is so I grudgingly went along and have to say I was impressed. The tour is well organised and even for someone like me very interesting.,Date of experience: January 2019,Camp Nou,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Breathtaking,The inside of this amazing building is now finished and it is easy to see why it is the number one tourist attraction in Spain.

The Best in Barcelona,Just returned from seven nights at this wonderful hotel. Staff were really helpful nothing was too much trouble. The hotel has an underground station just opposite and you and within walking distance of the harbour and La Ramblas. One thing I would point out this hotel in on a main road and the rooms on the front can be noisy. Over all this is an excellent location to visit beautiful Barcelona. Big thank you to all the staff especially.,Date of stay: January 2019,Hotel Barcelona Universal,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Good as 3 Star Goes,"Just returned from a weekend at this hotel where we were celebrating a 90th birthday and it is, what it is, a 3 Star in Yarmouth and most of those stars are shining. However, a couple of things do need attention, the hot water in the evening is scarce at best, and the basement room that hosts the evening entertainment is not large enough for the amount of guests staying at the hotel. On the Saturday night (The main celebration night) we were unable to get a seat and spent the entire evening in the bar. On the plus side the food was excellent and the staff very friendly.",Date of stay: November 2018,Bay Carlton Hotel,1,"Great Yarmouth, United Kingdom"
Wonderful Afternoon of Nostalgic Music and Poetry,"November 11th 2018 we attended a lovely and very moving tribute to the music and poetry associated with two Word Wars at this lovely little theatre.

Don’t go until renovation work is finished.,"In the past have visited Romford Dogs numerous times always a great experience, so when a friend asked if I would like to join her for lunch and an afternoon at the Dogs I was right there. What a disaster, only one tine restaurant open, the rest of the stadium a building site. The dogs did run round the building site but were almost invisible from our restaurant table. There was no atmosphere and even the TV’s showing the races were blurred. On the plus side the food served at lunch was lovely.",Date of experience: November 2018,Romford Greyhound Stadium,1,"Romford, United Kingdom"
Excellent Value but best not to turn up the lights.,"Cost wise great value, comfort and decor a bit lacking but there was free parking. This is an old building and it has been made the most of but could really do with some new seats and some TLC. However, the film (the main reason you are there) is just as good as in any pricy Cinema Complex.",Date of experience: September 2018,Movie Starr Cinema,1,"Canvey Island, United Kingdom"
Great Little Restaurant,"My first visit to this great little restaurant, to call it a Fish and Chip shop would do it a great disservice, a lovely place for a reasonable priced Fish Supper.

Big ‘Well Done’ Islanders.",Date of visit: September 2018,Islanders Fish Restaurant,1,"Canvey Island, United Kingdom"
Lovely Decor Food OK,"Fire jacks is new to Festival Leisure food was not great but Ok. However, I do get a bit cross when every item on your plate is priced separately, even the burger does not come with fries. In general the flavours were good but the food could have been served hotter. I thought the bar prices were high with a standard pint of San Miguel at £4.85.",Date of visit: September 2018,Firejacks,1,"Basildon, United Kingdom"

Expensive and very Average,"Visited this restaurant last night with family, was surprised at how expensive and average we found it given the generally good TripAdvisor reviews.

Great for children but not brilliant for the over 70’s,"For the children heaven on earth BUT at a cost. Facilities great but restaurants average and overpriced. If traveling by car from UK suggest you take as much food with you as you can as the local supermarkets are way more expensive than here. I enjoyed watching my grandchildren having fun but this attraction is not for older people. Also, not much to see in the local area, we were there for 7 days but I think a shorted break would have been better.",Date of stay: August 2018,Center Parcs Erperheide,1,"Peer, Belgium"
Wonderful way to spend an afternoon,Finding ourselves recently in a very wet Edinburgh looking for a way to stay dry was recommended a tour of Britannia and it turned out to be the highlight of our trip to Scotland.

Fabulous but not for Weight Watchers,"Hugh portions of excellent food, not cheap eats but well worth the money.

Best Value in Benalmadena,"Visited this amazing restaurant twice in one week, under 12 Euro for three courses, bottle of wine between two, coffee and liqueur. Best value for money I have had anywhere, the food, given the price, was first class. There was a very good choice on the menu, I tried the steak with peppercorn sauce and the grilled sole, never got as far as desert on either occasion as I was too full, but looking around the deserts looked lovely. I visited out of season and the place was very busy so I would assume it essential to book if you don't want to miss out on this amazing deal. This restaurant is very close to Capones Nightclub where the entertainment was great so two great nights out all round.",Date of visit: April 2018,Casa Eduardo,1,"Benalmadena, Spain"

Best Chinese Restaurant I have visited in a very long while,"We has the £20 per person recommended menu. Mixed starters followed by Duck and pancakes the main a wonderful selection of Chinese classics. Exceptional quality and lots of delicious flavours at a very reasonable price. I would totally recommend this restaurant for a group of friends dining together.

Best food in Basildon Town Centre,"Spotlessly clean, good service, reasonable prices and excellent menus choices, in fact the best food I have had in Basildon for a very long while. What was so good to see was that the owners were there to greet you and keeping a constant eye on quality and it surely paid off. All round full marks to Miracles.",Date of visit: March 2018,Miracles Bistro,1,"Basildon, United Kingdom"
The making of a magical memory.,"Just had lunch with my son at this amazing venue. It is an eating experience, and most definitely not for the ‘I like it plain’ dinners. The Ox cheek donut as a starter was amazing. However, for my taste the garlic and rosemary bread was too heavy on the garlic and a bit stogie. Our shared main of roast chicken just perfect, we could not even look at the desert menu, far too full. Best of all and what helps to make a visit to this restaurant so special were the wonderful views of a sunlit London skyline.",Date of visit: March 2018,Duck & Waffle,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Italian more Benfleet than Bardolino,"Good atmosphere, nice food, reasonable prices but if you have eaten Italian in Italy then this is most definitely the Benfleet version. I have given it four star as I really enjoyed the ambience the staff were very friendly and the food was ok. We went on a Saturday night and it was packed and a bit noisy for me so my next visit will be midweek.",Date of visit: March 2018,Gambero D'oro Benfleet,1,"Benfleet, United Kingdom"
An amazing find,"Just a lovely experience, wonderful food, excellent service, good wine at an amazingly good value price.

"Good food, good flavours at a good price.","Visited this restaurant for the first time for lunch yesterday. Very busy with lots of choices all the food was tasty, well presented and good value at £9 each for an all you can eat buffet. You could have Indian, Chinese or Italian so those who like lots of choice and lots of food this is the place for you. Also loads of cakes, crapes and ice creams. Only one criticism the food could have been a bit hotter however, this is so often the case with this style of buffet. My personal choice is for table service but for the all you can eat buffet lover this is paridice.",Date of visit: March 2018,Spoon World Buffet & Bar,1,"Basildon, United Kingdom"
Great food excellent service good value.,"Had dinner with family last night could not fault this restaurant. Lovely flavours, nice portion size and good presentation.

The staff made us most welcome so we are already planning our next visit.",Date of visit: February 2018,Osteria Due Amici,1,"Upminster, United Kingdom"
Really not very good,"Dinner with family at TGI Friday was not a good experience. To start drinks at the bar: if you order a G & T it was served in a Whisky tumbler and not a Gin bowl or long glass, you only get half the tonic the rest goes on to the next customer so each bottle of tonic is paid for twice. Other drinks were well present but the amount of alcohol for the price charged was questionable. Our starters were ok. The steaks however, were really not very good at all, tough and gristly. Salads were bland and served with no dressing and the vegetable selection just raw broccoli. No member of staff came to enquire if our food was ok which very clearly it wasn’t. TGI Friday you seriously could do better.

Lovely Food and Good Service,"Six old friends enjoyed a lovely lunch, no hassle no rush, good size portions and great food, especially for the mini desserts they were devine. I have given 5 stars for the quality of the food, the service (thank you Chole and Jordan) and the general ambiance however, the wine was in my view way overpriced with a very ordinary Pino at £21.95. It was also a very nice touch at the end of the meal that the duty Manager Johnny came and introduced himself to us. So all in all very well done to the Duke's Head Team but do keep an eye on those wine prices as it will put us Ladies who lunch off if we feel our lunchtime tipple is overpriced.",Date of visit: February 2018,The Dukes Head,1,"Billericay, United Kingdom"
Fabulous but not for Weight Watchers,"Hugh portions of excellent food, not cheap eats but well worth the money. The appearance of this Pub is stunning with the best display of hanging baskets in Essex. More a restaurant that sells alcohol than a traditional style pub. After the very large main course portions it was good to see that you could select a light desert from a single scoop of ice cream upwards.",Date of visit: July 2018,The Anchor,1,"Danbury, United Kingdom"
Stunning York Minster,"We went around this amazing building with a very knowledgeable Guide you can miss so much by just walking round on your own.

Would like to say a big 'Thank You' to Mark and the lovely Jo for the great food, drinks and service, Can throughly recommend the strawberry gin and tonic and the corned beef and beetroot sandwiches.

Best Value in Benalmadena,"Visited this amazing restaurant twice in one week, under 12 Euro for three courses, bottle of wine between two, coffee and liqueur. Best value for money I have had anywhere, the food, given the price, was first class. There was a very good choice on the menu, I tried the steak with peppercorn sauce and the grilled sole, never got as far as desert on either occasion as I was too full, but looking around the deserts looked lovely. I visited out of season and the place was very busy so I would assume it essential to book if you don't want to miss out on this amazing deal. This restaurant is very close to Capones Nightclub where the entertainment was great so two great nights out all round.",Date of visit: April 2018,Casa Eduardo,1,"Benalmadena, Spain"
A Taste of the UK in the Sunshine,"Big thank you to Chris and her staff for the warm welcome and lovely food.

Given the prestigious location a good find.,"Three friends dined together from the set dinner menu, very generous portions, rather limited choice but all in all at £15.95 good value given the location. House wine was very nice and served at the perfect temperature again London prices but ok value. The restaurant was beautifully warm on what was a very cold night, staff were excellent and we were offered to take home what we could not finish, so when I got home my partner enjoyed two thirds of a pizza as it was hugh. One thing to note that if you chose from the main menu there was a very good selection but all sides was charged as an extra so could be a bit pricey especially fir a mid week treat.",Date of visit: January 2018,L'ulivo Italian Restaurant,1,"London, United Kingdom"
It's Italian food a la Basildon,"We were a table of ten all ordering something different so quite a challenge for any establishment. The portions were very large and left us all unable to even look at the desert menu. It was all a little heavy for me except for the garlic bread which was delicious. We had a bottle of House white wine which was almost room temperature. However, the service was polite and the atmosphere good. Price, just about what you would expect to pay, one course, garlic bread and a glass of wine £20 good for mid week or after the cinema, but not a special occasion venue.",Date of visit: January 2018,Bella Italia,1,"Basildon, United Kingdom"

An Amazing Christmas Experience,"Visited this beautiful place yesterday, day started with a tour of the building and our group was fortunate to have the Lady of the House as our guide, she was so interesting and knowledgeable of the history of the Tower. This was followed by a three course lunch, the starter and desert were excellent however, the main course of Turkey would have greatly benefited with a jug of really hot gravey on each table and for the roast potatoes to have been crispy. I have still given day 5 stars as the entertainment after lunch in the Church, a potted version of A Christmas Carol was wonderful. Simply put the performance was fabulous. The afternoon came to a close with mulled wine and mince pies a lovely wat to start the Christmas festivities.",Date of experience: December 2017,Layer Marney Tower,1,"Layer Marney, United Kingdom"
Great fit Ladies who Lunch,Had a lovely lunch with friends just before menu went over to Christmas food. Price was very reasonable and service was good. Off lunch or dinner special menu a bit expensive but stay with the set meals it’s a real treat.

Way Beyond Expectations,"Visited this establishment for dinner with two friends and when I realised it was a venue where you had to find a table, take its number and order at the bar, my expectations were not that high. However I was very pleasantly surprised, the wine was reasonably priced, beautifully chilled and you were given an ice bucket without having to ask.We shared two starter between three of us baked camembert and a selection of bread and olives, simply delicious. Two of us had seebass for mains and the other a slow cooked pork belly. Really good portions and very tasty. We finished off with Eaton Mess (made as it should be with raspberries) and Coffee. All of the above, with our discount vouchers, less than £20 per head. Now that's what I call value for money. Well done all round the White Horse.",Date of visit: November 2017,The White Horse,1,"Chelmsford, United Kingdom"

Meals came complete with appropriate side dishes we tried both the local specialities and the steak dishes both were excellent.

Great Place to Eat Lunch with Friends,"Just had a lovely lunch with six friends, we all ate from the 'June Special Menu' although the choice was a little limited the quality was excellent. I had the mussel risotto, simply exquisite and very filling so I followed it with ice cream, there was a good range of flavours and lovely rich creamy texture. Price was very good under £20 each including a drink and service. We all decided that a return visit to sample the 'July Menu' was a must.

Breakfast was Continental and delicious. Dinner had limited choice and was adiquate with plenty of quantity but a little lacking in quality.
