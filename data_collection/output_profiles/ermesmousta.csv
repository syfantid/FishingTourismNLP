A Perfect boat trip,"We started from pollonia at 10 in the morning the we went to collect the fishing nets , whatever we caught we ate it! After we went to poliegos to some wonderful places and beaches. We stopped wherever we wanted for swimming. The crew : Marios and Captain Adreas was the best. They offered us handmade traditional food and they made the traditional fisherman soup called kakavia with the fish that we caught in the morning! It was the best food that we ate in Milos!!! At the last stop we ate food from their farm. Everything was perfect and this experience was the best in milos! We advise it because it was very fun and enjoiable",Date of experience: August 2018,Milos Poseidon Boat Fishing & Tours,5,"Milos, Greece"
