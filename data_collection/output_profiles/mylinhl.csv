MUST-DO IN RHODES,We went on the fishing trip and it was absolutely fantastic. The service was amazing and the captain is really nice and friendly. During the city tour you had a beautiful view of the city. We caught many fishes and ate them later on. They even prepared chicken for the ones who couldn‘t eat fish. It was very delicious!! Because it was the birthday of one of us they also brought cake! I really recommend this trip for anyone who’s on Rhodes. It was beyond our expectations and you‘re really missing out if you don’t go. It‘s really really worth the price (50€ per person food and drinks included).,Date of experience: July 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
