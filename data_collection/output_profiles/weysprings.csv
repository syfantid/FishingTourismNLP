Brilliant day out,My family of four took the boot trip in the afternoon and we had a wonderful time. We went round the habour for soem nice views and then settled down for some fishing. Altogther we caught 20 or so fish and then went for a swim off the boat while the crew of 3 cooked us a meal of sea bream caught further out plus our fish. The crew looked after us very well. Its a great way to spend a few hours away from the rush and bustle of Rhodes.,Date of experience: July 2017,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"

Superb little find,"Our two familes met there for lunch to celebrate our respective eldest's 18th birthdays.The food and service was excellent and we were very well looked after. The portion sizes were very generous and everyone left full and satisfied.

Superb little find,"My family and I were on our way to Exeter when we stopped for lunch at this little gem. The food was excellent, home made , delicious and good value. Brigette was very friendly and we had a nice chat about the area. I hope we will be able to stop again next time we are in Hereford",Date of visit: February 2017,The Harewood End Inn,4,"Harewood End, United Kingdom"
"Very disappointed, not worth it by a long way","If you want to feel expoited and unwelcome ,then this is the place for you. The New Old Synagogue is the oldest in Prague and maybe Europe so it is historically important, but at 200 Koruna per person it is very poor value. All there is to see a single basement celar room with no artifacts, just a central altar. I paid 540 Koruna for a family ticket which is the same as the entry fee to the Castle. To add insult to injury the toilet nearby is 50% more fees charged than most places in Prague.",Date of experience: August 2016,The Old-New Synagogue,4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
"Excellent, the perfect place to stay","Stayed here with family and friends. The hotel is comfortable and clean, staff are friendly and helpful, breakfast is very nice and the location is great for getting to the sights. Can't fault it in any way",Date of stay: August 2016,Hotel Julian,4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
Great way to spend an hour with the kids,A visit to Nottingham is not complete without a trip to the caves. The guided tour made the experience all the more interesting,Date of experience: February 2016,City of Caves,4,"Nottingham, United Kingdom"
