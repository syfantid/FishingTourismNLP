A perfect experience,"The trip felt like visiting local friends from start to finish! We booked the trip because we wanted a bit more private experience, and the 10 people trip was exactly what we were looking for. When we went to book the trip and met Giannis and Nancy we already knew it will be awesome, and the day itself could not have been better. From the start Giannis told us to make ourselves at home and think the of boat as our own. We saw dolphins, caught a lot of fish and calamari too, Nancy cooked them for us (food was perfect!) and we got to swim and drink and laugh the whole day. Thank you so much!",Date of experience: August 2019,Samos Fishing Trips,3,"Samos, Greece"
Nice enough,"A good place to meet people. On the other hand, the staff puts on the music at 11am really loud, like nightclub-loud. When asked to turn the music down a bit, the staff were a bit offended and turned it up again in 15mins when their favorite song came up... Really difficult to actually get to know the people you meet, when you can't hear anything in the lounge area between 11am to 11pm... Other thing, if you plan on staying here on the rainy season, be prepared to get a natural shower going to the bathroom, climbing the stairs, eating your breakfast etc.. The whole hostel leaks big time.
That said, I did enjoy my stay here, mainly because of the other travellers I met. The facilities are definitely not good, but a true backpacker can manage.",Date of stay: January 2016,Gili La Boheme,3,"Gili Trawangan, Indonesia"
