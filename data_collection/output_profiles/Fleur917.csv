Very Mediocre Service but a pretty restaurant,"This is a very pretty restaurant and we were excited to be there as soon as we sat down. The food is good. We had stuffed zucchini flowers which were delicious. However, the service was really poor. We sat without menus for about ten minutes. We didn't have any napkins on the table. We were pretty much non-existent to the staff. We asked for water. We watched as another table got water. We didn't get any water. As the evening went on the service became slower and worse. The staff simply didn't seem to care that we were there. I would say, try this restaurant but be prepared for the service possibly not being on point. It was a pretty disappointing experience overall.",Date of visit: June 2019,Peskesi,4,"Crete, Greece"
Wonderful view and great service,"Amphora Restaurant has a great location, just along the water. We were advised to avoid restaurants along the water as they could be more touristy and lack in quality but Amphora was great and definitely the right choice for our last evening in Chania. There was only one table available and we wanted to sit by the water so we asked if there anything by the water might open up soon. We ended up taking the one remaining table that was a bit further in. A few minutes after we sat down a wonderful table opened up. Several waiters came over to tell us and we were moved to a bigger table with a view. They could easily have let us sit where we were and saved the table with a view for another passerby but they gave it to us instead without us even asking to be moved. The food was very good and we were given some absolutely delicious chocolate cake for dessert. Another wonderful, welcoming and memorable experience in Chania.",Date of visit: June 2019,Amphora Restaurant,4,"Crete, Greece"
A fun and tasty dinner,"We went to Tamam based on reviews and recommendations from locals. We made a reservation, I would recommend doing the same, especially if you want to sit outside. The food was very good, as was the service. Our waiter made some suggestions to tweak our choices when we were ordering and he was definitely right. We tried a variety of dishes that were all very good and fresh. We sat outside which made it a fun and lively dinner. Outdoor seating is on the narrow street in front of the restaurant so the people and visitors of Chania pass you by as you eat. If you prefer something more private and roomier, outside may not be for you. We enjoyed it though. What I really appreciated was that although there were people waiting for tables we were never rushed and in fact we had to ask for the bill, so there was no pressure for us to leave. Once we were seated the table was ours for as long as we wanted. The menu is interesting and a little bit different than some of the other restaurants. There are certainly traditional dishes but there are also some variations made on them that allows Tamam to set itself apart.",Date of visit: June 2019,Tamam Restaurant,4,"Crete, Greece"
Wonderful Location!,"Amphora Hotel is perfectly located if you want to be in Chania Harbor. We stayed in Room 20 with a terrace and beautiful views. (It's worth the walk up). The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. All we had to do was step outside to experience Chania. All the staff members were very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was traditional and tasty. We received coffee and fresh squeezed juice before being able to choose from items such as fresh yogurt, olives, cheese and Greek specialties. We also ate dinner at the restaurant downstairs on our last night and it was a lovely meal with a wonderful atmosphere. I would definitely return to Amphora for the views and the warm welcome alone. We hope to come back to Room 20's balcony again soon.",Date of stay: June 2019,Amphora Hotel,4,"Crete, Greece"
A unique adventure with Nasos!,"Nasos is the best guide you could ask for. For a whole day we were in Nasos' very capable hands and didn't have to think about a thing as he took us from experience to experience. If you want to disconnect and get off the beaten path, this is the tour for you. After treating us to mountain tea and traditional Cretan cheese, Nasos took us into the mountains to see the metato. He is so knowledgeable and passionate so it is a pleasure to listen to him. He told us about the shepherds, Cretan cheese, olives, bees and Greek history. We came away from the tour feeling like we had experienced something unique and had learned more about the landscape that makes Greek food so delicious. This is a true learning experience and a bit of an adventure at the same time. It's a wonderful opportunity to get to know Crete a bit better. Nasos is very well organized, knowledgeable, safety conscious and determined to have his guests have a wonderful experience. He really goes abobe and beyond. Spend the day with Nasos!",Date of experience: June 2019,Semi Private Jeep Safari Tour - Visit a Shepherd's Hut,4,"Crete, Greece"
Beyond Amazing!,"I can't say enough wonderful things about this experience. Everything was beyond our expectations. Anthi is amazing! She is so knowledgeable and kind. She made sure to check in with everyone and give each person attention to create a really lovely atmosphere. Her crew is wonderful as well. We were able to do it all. We watched as the crew brought up shrimp, fish and octopus, all of which they cooked to provide us with a delicious dinner. We were then able to swim, fish, eat, drink and watch the sunset in a beautiful setting. Everything you could need is on board including towels and snorkeling equipment. We were so glad that we got away from the crowds on Santorini and had a really unique experience. It is worth every penny, don't miss this experience.This was one of the best experiences we have had and we can’t wait to come back and do it again. Thank you so much for a beautiful and unforgettable day!",Date of experience: June 2019,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
More than Amazing,I can't imagine there being a better place to get married. The experience we had was perfect in every way. Rylan and Milli helped us create a wedding that was beyond our expectations. We received so much help and guidance along the way. We really couldn't have done it without them. Latrobe's is a beautiful and truly special place.,Date of visit: September 2016,Latrobe's On Royal,4,"New Orleans, Louisiana"
Great Italian Restaurant!,"We went to Cotto for my mother's birthday in August and they did everything possible to make it a special night. They started by giving us each a glass of sparkling wine, which was a very nice touch. The food was delicious and well priced, the ambiance was cozy but chic. The service was very good as well. The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. We really had a nice time and are looking forward to going back soon.",Date of visit: August 2015,Cotto Winebar & Pizzeria,4,"Stamford, Connecticut"
Great Hotel,"This is a great hotel, very clean, modern and comfortable. It has a lovely atmosphere. The staff is excellent. They were all very helpful, going above and beyond what we have experienced at any other hotel we have stayed at before. Before our arrival I emailed them several times for advice and suggestions about restaurants and transportation. They were all so helpful. They made reservations and arranged transportation for us during our stay. The staff helped make our stay in Malta relaxing and easy. The hotel is quiet and very conveniently located. Breakfast is great as well. We will definitely stay here again when we return to beautiful Malta.",Date of stay: May 2015,Hotel Valentina,4,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Amazing Restaurant - A wonderful experience,This was one of our greatest dining experiences. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious. We had a delicious octopus dish that was one of the best we had while in Malta. Our server Andrea was so nice. He told us a lot about Malta and gave us great suggestions about additional things to see and do. The restaurant is cozy and intimate. Go here for a special meal and experience.,Date of visit: May 2015,Wigi's Kitchen,4,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Amazing Adventure,"We took a day cruise to Comino with Seahorse Cruises in May. The crew was extremely professional and very friendly. They ensured we had a great and safe day. It was very windy so it was a more challenging cruise for the crew, but they handled it wonderfully. The style of the boat made it more fun and adventurous than if we had taken a more standard ferry type boat. It's not for everyone though as it can be choppy and you can get wet sitting on the deck. We made sure to continuously apply sunblock while quite a few other people turned into lobsters so I suggest bringing a lot of strong sunblock as well as towels to make sure you have a comfortable day. We went in May and as it was windy it got chilly so if you go off-season, bring a sweatshirt. There was food and drinks on board that was also very good and well priced. We had an absolutely wonderful day. Seahorse picked us up an dropped us off at our hotel, making the whole experience convenient and easy. If you want an authentic, adventurous and really fun day, take a seahorse cruise, you won't regret it.",Date of experience: May 2015,Seahorse Cruises,4,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Great Day Trip,"We spent a wonderful day driving through the English countryside with Chris. He went above and beyond all day to make not only the tour, but our whole experience in England, wonderful. The secret place was a lot of fun and a great choice as well. Chris didn't just drop us off at various points as other tour guides do, but he took the time to give suggestions about places to visit and educated us about what we were about to see. Our day with the English Bus was not only fun but also a chance to learn about the country. The company is very professional, well organized and delivers on all it promises.",Date of experience: July 2014,The English Bus,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Very Fun and Informative Experience,"This was such an interesting and fun experience. Sylvia talked about Iceland, the brewery, and beer and had EVERYONE laughing hysterically the whole time. It looked like everyone was a having an absolutely wonderful time as they drank beer and listened to Sylvia's stories. You will not only get to try A LOT of beer on this tour but you will most definitely learn something about Iceland. I'm so glad we went on the tour and would recommend it to anyone who wants to sit back, listen and enjoy some beer.",Date of experience: March 2014,Olgerdin Brewery Tour,4,"Reykjavik, Iceland"
Wonderful Tour of the South Shore with Alpert,"We took the South Shore Tour and had a wonderful experience. Our guide, Alpert, was probably the best tour guide we've ever had on any tour. He went above and beyond the whole day to make sure that everyone had a great experience. Alpert taught us so much about Iceland as he shared stories, facts and anecdotes throughout the day. He not only made the scheduled stops but made a few surprise ones as well. While Alpert clearly wanted to show and teach our small group as much as possible, our safety was his main concern. He is not only a great guide but also a good driver as he took us back to Reykjavik in treacherous weather. Renting a car and just driving to the south just wouldn't have been the same. Alpert's expert information and tips made the experience truly great. We had a wonderful experience and can't wait to take another one of GeoIceland's tours.",Date of experience: March 2014,GeoIceland Day Tours,4,"Reykjavik, Iceland"
Giants Causeway Tour,"This was probably one of the best days of our trip. We saw so many beautiful sites along the drive and our driver was a phenomenal guide. He told us so much about Irish history, especially the conflict in Northern Ireland. The bus was comfortable and the stops were timed perfectly. I felt like this was a wonderful learning experience and a great way to see some of the Irish countryside. The rope bridge and the Giants Causeway were unforgettable stops on a great day.",Date of experience: May 2013,Irish Day Tours,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
Wonderful Dinner,"We had a wonderful dinner here, probably one of the best ever. The women who run the place are very nice and helpful. They made great recommendations for wine and food. The tiramisu for dessert was phenomenal!! This is a great little restaurant with a lot history, really good food and friendly service.",Date of visit: May 2013,Fiaschetteria Beltramme,4,"Rome, Italy"
Fun tour and a great learning experience,"We took this tour on our short visit in May. Our tour guide Andy was great. He was so knowledgeable about the city and history in general. We learned so much during this two hour walking tour. It gave us a whole new appreciation of Edinburgh and made us love the city even more. This is a great tour to take. It allows you to orient yourself a bit and also gives you the foundation to explore other places or aspects of the city. Take this tour, it's fun and a great way to spend a morning or afternoon in Edinburgh.",Date of experience: May 2013,SANDEMANs NEW Europe - Edinburgh,4,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Great Informative Tour,"We went on the free walking tour in the morning and had such a great experience that we wanted to try another walking tour. This tour was recommended to us as one that is more historical and informative and that's exactly what we were looking for. If you're looking for a corny ghost tour where things jump out at you this is not it. This is a fun and really intelligently written and led tour. There wasn't a borning moment to be had. We found out a lot of additional information about Edinbugh. Our tour guide was Eoin who, as mentioned in other reviews, is a great storyteller. It was pouring rain and he still managed to lead a great tour all while not even wearing a rain jacket and getting presumably soaked. This is a tour for anyone who wants to know more about Edinburgh and see some interesting views as well. We were able to walk to some sites that we hadn't gotten to on our own yet all while hearing some really interesting and even creepy stories. Take this tour if you want a little something different and learn more about this great city. Remember to bring a rain jacket if there's even a hint of rain, it will make your experience more enjoyable.",Date of experience: May 2013,SANDEMANs NEW Europe - Edinburgh,4,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Great Way to Experience Capri,"I emailed back and forth with Gianni before our trip. He was great at replying and answering my questions. We stayed in Positano and took the ferry over to Capri to meet Gianni at the scheduled time. I have to say it was nice to have had it set up in advance and know that we were dealing with professionals. When we got to Capri there were people offering to take us on boat rides but I really feel like Gianni and his family were the way to go. They are professional, warm, welcoming and accommodating. I felt like we were in good hands.
My family and I took a 3 hour tour with Gianni's father Antonio. We had a wonderful and unforgettable time. It made our trip so memorable and fun. We had a relaxing boat ride and got to see Capri from the water. Antonio chose a spot to anchor the boat and we had a chance to go swimming in the beautiful blue water, what an experience!
Antonio was a great captain and guide. He is very personable and shared little tidbits with us along the way.
Relaxing, fun, special and well worth the time!!
If you like boats I highly recommend taking one of Gianni's boats.",Date of experience: July 2012,Gianni's Boat,4,"Island of Capri, Italy"
Not Easy But Worth It,"Everyone advised to climb the steps so I dragged my boyfriend to the Bell Tower and we climbed to the top. It wasn't easy though I'm young and somewhat fit. We were lucky it wasn't very crowded so we didn't have to deal with people coming the other way too often (you take the same way up and down). It gets a little claustrophobic and tight towards the top but it's worth the effort. The view of many sights in Florence, the red roofs that spread out into the distance, the top of the Duomo straight across and last but not least the sense of accomplishment from climbing the steps (you'll understand when you experience it), are all there to greet you at the top. Probably one of my favorite stops on a long trip to many different places.
Other than drinking plenty of water my only other tip would be to be encouraging to those going up. I heard some people laughing as they said, ""you're not even close"" to an already tired looking group on their way up. Cheer them on, don't tear them down before they even get half way to the top.",Date of experience: July 2012,Campanile di Giotto,4,"Florence, Italy"
Awesome,"Again, this was one of the sites that many people highly recommended, so I went. It's in the Academia and is displayed in a really beautiful way. The setting allows for many people to view the David without the crowds being overwhelming. You enter and are truly struck by this enormous, beautiful sculpture. I'm not a sculpture aficionado but there is something very special about seeing the David. It doesn't take long and is definitely worth visiting. Go if you can! P.S. With the Firenze Card you can skip the line.",Date of experience: July 2012,Galleria dell'Accademia,4,"Florence, Italy"
Enormous and Very Interesting,"The Basilica di Santa Croce is very large but peaceful as well. It's a special experience to see the tombs of Michelangelo, Machiavelli, Dante, etc. It really makes you realize how old the Basilica and the city are. Michelangelo's tomb is very nice in particular and some beautiful sculptures surrounding it. When we unintentionally arrived half an hour before closing the person at the ticket counter warned me and asked if it was ok. I thought it was fine but once inside I realized it would have been nice to have been able to spend some more time there. It's nice to take your time, absorb your surroundings and enjoy a little bit of serenity and quiet.",Date of experience: July 2012,Basilica of Santa Croce,4,"Florence, Italy"
A GREAT Experience,"After reading a lot of reviews on trip advisor I decided to book a Golden Circle Tour with Iceland Horizon. I corresponded with David a few times before the tour and he always responded very quickly, answering all my questions. We happened to arrive in Iceland the day after their biggest snow storm in many, many years so unfortunately the day our tour was scheduled we couldn't go because many roads were closed. I ony mention this because David came to our hotel in person to explain the situation and tell us of our options. We appreciated his effort and honesty very much. David arranged for a colleague, Lulli, to take us on the tour the next day. WE LOVED Lulli, we couldn't ask for a nicer, more enthusiastic guide. I highly recommend seeing the Golden Circle with Iceland Horizon, they will definitely do all they can to ensure you have a great time seeing the beautiful sights of Iceland while sharing a lot of interesting details about Iceland along the trip. At the end of the tour Lulli said that Iceland is a small country with a big heart and we certainly learned that firsthand!!",Date of experience: January 2012,Iceland Horizon,4,"Reykjavik, Iceland"
Great Fun Drinks,"The Swedish inspired menu is very good. The choices aren’t overwhelming but if you like fish, especially salmon you’ll definitely find something to pick. If you just want a burger, they have that on the menu too. I would recommend the gravlax the mussels, or if you’re feeling adventurous, the herring tasting plate. The french fries are great too if you like thin ones.
This place is especially great in the summer when you can sit outside and try their fun drinks that have lingonberry, aquavit, st. Germain, bourbon, you name it, in them to create really delicious flavors.
A lot of fun and something a little different.",Date of visit: July 2011,Smorgas Chef,4,"New York City, New York"
