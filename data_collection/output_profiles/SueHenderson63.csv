Summer holiday with family,i have stayed at this hotel numerous times and won't stay anywhere else in Skala. I saw the one star review by Carigana and cannot understand their comments.

Holiday flight to kefalonia,Family holiday to Kefalonia flew with Thomas Cook. Excellent flight and excellent service. I pre booked our seats and did online check in which made the check in very quick and smooth. I also paid for fast track security so quickly passed through passport control. Meal on flight was very good. Flight took off a few minutes late due to problems at Kefalonia however pilot made up the time and we arrived on time. Price was more than I usually pay to Kefalonia however it was August and in school holidays.,Date of travel: August 2018,Thomas Cook Airlines (UK) [no longer operating],4,World
A great day out,"A wonderful day out with Efi & Dimitrios, a working fishing boat where you help (if you want to) to bring in the fishing nets with Dimitrios. But so much more, they then take you off to a quiet bay where you can have a swim or walk along a beach while Efi cooks you a delicious lunch, usually all the different fish they have just caught. Back onto the boat for lunch and then another quiet bay for more swimming. Only small boat maximum people 8-10, it was full with all my family so felt even more special, like a totally private hire. Efi & Dimitirios are such lovely people, very friendly and although we were strangers when we got on board, I definitely now would call them friends. Can't wait til next year and our next trip.",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fabulous hotel and fabulous staff,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful and is in a lovey valley setting with beautiful views all around. The owner, Alan, was great. We were suppose to stay a week earlier but because of snow Alan called me at home and suggested changing to this week, which turned out to be an excellent idea as weather much better and was able to get out walking with my dog more. Alan was very welcoming and always seemed interested in whether we had had a nice day. He even suggested places to visit and printed off information and directions for us, definitely going the extra mile! All the staff at the hotel from Alan, John, the ladies in the restaurant and even housekeeping, were very friendly and genuinely were looking to please, they couldn't do enough for us. The food is fabulous, well done to the chef and his team. We only had one evening meal but it was delicious and very good value for money. Breakfast was included and I don't think they could have offered you anything more. Excellent selection and Alan's cooked breakfasts will last you all day!! We stayed in a delux room and it was superb, they even left out a little bag of treats for Rosie my dog. Complimentary tea and coffee, to the point where you had a full jar of coffee and a full pint of milk in your room! Dogs welcome if keep on a lead and under control, understandably. The staff not only made a fuss of us they also made a fuss of Rosie and I never once felt uncomfortable in the hotel with my dog. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone but perhaps not those with young unruly children!!!! Will definitely return and am looking forward to my next visit. Thank you Alan, you have a wonderful hotel and a wonderful team working for you, keep it up!!!!",Date of stay: March 2018,The Mulberry Inn,4,"Llwynmawr, United Kingdom"
21st birthday treat to Paris for my daughter,"Can't recommend this hotel enough, small and friendly and in a central location with good access to most sites. Staff were super friendly especially Alain, Gregory and Jobi. Stayed in a delux double room that was clean and lovely with a decent view. The staff went out of their way to ensure that my daughter enjoyed her birthday and made our trip very special. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and recommend to others if you are looking for a small boutique friendly place to stay. Well done to Gwen and her team.",Date of stay: October 2017,HÃ´tel Villa Lafayette Paris 9,4,"Paris, France"
Short midweek break with my partner and our dogs.,"Booked a little midweek break with my partner and our two dogs. Groes Inn lovely place, oldie worldie and lots of character. Staff were super friendly and very helpful and the good was terrific. Upgraded to delux room so we had a terrace for the dogs and it was lovely. Used the inn as a base so we could visit lots of different places in north wales.",Date of stay: March 2017,Groes Inn,4,"Tyn-y-Groes, United Kingdom"

Holiday meal,"This is the oldest taverna in Skala, a family run business with wonderful food. Been coming here for many years and never had a meal that I didn't enjoy. Home cooking with friendly staff who are always welcoming. It's always a pleasure to eat here.",Date of visit: June 2016,Sirocco,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Summer holiday with grown family,"Superb hotel with welcoming and helpful staff. Rooms are large and well equipped and cleaned daily. Bar meals are home cooked, make sure you try the daily specials. Excellent pool and bar with staff only too please to make your stay enjoyable, nothing is too much trouble. Hotel location on beach front only a few minutes walk into Skala village for tavernas, shops and bars. This was my 14th year visiting Skala and at least my 5th or 6th stay at the Anassa. Feels like visiting friends.",Date of stay: June 2016,Anassa Hotel,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Summer holiday,Beautiful beachside bar run by Makis and his brother Spiros. Lovely location and made to feel very welcome,Date of visit: June 2016,Metaxa Beach Bar,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Weekend stay,"Booked a double room for myself and sister whilst visiting an elderly relative nearby. Castle was very nice although in need of a little TLC. No specific reception area so wondered around a bit before we found anyone to check in. Rooms were satisfactory although no plug near mirror caused a little inconvenience. Ate in the restaurant and drank in bar, food nice but no background music or mood lighting. No music in bar, felt a little like a library, so quiet didn't feel like you should talk. Tended to be only 2 members of staff at any one time and whilst Gary and Laura were lovely and made our stay enjoyable, they are definitely overworked, having to do a bit of everything. Would definitely stay here again.",Date of stay: June 2016,Broomhall Castle,4,"Menstrie, United Kingdom"
