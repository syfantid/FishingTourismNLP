Food and staff excellent,"We stayed in Chocolate Heaven and Gin Room, recently refurbished. Great rooms and dog friendly albeit chocolate room slightly smaller than had hoped and right on the road level and wasn't double glazed",Date of stay: November 2019,The Wensleydale Heifer,5,"West Witton, United Kingdom"
Best day of our holiday!,"We had the most amazing day with Dimitris. 8 of us ranging from 17-50+++

We swam, snorkeled, sunbathed and ate the most wonderful food prepared by Dimitris.

It was a full day from 10.30-7.30pm and would recommend the trip to anyone!

Thank you Dimitris",Date of experience: August 2019,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
