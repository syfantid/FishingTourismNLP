Great day with Captain Nikolas and Captain Artemis,"Took my 9 year old son for a day of fishing with Nikolas and Artemis. They were gracious, fun, accommodating and super friendly. They gave us a lot of background on Mykonos and took us out for a great day of fishing, swimming and eating. It was a treat to spend the day with two of them. Nikolas cooked up a bunch of the fish with some other local food and made a fantastic meal. Artemis cleaned a large amount of fish for us to take home as well which we ate the next night.",Date of experience: June 2019,Captain Nikolas,5,"Mykonos, Greece"
Wish we had booked to stay longer,"When booking a trip to the Greek Islands, we wanted to try an island other than Santorini or Mykonos. We opted for Naxos and stayed at Valea Villa. The home was beautiful and well maintained. There was a fruit bowl and pound cake upon arrival. All of the amenities were included to get you started, from shampoo and conditioner, coffee, and bottled water. They do a great job of checking in without being intrusive. The children loved swimming in the pool and there was a parking spot available for a rental car. There were multiple balconies overlooking the Aegean Sea. The beach was close and a small village walking distance for food and restaurants. We only stayed 3 nights. I wish we had planned a longer visit. We usually don't go back to the same place twice, but we will be back to Naxos and I would definitely stay at Valea Villa again!",Date of stay: June 2019,Valea Villa Naxos with Private Swiimming Pool,5,"Naxos, Greece"
Full day trip from Athens,"I would like to thank George with Visit Meteora Travel for the excellent tour of Meteora and the organization of the tour from Athens. His love of the region and deep knowledge of history and culture was infectious. The backdrop of Meteora was breathtaking. The only disappointment was that we only allotted one day, in retrospect at least three to four days in the area is the minimum needed to explore this area. We will be back for a hiking tour and will definitely contact George again to arrange.",,Meteora Monasteries Full Day Private Tour,5,"Kalambaka, Greece"
Multiple visits,Great sorbets and gelatos and service! My favorites were the lemon and orange sorbet. Hugs are free!,Date of visit: June 2019,Lolita's Gelato,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Cruise around the Caldera,"The experience with Captain Mario and his first mate, Nancy lived up to all the 5 star ratings. Fantastic experience - the hospitality, the conversation, the food and drinks , the cruising - all excellent. They were super accommodating to my entire family - wife, 3 kids (16, 13 and 9) and my 75+ year old mother in law.

Best seafood saganaki ever!",Date of experience: June 2019,Barbarossa Sailing,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Awesome,"We took the 30 minute Arches Back Country trip with my 15 year old daughter and 8 year old son. Just short of returning to the airport, we ran into a little bit of unexpected weather so the pilot hovered for a while to let it pass and return us safely. Well it did not, so we landed in a field while the owner came to get us and drove us back into town. The trip was fantastic, views incredible, pilot engaged and we had finished our half an hour; but because the owner perceived us as being inconvenienced, he refunded the entire trip. I insisted that we pay, they still refunded. Class act. Great business. Strongly recommend.",Date of experience: June 2018,Pinnacle Helicopters,5,"Moab, Utah"
Great Day!,"I went here with my parents (70+) and my child 8. Our guide was Jess and everything was fantastic. I read through all the comments prior to going and my concerns were that it was going to be child un-friendly and that there would not be sufficient food. None of those concerns were founded, all the staff was super accommodating and attentive to the young ones (there were also two infants and a 3-4 year old on the trip). And the food, plenty of it and delicious. The extra treat was cracking macadamia nuts and eating fresh avocado, coffee beans and fresh fruit from trees. Remember to bring wine or beer to enjoy with your meal.",Date of experience: March 2018,O'o Farm,5,"Maui, Hawaii"
Awesome. Six stars!,"I can't say enough positive things about this trip. We did the full day All the Way Around trip with my parents (70+) and child 8. Haley was our guide. I won't reiterate what is in most of these reviews but all the positives were our experience as well.

A couple things I would like to add are I appreciated Haley's candor and professionalism as well as her knowledge and appreciation of Hawai'ian language, culture and history.

I also wanted to convey my deepest appreciation for their post trip actions. We lost a bag on the trip somewhere and it was turned into the Hana PD by someone, it contained some rather important items; Gustavo (one of the owners) picked up my stuff from Hana within the next few days and Jasmine (the other owner) has arranged to have it sent to me back on the mainland.",Date of experience: March 2018,Holo Holo Maui Tours,5,"Maui, Hawaii"
Great experience.,"Though we did not fly (weather did not accommodate), I want to commend the professionalism and integrity Nate brought to this experience.

Firstly, we booked late and did not give Nate many options in dates/times, he managed to make our date/time work.

The morning we were supposed to fly, the weather looked socked in and he called to say we were not safely allowed to fly; however, we may be able to do it an hour or two later than scheduled time. He called back a few hors later to inform us that we could safely fly but the trip wouldn't be as memorable as a lot of the valleys with the waterfalls might still be cloudy. He basically said, if the experience is just to get in a helicopter, go; however, if you want the real experience, save it for another time. I appreciated his candor, integrity and honesty and giving us an honest assessment and not taking us and wasting our money.",Date of experience: March 2018,"Pacific Helicopter Tours, Inc",5,"Maui, Hawaii"
2 Day tour with Mr. Khem,Excellent. Could not recommend any higher. Mr. Khem had a very easy going personality and very deep knowledge and passion for Siem Reap and the Khmer history. I thoroughly enjoyed his tour and company.,Date of experience: November 2015,Happy Angkor Tour,5,"Siem Reap, Cambodia"
Food Tour with Barney - Hoi An,"I took a solo morning food tour with Barney. This tour was quite good. We stayed largely out of the main tourist area and visited a smaller (more local) market. Barney was very knowledgable and accomodating and made the tour both interesting and tasty. We also walked through neighborhoods and he gave me some historical perspective as well as perspective on the daily lives of the people who lived there. Barney also summarized the tour on the map, gave me a few more suggestions of places to eat and recommended good places to buy coffee (to bring back to the US). Excellent, thank you very much.",Date of experience: November 2015,Hoi An Food Safari Tours,5,"Hoi An, Vietnam"
So Full! In a good way!,"Van runs the best cooking class that I have been to. Well organized, lots of hands on work (but has staff to help if you want it), lots of selection. We had 12 of us in the tour and after a visit to the market and a Ca Phe Sua Da stop we went to Van's house to cook. Each of us selected a dish, we then went to the market and purchased fresh meat/produce to prepare the dish. We all prepped our food together and then one by one we cooked our dish and we all sampled it. It was unbelievably good. I wish there were 6 stars to give!",Date of experience: November 2015,Green Bamboo Cooking School & Cafe,5,"Hoi An, Vietnam"
3D2N Tu Lan Cave,"Awesome experience, even better than I thought. Everything was thought out, organized and detailed. Guides (Bamboo - Toan and King) were excellent as were Hill and the other porters. The guides had great knowledge of the area, funny anecdotes and were always engaging the clients (8 of us in total).

The scenery, the caves, the multiple activities (swimming, hiking, caving) were awesome as well as the commitment to safety the company had.

Looking forward to doing Son Doong with Oxalis in the future.",Date of experience: November 2015,Oxalis Adventure,5,"Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park, Vietnam"
Food tour with Hien (Cherry),"Hien was an excellent guide for the tour. We sampled a wide variety of street foods in the old quarter and she was great at explaining how it was prepared, the ingredients and the origins of the dish. Of the eight or so places we went all of the food was great, especially green papaya salad and the egg coffee.

As I was getting full and we were winding down the tour, I asked her suggestions for BBQ and Grilled pork Banh Mi, she named a few places which I tried the next day, they too, were excellent.

Highly suggest the tour, especially with Hien (Cherry).",Date of experience: November 2015,Hanoi Street Food Tour,5,"Hanoi, Vietnam"
