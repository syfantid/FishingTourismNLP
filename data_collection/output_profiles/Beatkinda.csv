One of the best days of our trip!!,"Thanks Froso and Captain Niko! We had a really lovely time as a group of four on the boat. Probably the day we talk about most -- wonderful hospitality, food, and swimming. We felt the love and dedication from our hosts and have never seen such blue water. They did almost all the fishing, so if you want to spend a day on a boat having good conversation and eating well and seeing some of Milos' hidden gems, this is the way to go. Can't thank you enough or rate you high enough!",Date of experience: May 2018,Milos Fishing Experience,5,"Milos, Greece"
