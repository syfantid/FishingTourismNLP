"Been twice, WILL GO AGAIN!","I’ve been on this boat trip twice now with family and friends and I never intend to stop going on it! Each trip is so different and unique that it’s worth doing it over and over again. The trip starts with some coffee and tea on the boat, then we go and pull up the fishing nets. Then we find a nice exclusive bay and eat there! We went to two bays in the trip I did a couple days ago however, the first where we swam, and the second where we swam and ate our catch! The staff are very nice and warm and provide an amazing experience. Some people are out off by the fact it is a ‘fishing trip’. IT IS NOT!! Yes you do some fishing and pull up the nets but it is full of other activities as well! These include swimming and eating an amazing fresh lunch. I highly recommend as there is nothing else on the island that can beat this. Yes, go visit the Melissani caves... but this is far better. I cannot stress how great this trip is.",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great as always!,"My family is fortunate enough to have a house on this island, and therefore we know of a lot of places around here. Petani, however, is one of our favourites. The food in the restaurant above the beach is also amazing. Matched with an incredible view, the beach is beautiful.",Date of experience: July 2019,Petani Beach,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best restaurant ever,The Milos taverna has also been great. The staff are incredibly friendly and the food is amazing. I have been there a few times now and it still remains as one of my favourite places on the island! I highly recommend a visit there!,Date of visit: July 2019,Milos Taverna,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great atmosphere,We’ve been coming to kefalonia for years now and the bass cafe has never let us down! The atmosphere is great and the cafe is very open.

Great for anytime!,"I went yesterday with my sister for some lunch and it was great. It wasn’t busy so we had a great selection of seats.

Great theatre!,"I recently went to see ‘the girl on the train’ with my family and it was amazing, the stage and seating was great. Before that I was actually in a play there and the theatre is an amazing place. I really recommend you going there to see anything! It’s great and highly recommended.",Date of experience: July 2019,Oxford Playhouse,4,"Oxford, United Kingdom"

Great visit!,"We came for a family lunch with my wheel chair bound granny! The staff where extremely friendly and the food was great! I had the all day breakfast (small) which was huge! An overall great stay. The pub provides great space and is very open which adds to its good atmosphere.
I would give 5 stars but we were sat among 3 very interested-in-what-we-were-doing people...",Date of visit: July 2019,The Three Horseshoes,4,"Henley-on-Thames, United Kingdom"
The best place for bubble tea,"This bubble tea shop is by far the best of its kind. With many drinks to choose from - including milk teas, fruit tea etc. - you can also customise the ice level and sugar level (be it 50% or 120%). This place is amazing and I most definitely recommend chocolate milk tea as it is amazing!! Also the lemon black tea!",Date of visit: July 2019,Chatime,4,"Oxford, United Kingdom"
Great! Highly recommended!,We walked in and the staff instantly complemented my mums appearance which was very warming. We then got to pick our table and were sat choosing our meals in no time! We came as it was my grandmother’s birthday and we were extremely satisfied with our meal. Very highly recommended and will return.

Very good service and THOUSANDS of flavours!,"I have never been to a better milkshake place! I went for the first time ever with my friends the other day and I had (after about a year choosing) and areo mint milkshake... wait, that’s not exotic enough for you? Well, how about a haribo milkshake! Or anything you can think of... look at the picture attached to see the full menu!!!!!!!

"Great hotel, very convenient","We arrived at the hotel and, without fuss, got our room key and 2 free bus tickets to get anywhere -the airport in the morning and Geneva in the evening. We got to our room and it was great! We then got a bus into Geneva and ate there - there is a restaurant/cafe at the hotel we just chose to eat in Geneva! Later, we got the bus back to the hotel and sat in the cafe/restaurant for an hour and had a few drinks! Woke up in the morning and chose to walk the 10 min walk to the airport, great stay!",Date of stay: February 2019,Ibis Budget Geneve Aeroport,4,"Cointrin, Switzerland"
Ski holiday! (At the best hotel),Best hotel stay ever! I’m 14 and this hotel has been great. The food is amazing and there is plenty of it! Breakfast buffet is delicious and the staff are the most friendly people you will ever meet! This hotel is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Easy access to all slopes and the town of Chamonix is a walking distance away! They even have a warm room for customers to put there wet ski gear in! Great stay and will definitely return!!
