Beautiful Read in the corner of Medina,"We stayed at a few places during our trip in Morocco and this was by far our favourite.

Beautiful decor and rooms, heated floors and luxurious bathrooms. Youssef was very accommodating (but not over the top, which we found to be a bit much in other Riads) Breakfast was delicious, and service was excellent and quick.

Lovely stay. Thank you Youssef and the rest of the team!",Date of stay: March 2020,Dar Maya,5,"Essaouira, Morocco"
Fantastic place with drinks and music,"Very friendly service, great food + wine and beer (which isn't always easy to find) Very close to Medina. Fantastic music.

We had dinner there and caught a bit of the live music, so good. Wish we could have stayed longer.

They ran out of their salmon pasta (since it's all fresh etc) but made a seafood one just for us (with other ingredients) that was delicious.

Bonus is that it's open all day. It was hard to find a good dinner spot for early dinner since a lot of places open at 7-8.

This place checks off everything you'd want - great food, great ambience, friendly service, drinks, reasonable prices, live music, great location. Couldn't ask for anything else.

Thank you!",Date of visit: March 2020,D'jazy Essaouira,5,"Essaouira, Morocco"
Amazing experience,"My husband and I did a sunset fishing trip back in 2018 and I've been thinking about writing a review ever since. It was a fantastic experience. We try do some sort of fishing on all of our travels and this was by far the best one yet! It was different from most fishing trips with less focus on casting and catching fish, and felt way more authentic.

I felt like I joined a bunch of fishermen (and women) for a day of fishing, which is just the vibe we were looking for. We caught a whole bunch of different species including a few octopus and lots of shrimp. All of this made for the most delicious dinner. I still dream about that shrimp!

We got to do our own casting as well, go swimming and help out with the nets etc. as much as we wanted to. My husband was fully involved in the whole process, while I enjoined watching it all with a drink in hand.

We also had a great group of people on this trip (a bunch of couples around our age) so that was icing on the cake.

The best part was our captain Anthi. She went above and beyond to make sure everythig was running smoothly. I have so much respect for what she does and hope this turns into a very successful business for her.

10/10 in every way. Thank you Anthi. 2.5 years later and we still talk about that trip as best one yet.
