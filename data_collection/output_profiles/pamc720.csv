Superb Private Boat Trip,"Arranged private trip for four via email from UK having read previous trip adviser reviews. Peter responded to each email quickly, answering all questions fully. Arranged to meet on beach at Royalton when we arrived so Peter could advise of the pick up time on 03/11/19 & details of the day. Gave a deposit so Peter could buy drinks.
We met another couple at the resort who we asked to join us, making a total of six adults (boat can take up to 12 people, but I think this might be a bit of a squeeze).
This reduced the cost from $150 each to $125. Peter advised of this reduction without us asking, which to me shows real honesty as he could have still charged $150 each.
The cost included all entrance fees to waterfall & drive in volcano/ mud baths, plus the land transport to/from the waterfall & drive in volcano / mud baths. Lunch was extra.
Beer, water, soft drink & rum punch included in price. Could have done with more rum punch as it did run out.
We had a full day from 9am, arriving back at the hotel beach 4.30ish.
The day was ours to spend as we wanted with Peters suggestions.
The boat had cover if needed. We had it down most of the time, especially on way back so we could go faster, which was great fun.
Sights included some of where Pirates of the Caribbean was filmed, some bat caves seen from outside, but gets the boat real close, Marigot Bay where the original Dr. Doolittle was filmed, the beautiful Pitons snorkelled in the water between the Pitons (sugar beach) which was amazing, plus a second snorkelling stop, which was not as good as the first and we would have preferred to have spent longer at the Pitons, but didn’t know this at the time. Had great fun at the sulphur springs/mud baths and the waterfall. Changing facilities available. Suggest taking old swimwear in case sulphur stains. We took chance of swimwear so not wet when going for lunch.
Peter was very knowledgable providing information & answering our questions.
Joseph from the boat came along to the waterfall & mud baths & took photos for us. He was very informative and funny.
Lunch was in a sea front restaurant, with nice views. Used by locals. Food was ok, good value for what we had.

Overall this was a fantastic full day trip, great value for a private trip (people at resort told us they paid $125 for TUI trip with many more people on bigger boat & not visiting as many places/ able to spend as long as we did at sights).

Would highly recommend Typhoon Tours. Peter is very professional with great local knowledge & Joseph is great fun.

If you’re staying at the Royalton check Peter out on the beach. You won’t miss him, he has a big straw hat & a Typhoon Tours T Shirt. You won’t regret it.

TIP - Be sure to check if there’s any cruise ships in. We did our trip on a day with no ships in port which meant no crowds making the experience so much better.

Thanks for a wonderful day Peter & Joseph. Made some great memories with good friends.
Definitely a day I will remember for a long time to come.

Best Wishes for continued success",Date of experience: November 2019,Typhoon Tours,3,St. Lucia
Best Fishing Trip Ever!,"Spending the day with Efi and Dimitrios (not forgetting Mohammed) is the best day you will have on your holiday. As you make your way out to sea, you will get a lovely breakfast of tea/coffee and homemade biscuits/cakes..
You'll not only learn how difficult being a fisherman is, but get to help bring in the catch for the day (if you want to), which is so much fun.
Dimitrios cleans the catch and Efi then cooks it for lunch ( there is always so much left over). As well as the freshest fish you will ever have you will have homemade wine/ouzo/lemonade, plus beer, water and soft drinks. All the salads, potatoes, herbs and fruits are organic, grown by Efi and Dimitrios. It goes without saying that Efi's cooking is to die for!
You will have swim stops at the most beautiful beaches/coves, accessable only by boat.
This is no ordinary day out as Efi and Dimitrios are great company and truly kind, funny and very informative. We didn't stop laughing all day.
Great value for a full day out.
Thanks Efi and Dimitrios for yet another wonderful day with superb food, drink, but most of all lovely company / friends.
Can't wait until next year!
Best wishes to you for a good season",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,3,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Major Building Works,"Currently staying at Catalonia Royal Bavaro, arrived 13/10/17 - 27/10/17.
Hotel is very nice, but there is major building works to one of the blocks, using heavy digging and drilling equipment from 8.00am - 6.00pm daily, resulting in serious noise nuisance during this time close to the main swimming pool.
Hotel management were not particularly helpful when reported only offering to change rooms, which unless we remained in the room all day would not make any difference.
If you want a nice beach and crystal clear water, suggest you look at others as there is a substantial amount of seaweed. Staff do there best to clear it, but it is relentless and personally I do not like swimming in seaweed.
Big Thank you to Alba in bar close to main pool and Lionel in Thalassa restaurant who have been great.",Date of stay: October 2017,Catalonia Royal Bavaro,3,Dominican Republic
50th Birthday Holiday,"Returned on 06/09/14 from a two week holiday of a lifetime to wonderful Kenya.
We spent 3 nights at Kilima 31/08/14-03/09/14.
On arrival at the Kitchwa Tembo airstrip we were met by the best guide in Kenya, the wonderful Martin.
He drove us a short way, stopped at the river Mara to show us a mighty croc & provided us with a much needed Tusker!
Then off to Kilima Camp, high on the escarpment.
The pictures do not do this place justice. It is so beautiful, with only birdsong & the distance sounds of the hippos in the river Mara as background noise, absolute heaven!
We were greeted by Clare and then met Paul who could not have been more attentive.
In fact every single member of staff was brilliant. Apologies I can't remember all their names, but a really massive thank you to all for making my trip everything I'd dreamed of and more.
The tents were spacious, & the hot water bottle a warm welcome as the nights were cold & wet!
The whole of the camp is beautifully designed, with lookouts over the Mara.
The food was delicious, very inventive & tasty! What a great team of chefs you have at Kilima!
The camp is open so animals roam freely. A pregnant zebra was takenby lions early one morning, not far from one of the tents. Sad for the zebra but very exciting for those of us staying at Kilima.
This was my 4th trip to Kenya, never seen a leopard. This was my challenge to Martin, who did not disappoint. Our very first afternoon game drive, Martin found a leopard in a tree with its kill. I was so happy I kissed Martin!
I could go on & on & on about how superb Kilima camp, it's staff & especially Martin is but I suggest everyone should go there & experience it for themselves.
Don't forget to ask for Martin that way you will be sure to see every animal you could wish to see.
Thank you All at Kilima including the staff we don't see behind the scenes.
I hope to return some day but until then, I have some great photos & even better memories.
Please tell Martin Clark says Jambo!",Date of stay: September 2014,Kilima Camp,3,"Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya"
Birthday trip,"Satao Elerai was the first of four camps we stayed at during out two weeks safari from 25/08/14 - 06/09/14.
We were greeted by Ryan who gave a brief intro & off we went to explore.
This camp is heaven, really. My first view was the infinity pool with Kilimanjaro towering over the camp. Then I looked to the water hole & there was a herd of elephants.
At that very moment I felt total contentment, something I will remember forever. It actually made me cry!
Do try the infinity pool even though it's freezing, the view from the pool, birds sitting drinking on the edge whilst you watch them & the view of Kilimanjaro whilst you're floating in the water is out of this world!
The tents all have a view of Kili, even from the toilet!
The shower is wonderfully hot & spacious.
All the staff are welcoming & very friendly, eager to please & meet whatever request you put to them. The food was ample and very good.
Mornings & evenings could be cold so the hot water bottle waiting in the bed was lovely.
Our guide was John from Game Watchers Safaris, he was
wonderful. It's a bit of a bumpy ride into & out if the camp but it's worth it. John showed us Amboseli & it's glorious wildlife. Lions, cheetah with its four growing up cubs making a kill, elephants everywhere, hippos, buffalo the list goes on & on, you get the idea, the whole experience was out of this world.
At Satao, we did a walk with Nenagre (sorry if I've spelt it wrong), we were told his name meant Ostrich so we could call him this.
We walked for about 1 1/2 hrs, but very slowing, stopping often for Ostrich & the 2 Masai men that escorting us could show us the ways of the Masai. They were all so knowledgable, funny & informative, it was truly a great way to spend time getting to know about the plants & their uses, different animal poo! and so much more, definitely a must do, worth the 20 US dollars.
I thoroughly recommend Satao Elerai and if you're planning a trip to Kenya & Amboseli stay here, you won't regret it!
I hope I can return one day.
A big thank you to Ryan & all the staff who made the start of our trip so amazing.",Date of stay: September 2014,Satao Elerai,3,"Amboseli Eco-system, Kenya"
50th Birthday Holiday,"Our flight was on 04/09/14. On arrival at Little Governors Balloon site, we were welcomed by Sanjay our pilot, who had introduced himself the night before at dinner. Before take off we were given a safety talk & explanation as to what will happen ect. Sanjay was quite funny and very informative, had great knowledge of the Mara & it's wildlife.
Once in the air, flying over the tree tops, looking down on the animals below with no sound except the noise of the balloon being fired up ( not the correct terminology I know!) was so peaceful, absolutely wonderful.
Sanjay ensured that the balloon turned frequently so all twelve of us got to see all angles/views.
We had a very gentle landing (upright) as the winds were light.
Big shout out & massive thank you to ALL the ground crew who prepare the breakfast site & then cook the breakfast, fantastic pancakes cooked on old balloon burners. Probably the best breakfast I had during my two weeks stay in Kenya!
Even had a portaloo for the ladies, something we didn't have when I did this before.
My only small critique would be to suggest that Sanjay does not make fun of those who are afraid to fly, as you don't know the reasons why they're not flying. It's really unprofessional to make chicken noises to paying customers and is very upsetting to those it is aimed at.",,Governors’ Balloon Safaris,3,"Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya"
