Good start to our holiday!,"Came to Jimmys on our first night arrived late and Taverna was busy but they accommodated is well in a safe way whilst still keeping the usual Greek hospitality! Lots of choice on the menu I would say this Taverna is a traditional affair whilst serving serving some very nice pizzas as well! My husband and I both went for traditional Greek dishes and enjoyed them both, nice big portions which was good as we were hungry, all at a very reasonable price! A good start to our stay!!",Date of visit: August 2020,Taverna Pizza Jimmy's,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Lovely experience,"Thoroughly enjoyed our experience today, made to feel very welcome nice family atmosphere! 4 year old nephew loved the dinosaurs and the interaction, server was great with the kids and attentive, food was tasty too large portions and fresh ingredients. Would definitely recommend it as a family meal out.",Date of visit: February 2020,Jurassic Grill,1,"Kettering, United Kingdom"
Greek Escape,"Had a fabulous time at the Elena Village, Hotel is built on an amazing setting with Telemenos directly in front of you and the cliffs behind. We were lucky to get and upgrade for a night in one of the rooms with a private pool, we didn’t realise this was an option as wasn’t available with Jet2 but definitely worth it if you can book one of these. However the standard rooms are equally as good large plenty of space, lovely big balconies so you can admire the amazing views. Hotel is very clean and tidy, all the staff are very friendly and helped us with any queries we had. Breakfast was good standard and plentiful. Short walk into the main area of town lots of tavernas to choose from didn’t have one bad meal. Would highly recommend.",Date of stay: October 2019,Elena Village,1,"Kalymnos, Greece"
Traditional Greek Hospitality,"Great restaurant on a balcony over looking across to Telendos, lots of lovely traditional Greek dishes on the menu all really good value, my Beef Stifado was delicious and my husband really enjoyed his Lamb Kleftico, service was good and the place had a good atmosphere.",Date of visit: September 2019,Matheos,1,"Kalymnos, Greece"
Good service,"This little place is always jam packed but we wanted to give it a try as it’s famed for its grilled food, service throughout was great and the value was good, our starter was really good and my husbands main was delicious just little disappointed in my chicken souvlaki as it was so dry it was almost inedible but thankfully it came with some tszazki, maybe I was just unlucky.",Date of visit: September 2019,Panos Restaurant Kalymnos,1,"Kalymnos, Greece"

Great start,"Come here on our first night what a great way to spend our holiday although it was pretty quiet it still had a lovely traditional Greek taverna feel to it, the whole family are involved. What was quite nice was how we were told how the dad made the bread and the honey was there own too. We liked it here as everything was produced by them a farm to plate experience! Good service and good value definitely recommend.",Date of visit: September 2019,Tsopanakos Restaurant,1,"Kalymnos, Greece"
Traditional Greek tavern,"Of you want traditional definitely come here lovely setting looking across to Telendos, lots of traditional dishes to choose from and good traditional Greek hospitality!",Date of visit: September 2019,Kalymnos Greek Taverna,1,"Kalymnos, Greece"
Busy atmosphere,"This place was busy every night of our stay with a lively good atmosphere, people always waiting for a table which is always a good sign, we only had a 10 minute wait which we didn’t mind, tables did feel a bit close together but it wasn’t to much of a problem, not many traditional Greek dishes but different takes on Mediterranean food. Slightly higher priced than other places we ate but worth it as food was lovely and service was good.",Date of visit: September 2019,Aegean Tavern,1,"Kalymnos, Greece"
Favourite meal of the week,"Came here for our wedding anniversary as we had seen all the good reviews and it always looked busy, service was very good all the staff where really friendly and helpful, all our dishes were very tasty my husband had the fish platter for one which he said was his best meal of the holiday, I enjoyed my pasta dish too.

Fabulous meal,"This restaurant was next door to our hotel Elena Village, every night we walked past it was busy, so glad we decided to give it a try, lovely setting good service and delicious food although not all
of the dishes are the traditional Greek ones you see in and out all the other restaurants the menu does have a Greek/Italian influence in it. Would recommend.",Date of visit: September 2019,Thrimpi Restaurant Dodecanesian Cuisine,1,"Kalymnos, Greece"
Lovely stay,"Just came back from a weeks stay at Hotel Bristol, we thoroughly enjoyed our time here and we would recommend the hotel if you were looking to stay in the area or to be near Pisa. Enrico the owner of the hotel and his team work incredibly hard to make sure you have a good stay, we messaged Enrico before hand to see if he had any superior rooms left available as this wasn’t an option at the time of booking with Jet2, he came back quickly and found us a superior room with an outside area like we wanted. We had a friendly arrival taken to our nice big room which we were pleased with, lots of wardrobe space, nice big bathroom with good shower and a comfortable bed as well as a nice outside seating area we were in room 401. The room we were in is in a separate block to the side of the pool and was nice and quiet, breakfast was served each morning in the main part of the hotel and had a good selection, special mention to the coffees Enrico will make what you fancy and the lovely pastry’s! The pool area is nice and tranquil plenty of sun loungers, pool towels are provided which is another nice touch, they have a honesty bar with a fridge you just write down what you take and room number and settle the bill before you leave we thought this was a nice touch. Enrico also has bikes you can use free of charge and we enjoyed our morning ride to Pisa Marina, everyone is friendly at the hotel and there to help,we had restaurant recommendations, bought bus tickets from reception as well on advice where to go out on the bikes all of this adding to the service and making our stay even more enjoyable",Date of stay: July 2019,Hotel Bristol,1,"Tirrenia, Italy"
Fantastic,"We had seen this restaurant near to some others we had eaten at so decided to give it a go, so glad we did my favourite meal by far, service was good and so was the value of the meal wild boar Ragu was amazing!! We would come back here again!",Date of visit: June 2019,Ristorante Pizzeria Chichibio,1,"Tirrenia, Italy"
Good busy local feel,"Really enjoyed our meal here larger restraint a short walk away from the main square in Tirrenia, very busy with locals and tourists they managed to find us a table quickly, seafood is the speciality here but you can get other options as well. We shared a large bowl of mussels to start which where very tasty, and both enjoyed our mains definitely worth a visit if you like your seafood!!",Date of visit: June 2019,Ristorante Cavaliere Nero,1,"Tirrenia, Italy"
Lovely meal,"We were recommended this restaurant by the hotel and had heard some other guests mention it was good, we were seated on a nice table outside. Staff were friendly and the service was good, lots of nice choices on the menu and well
priced, my husband commented that the steak dish he has was one of the nicest steaks he had had in a while. Definitely recommend!",Date of visit: June 2019,Piropo Ristorante Pizzeria,1,"Tirrenia, Italy"
Amazing food but...,"Came here on our first night after the good reviews on TA, it was a Saturday granted and we hadn’t booked as we had only arrived hours earlier but we thought we would try, they managed to squeeze us in kindly, it’s not the biggest of places and we were grateful that the found a table for us, unfortunately then due to it being a Saturday I guess and us being on a table tucked out the way it did feel like we got forgotten about we waited half an hour for the menu and our drinks order to be taken another 15 mins on top for our drinks to come then our starter only arrived an hour after we sat down followed by main course half an hour after that, now we don’t mind a leisurely meal and we could see it was a bit busy but we did feel it was a long time to wait, that said the food was amazing hence the 4 star rating, my suggestion would be definitely go but maybe not on a prime evening like a Friday or Saturday!",Date of visit: June 2019,Farmacia Dei Sani,1,"Tirrenia, Italy"
Date night,"Enjoyed our experience here service was very good pleasant waiter, nice seating area at the bar we got there a little early so decided to have a drink first, all done up nicely throughout, was busy but had a nice feel and we never once felt rushed. Food was good we opted for steaks, cooked as we asked and we felt good value for money. We would come back again.",Date of visit: June 2019,Miller & Carter,1,"Kettering, United Kingdom"
Delicious,"We love our Thai food and came here on recommendation and so glad we did, large restaurant which has a Thai feel with Thai music in the background like we experienced in Thailand. Service was good everyone was very polite and attentive. We had starters both were delicious the satay in particular, we then both had curry’s my husband had the wild curry and I had the special duck curry both were so tasty we really enjoyed our meals! Will recommend and come back.",Date of visit: April 2019,Royal Thai Restaurant,1,"Northampton, United Kingdom"

Relaxed Apres,"This bar was just down the road from our hotel we came here during the week on our stay and loved the atmosphere nice traditional bar, friendly staff and good drinks with the added bonus of some nibbles laid out every evening for you to nibble on for free. We really loved the atmosphere and it was our favourite place to visit after a long days skiing!",Date of visit: February 2019,El Bait,1,"Passo del Tonale, Italy"
Pit stop,Great cafe at the bottom of some of the main lifts good service relaxed feel tasty and good value food.,Date of visit: February 2019,Snow Break 360°,1,"Passo del Tonale, Italy"
Weeks skiing,"Just returned from a lovely stay at the Delle Alpi, the hotel is well located access to a lift to some lovely runs is only across the road and easy access to the bus stop for the shuttle bus that stops off all round the resort, our room was fab we had room 328 we paid the extra for the deluxe room and glad we did, it was a lovely corner room with plenty of space for storage a must when your skiing and have loads of gear, room was nicely decorated with an alpine theme, lovely big bathroom with great shower! However the view was the winner I will add some photos it was great to just sit in bed looking across the mountains! Our favourite thing however was the food every evening you got a choice from a menu of 3 starters and mains as well as a pudding and a full on buffet spread of salads veg etc that you could tuck into throughout the meal. The food was typically Italian some more basic meals and then some more fancier dishes each and every dish we had was tasty and the service from all
In the restaurant was to a high standard, breakfast in the same room was good although did get a bit of the same thing every morning, would be good if they could add some porridge maybe? But that may just be us Brits that like that to get us ready for a days skiing. We used the spa one afternoon this was pleasant however we went down during family time and didn’t realise that children where allowed in the spa so if your after a chilled out time in the spa make sure you go down after 17:30. The bar area is by the main reception we didn’t really use it much as we found that area to be very cold and to be honest after the large meal and long day skiing we where ready for bed. Ski room had plenty of space for everyone’s kits and good boot racks that seemed to get the boots dry ready for the next day. We thoroughly enjoyed our time in the resort and the hotel and we would recommend and would come back.",Date of stay: February 2019,Hotel Delle Alpi,1,"Passo del Tonale, Italy"
Recommendation,"Came to Niwan after a recommendation from a friend and so glad we did, lovely restaurant nicely done inside nothing to flashy but comfortable with a Turkish theme, service was great throughout the meal and we where made to feel very welcome, now to the food which was simply delicious, we shared some hummus and bread as a starter (portions are large here) my husband had a mixed grill he enjoyed every part of it but said the lamb chop he had was the best in a longtime, I had a lamb shashlik dish with mozzarella which was really tasty wish I could have eaten it all but I was stuffed! We agreed that next time we would go straight to mains, the whole meal was really good value! So nice to find some where local that’s nice to enjoy a lovely meal at, we will be back!",Date of visit: January 2019,Niwan Turkish Restaurant,1,"Wellingborough, United Kingdom"
Authentic,"Have been meaning to come here for a very long time and when we had the opportunity to travel to London and book a table for two people (which they now do) we jumped at the chance. Having travelled to Thailand and loving Thai food we were really looking forward to it and we weren’t disappointed, we went for the 2 person taster menu which was £35 pp, every dish was tasty! Service at the table was very good but we did have to wait half an hour for our booked table hence not given 5 stars.",Date of visit: November 2018,Som Saa,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Smart throughout,"Couple of nights stay here and first impressions count, lovely decorated throughout from reception, bar, restaurant and rooms. Staff on reception where friendly and helpful. Room fine for two for a couple of nights we just had a standard room would upgrade if you where wanting to stay longer. Breakfast was delicious however service was slow not from the kitchen more from the waitress/waiter wasn’t overly busy but no sense of urgency and we waited ages for the coffee to be topped up and a long time for our order to be taken both days hence not given a 5 star, I would stay here again and would recommend, area isn’t great but don’t let that put you off we felt safe and fine station is close by to access every where.",Date of stay: November 2018,New Road Hotel,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Bike hire,"Hired a couple of bikes for a day to cycle the Palma to El Arenal route, bikes were great and we enjoyed our day on them, didn’t find the staff very helpful sent us off with the bikes with out showing us how to adjust seat height etc, and also didn’t offer any ideas of routes etc when we asked thank goodness for google maps. Still given a good rate as the bikes were of good quality.",Date of experience: September 2018,Nano Bicycles,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Great base,"Just returned and had a lovely stay, Hotel is located with easy access to the city and old town, modern design and had a nice fresh feel to it. Room was nice and comfortable, roof top bar and pool area was lovely managed to get a sun lounger on the days we needed it. Roof top bar was a nice area too found it a bit odd that they served all drinks in plastic glasses didn’t really fit in with the rest of the feel of the hotel. Breakfast was a nice selection each morning, staff all friendly, would recommend as a perfect base for exploring the city.",Date of stay: September 2018,Innside by Melia Palma Center,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Authentic experiance,"Popped here on the off chance when walking by and seeing the meat being cooked by the chef through the window on a grill, place was really busy but they kindly managed to find us a seat, it was full of locals, there is no menus it’s a steak, bbq restaurant and the owner tells you what available he doesn’t speak much English but it was fun trying to get by with our limited Spanish but he son who is the chef speaks great English and did come out to explain as well. We were made to feel very welcome and loved the traditional Spanish atmosphere something we felt that was lacking in other restaurants in Palma. The food was delicious meat cooked to perfection and was great value, highly recommend was our best meal and evening of the week.",Date of visit: September 2018,La Cuadra Del Mano,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Laid back feel,"After a busy full on day we wanted some where to relax and enjoy our meal, this restaurant wasn’t far from our hotel so we decided to give it a go, on a nice pedestrian square are with lots of other bars, lots of locals more than tourist which we quite like, nice modern setting inside good menu choice, waitress was lovely and friendly we enjoyed our meal that much we will come back for lunch.",Date of visit: September 2018,La Reserva,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Great vibe,"Great tapas bar with a traditional feel but also very modern setting, nice buzzy atmosphere lots of great dishes to choose from some more traditional than others, the patas bravas was particularly good, service was good considering how busy it was! Well come back before we go for a lunch stop.",Date of visit: September 2018,Quina Creu,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Tapas with a twist,"Spent our first night here after reading great reviews on TA, nice setting in a small square only a small restaurant but has a lovely feel to it we sat outside on the square, waiter was friendly and made a recommendation as to how many dishes to have which was spot on, special mention to the Caribbean chicken! Give this place a try if you like the experience of tapas but fancy trying new inventive dishes, sangria was great here as well.",Date of visit: September 2018,Bazaar Tapas Bar & Restaurant,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Cosy,"Came here after recommendation from so other guests at our hotel and it was definitely worth their recommendation, nice setting cosy feel with relaxed atmosphere, good drinks selection and not badly priced, we both just had mains as we had a rather larger lunch earlier in the day my husband had the beef ribs and I had the spare ribs both were really tasty potatoes were divine. Would definitely recommend and we will be trying one of there other restaurants while we are here.",Date of visit: September 2018,Chez Camille,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Small and friendly,"Just returned from a lovely stay at what is now known as the Arda Varni Hotel, firstly what makes this place is the staff Monica, Anna and Stellios are all great and really make your stay that much more special. We where in the old block which we where more than happy with rooms are large great balcony view over the sea one side and mountain the other. Air con was fab and plenty of space to put things away. Bathrooms are the traditional Greek style which we had no problem with. Only thing I’d say on this side is you can hear the bar area of an evening but in general it didnt cause us to many issues. Breakfast was of a good basic Greek standard again what we are used to when staying in Greece. Pool area is tidy what has stopped me given this 5 stars are the lack of sun loungers not enough for everyone and also the condition many are broken and uncomfortable to lay on. Hotel is located part way up the hill we had no issues walking up and down but if you do struggle to get about this resort may not be for you. Lastly I think the tour company’s should make sure people are aware of the difference between the old and new block many people arriving asked to swap to the new block even though the old block was fine but there is a definite difference New block is 4 star old block more a 3 star. Maybe if people where more aware it would stop all the issues people have when they arrive wanting to swap rooms?",Date of stay: July 2018,Vrisida,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fabulous tour and way to see Kefalonia,"We spent a lovely half a day doing the medium tour from booking the trip to doing it it all went smoothly, the trip itself starts with a drive up to Mount Aenos from which you start you descent through the National Park, our guides where great really friendly and knowledgeable about the bikes as well as kefalonia, we stopped off 3 times to see an old church, hospital as well as a village that was effected by the earthquake in the 50s, we asked loads of questions and all where answered we really enjoyed the area we rode in it was nice to see the local life and scenery. I would highly recommend this trip as a different way to see the island. We would definitely do it again.",Date of experience: July 2018,Fiora Bikes,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Brilliant day made by Efi and Dimitrios,"Had a lovely day yesterday with Efi and Dimitrios we where due to do the trip early in the week but due to the bad weather Efi rearranged it for us, from start to finish this trip was fun and full of information about Kefalonia and the fish we caught and Efi cooked. There was 8 of us on the trip which was really nice as so many boat trips are crammed! But on this trip we all got time to get to know one another. We managed to catch lots of fish and cuttlefish Efi and Dimitrios explained what we where catching which was really interesting, we stopped in two beautiful places for a lovely swim and the lunch they provided was amazing. But most of all the day was made by Efi and Dimitrios hospitality they are really good hosts and made sure we where all catered for and that we enjoyed our trip. Highly recommend and a must do if coming to Kefalonia.",Date of experience: July 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Traditional,"After hearing lots of good reviews from other guests at our hotel we booked to go here this evening, Liza is very friendly and welcoming, menu is limited to specials every day but there was still enough choice to choose from. The restaurant is very small and Liza and staff whizz run at a hundred miles an hour to please everyone if that’s is my one criticism that would be it, but size of the restaurant cannot be helped and they are only trying to please. Both our meals and starter where good my husband was particularly pleased with his goat dish. This little place is worth a visit just make sure you book.",Date of visit: June 2018,Liza's Grill,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Delicious,"Made the walk to this restaurant and it was most definitely worth it, staff really friendly and service was good lots of items on the menu so plenty of choice, portions are large we did share a starter before hand but we probably didn’t need to. We each had a pork and chicken souvlaki both were very tasty portions where just so big with chips and pita bread we just couldn’t eat it all. Would recommend going maybe worth booking as we where lucky to get a table as it got very busy as the evening went on.",Date of visit: June 2018,Souvlaki Steak House & Grill,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely setting,"Came here on the wettest night we had ever experienced with flash flooding that said it didn’t spoil our lovely meal, restaurant was reduced by half as the front are was wet and flooded by staff still did there best to accommodate everyone looking for a table, staff all friendly service was good. Lots of nice meal choices I had souvlaki swordfish which was lovely and I would have again. Would highly recommend you book here as we where just very lucky to get in and plenty of people at our hotel had tried but couldn’t get a table. A must visit if in Lourdata.",Date of visit: June 2018,Klimatis Tavern,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Family run,"Popped here for dinner as the evening turned out to be very wet and this was only a short stroll from our hotel, very traditional taverna family run two sisters and the rest of the family helping, nice big restaurant so we managed to get a table easy. Service was good and we decided to go for traditional Greek choices our starter and mains were both lovely my husband even said his lamb was the best he had had so far. Not sure why this place has had a run of bad reviews as we found it to be very pleasant and food good and on talking to other guests at our hotel many had said they had been there and enjoyed the food.",Date of visit: June 2018,Dionysos Taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
First night,"After arriving later in the evening on our first night we where pleased to see that this little taverna next door to our hotel was still serving food, nice setting outside on a patio area with tree coverage, staff all really friendly and service was good. Lots of traditional Greek dishes plus a few more everyday bits as well but when in Greece we want to eat Greek food, we have the Fava to share which was lovely and a decent sized portion for sharing my husband then had the moussaka and I had the stuffed vegetables both where really tasty and we bothered enjoyed our meal all for really good value. A nice little taverna definitely worth a stop.",Date of visit: June 2018,Trifilli Taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Beautiful views,"Went to Lorraine’s last night and so glad we did what a lovely setting and views it’s worth the trip there for that alone, we dropped in on off chance and had to wait in the bar area for a table which was bout 30 mins, bar area is worth just visiting for a drink as the views across to Zante are lovely. Staff are all very friendly and service was good we did wait a little while between starter and mains but we could see the restaurant was very busy. We shared a starter as we had heard portions are big and the starter was more than enough for two. We both enjoyed our main as well both were really tasty. This restaurant is definitely worth a visit for both food and the views.",Date of visit: June 2018,Lorraine's Magic Hill,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
What a delight,"Had a lovely meal at La Estella last night hubby and I are massive tapas fans and have eaten in some very good tapas in Barcelona and Madrid and must say this is on par on what we had there. Nice setting small but comfortable and nicely laid out, feels authentic with Spanish music in the back round and we very easily forgot that we weren’t in Spain. Service was really good we were looked after by a lovely young girl from Barcelona who made sure we where ok throughout the night. Nice selection of dishes and everything we had was lovely particularly mention to the Black Pudding dish and Goats cheese dish. All for a very good price as well we will most definitely be back and highly recommend.",Date of visit: June 2018,La Estrella,1,"Rushden, United Kingdom"
Wonderful food,"Popped here in the summer and sat in the garden and thought we must come back for a meal, lasts night we came back for that meal and what a lovely tasty treat it was, lovely setting inside comfortable and relaxed but all decorated to a nice standard, wasn’t overall busy but guess it’s mid jan, service was a little slow for considering how quiet it was, wasn’t a huge issue as we weren’t in a rush but we did have to ask if we could order after waiting over 15 minutes and two other tables getting served before us even though they came in after us, that said the food was very good and made up for that. Starters where a good size and very tasty we went for the veggie tart and the crispy pork, mains I had the chicken and hubby had the venison, both where lovely and looked great. We would definitely come back as the food was so good.",Date of visit: January 2018,The Four Pears,1,"Northampton, United Kingdom"
Humble Portuguese food,"After much research on TA we decided to come here on our first night and we where glad we did, we arrived before 8 and managed to get the last free table, the two waitresses where really pleasant throughout making sure we where happy with our meals, we each chose the set menu which consisted of starter main and pudding for €19 which was really good value, starter was a selection of cheese ham olives, mains my husband had the veal skewer which was cooked as requested medium rare and I had the mix seafood with the largest prawns I have ever seen! We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals! To finish off for pudding you are offered a couple of desserts or a glass of port I choose a dessert and my husband decided on the port again we both enjoyed what we went for. Towards the end of our meal people where queuing to get in both locals and tourists. So glad we are here and we would both recommend.",Date of visit: October 2017,Leitaria Camponeza,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Best meal in Lisbon,"Took a chance in getting a table in this cosy tapas bar, it was full when we arrived but we where told if we where happy to wait we would get a table which we did. Two guys that are front of house and I think in the business where very friendly and helpful talking through the menu and having a laugh and joke with us. All dishes are reasonably priced for tapas and portions where good. We really enjoyed all the dishes we chose but the pigs cheeks where our favourite. The hospitality is great here and you really are made to feel welcome and food is just great, if we where staying longer we would definitely go back.",Date of visit: October 2017,da Prata 52 - Petiscos ¦ Tapas,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Almost a great olace,"Firstly the setting inside this restaurant is lovely with a traditional opulent feel. We booked a table and we where quickly seated. The restaurant is particularly big and there seem to be a lot of waiters on hand but we found the service to be a little slow, my husband had some questions he wanted to ask about certain cuts we where told by the polite waiter that he would need to get the head waiter to help us 15 minutes later no one came and our Waiter came back to us completely forgetting that we had some questions so in the end we order what we knew which was a shame as we wanted to try something different, drinks orders took some time to come to and they forgot our table water we had to ask for this twice. Meal wise my husband steak was cooked medium rare as requested I asked for medium rare too but my steak came on the good side of medium, that said all the side dishes where lovely. We where offered before the mains came out some bread and dips these where lovely too but we where only given about 2 mins to eat them before our mains came out. Paying the bill proved difficult too took is 30 mins to finally get the bill and to pay, we were not in a rush but just found it frustrating as we seemed to have been forgotten. All in all lovely setting meal parts of where delicious just service could be better.",Date of visit: October 2017,RIB Beef & Wine,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Perfect base,"Great long weekend away using this hotel as our base, great location easy to get to when we arrived we used the Aerobus and got off at stop 12 hotel is less than 5 minute walk from there, also metro stop nearby so you could use that to get to hotel. We where in room 302 which was a decent size plenty of wardrobe space and nice bathroom with a good shower. Our room looked out onto the road which was busy but that said the rooms seem well sound proofed as we heard very little noise. Breakfast is served next too reception, help your self style continental with some hot options, plenty on offer each morning, staff also made us a pack up breakfast on the morning we left as our flight was early I thought this was a nice touch. They also booked us a transfer back to the airport which was only €17 euros which was good value and driver was a nice guy who they always apparently use. All in all great place nice friendly staff and in a great spot for exploring Lisbon.",Date of stay: May 2017,The 7 Hotel,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Relaxing short break,"Just returned from a 5 day stay at the Maria Nova hotel! We had a really good relaxing stay and feel like our batteries are recharged! From the moment we arrived we where made to feel very welcome with a welcome drink, staff on the reception gave us some information about Tavira as in best way to walk into town and what was going on locally. First impression the hotel has been done out lovely really high standard with a modern feel. Rooms are a good size plenty of storage space comfy beds and nice balcony looking over the pool, bathroom is finished nicely but as mentioned the shower does leak but we managed to find a way of stopping it with towels so this didn't overly concern us. We where just on a B&B basis so only used the restaurant for breakfast which offers plenty of choice as well as offering a few different hot items day to day. We did use the roof top bar in the evenings personally we loved it with the view overlooking Tavira, that we went their every night. We didn't find the drinks to be much more expensive than in town. We did use the spa one day, we aren't normally spa people but gave it a whirl, it again was all done out nicely and I'm sure if you like that sort of thing guests would find it enjoyable. The reason I haven't given this hotel 5/5 is because of a couple of things firstly the pool area is slightly lacking in comparison to the rest of the hotel inside which is very clean and tidy, pool area feels a bit dated tired and sadly the pool was not the cleanest, both pools where a bit grubby and we didn't see them get cleaned at all this did put us off venturing in, the sun loungers many of which where broken and look like they have seen better days again not in keeping with the rest of the hotel, also there are lots of weeds growing through the paving slabs we saw the gardeners once in our stay and they did cut the grass but seem to over look all the weeds in the paving? Lastly the pool bar the service is great and I'm sure will be even better when the swim up side opens but we thought it a bit odd that no pool snacks/lunches where offered I'm sure the hotel are missing a treat with this as most people ventured into town or bought goodies back from the bakery. It seems a shame as I would love to give this hotel 5/5 for their lovely staff but unfortunately pool area let's the side down. That said we did have a nice stay and we would return we would just hope next time the pool area may be improved.",Date of stay: August 2017,Maria Nova Lounge Hotel,1,"Tavira, Portugal"
Nice setting and great food,"Came across this restaurant one lunch time and thought must give this a go in the evening, popped in last night without booking hoping to get a table we where in luck everyone was sitting inside as it had been raining that evening, we where lucky as they managed to find us a table. Inside has been nicely done out and had upmarket feel to it, all the staff where very smartly presented and service throughout from them was great. Considering the upmarket feel the food was very good value we shared some croquets which where really good, my husband had the Portuguese steak which he enjoyed and I opted for the tuna steak. Portions where large and tasted great, wine and drink selection where plentiful and again good price points, we really enjoyed our meal here and glad we stumbled across it.",Date of visit: August 2017,Alvaro de Campos Restaurante,1,"Tavira, Portugal"
Lunch stop,"So good we came back, on our first day we found this place near to our hotel what a great start to our stay having lunch here. It was so good that we said we must come back and we have just done so and it was great again!",Date of visit: August 2017,No de Gosto,1,"Tavira, Portugal"
Worth the wait,"Are here on our last evening definitely worth the wait in trying to get booked in. Nice setting outside sat on the pavement on a lovely square, staff all friendly and service was good. Lots of choice of tapas and all reasonably priced, we particularly enjoyed the pigs cheeks and the octopus salad! So glad we managed to get a table make sure you book to avoid disappointment!",Date of visit: August 2017,Pausa,1,"Tavira, Portugal"
Great find,"My husband and I had initially tried to get in somewhere else for dinner we hadn't booked so couldn't get in where we had initially intended to go, however that actually worked out great as we came across Mira, I recognised it from some of the TA reviews I had read so we decided to give it a go and we are very glad we did. Staff where really friendly two young guys really looked after us and liked a laugh and a joke. The tapas was great in particular the roast beef, octopus and the stuffed bread! We sat outside as it was a nice evening but inside looked just as inviting. Really enjoyed our meal here and we would recommend.",Date of visit: August 2017,Mira Cafe Tapas&wine,1,"Tavira, Portugal"
Great spot,"What a great little place nicely set on the river front in between the two bridges, perfect spot to people watch. This place is only small so I would advise going early or book to avoid disappointment. Staff are nice and friendly went out of their way to explain some of the dishes on the menu. We went for tapas selection ordering 4 dishes initial all of which where delicious! We where looked after really well and throughly enjoyed our evening and food so much so we decided to be greedy and order a 5th dish! Highly recommend!",Date of visit: August 2017,Pessoa's Cafe Wine & Tapas,1,"Tavira, Portugal"
Good start,"Stopped here on our first evening in Tavira based on TA reviews, there is a small area of seats allocated outside luckily managed to get a seat with no problem we had arrived before 8. It began to rain though so every one moved inside, we weren't disappointed as inside is just as lovely and authentic with its beautiful tiled walls. It's a very small team that run the restaurant we assumed a husband and wife team, so don't come here if you need to rush off somewhere the whole experience is nice and relaxed which we where fine with as we where in no rush. We shared a starter which was prawns these where so good we both wished we had had a plate each. Mains my husband had the lamb which fell
Off the bone and I had the fish pot which was full of dish and seafood you would have paid a fortune back at home for! All in all a nice meal and nice place and a good start to our trip.",Date of visit: August 2017,Nikita Restaurante Bar Cafe,1,"Tavira, Portugal"
Relaxed,"Just returned from this lovely hotel, the hotel is set just outside the main Ciutadella centre looking across to a little beach and cove area. It's nice bright and airy and we where welcomed straight away with a drink of the local Gin and lemonade. Before I go into any other detail what really makes this place is the staff they are all so pleasant and do there jobs with a smile, always on hand to offer advice and made the hotel a really pleasant place to stay. We booked a sea view room which we really felt was worth it picture attached. The rooms are nice and large we had room 242 plenty of space to hang all our clothes and room is so big you can store your cases out the way with out them being a nuisance. The room has a safe and a fridge which had some complimentary water on our arrival. Bath room was large with his and hers sinks and a nice jacuzzi bath, and finally the bed was more than comfortable and of a good size. It was very hot whilst we where there we found the aircon easy to easy and seemed quite modern and was not noisy at all. We stayed on a B&B basis breakfast is served on the lower floor in a nice big room breakfast is buffet style we where astonished by the amount of choice there really is something to please every one, breakfast was served form 7:30 till 10. 9 o'clock seemed to be the busiest time. The pool area is in the middle of the hotel the pool is a nice size and has easy access with a ramp and stairs, the only reason I haven't awarded the hotel a 5 is some of the decking around the pool looked a bit past it and really needed replacing making it a bit unsteady underfoot in places also I think in the height of the season it could be tricky to get a sun lounger round the pool it was getting difficult towards the end of the stay, there are however two sun terraces above the pool which has loungers we didn't use these as it's not direct access to the pool. The hotel has a spa we had a treatment whilst we where there and found this to be good value and very relaxing I am very surprised more people don't use this area as it was very quiet and very pleasant The hotel also has a snack pool type bar we had lunch there on two occasions and really enjoyed what we had we also came back some evenings to drink in the bar, our only criticism would be this area needs to have more then one person working on it who ever was behind the bar was always struggling to keep up when it was busy we really felt for them as they where really trying there best but that bar really needs two people working on it. The hotels is only a 15 min walk to the main square if you take the short cut so easily accessible also the bus stop for Mahon is only a 15 min walk away as well so this hotel is really way placed. We would most definitely come back to Ciutadella and we would most definitely stay here again.",Date of stay: June 2017,Port Ciutadella,1,"Menorca, Spain"
Best Tapas,"Wow what a place! We are towards the end of our holiday and kept walking pass this little gem determined to get in here we went before 9 and managed to get a table. The place is beautiful apparently it was an old palace that up until two years ago was an art gallery, very romantic setting with lighting etc. Menu comes on a little board with a tick sheet for you to mark what you would like which is a nice novel idea. All choices sounded delicious! Waiter helped us identify what some of the items where and went into good detail clearly understanding what each dish was. He recommended 4 dishes max as portions are quite large. All over our choices were amazing in particular the leek and mushroom dish which was a bit of a wild card but to our surprise it edged ahead as our favourite. Wine menu had a good selection and plenty of other drinks to choice from Gins, beers etc. We have this as our favourite place now! Make sure if you go to wander to the garden which you are allowed to do it's beautiful.",Date of visit: July 2017,Moriarty,1,"Menorca, Spain"
Good lunch stop,Found this restaurant as we where staying in the port Ciutadella hotel just down the road this is only about 5 mins walk away from there along the costal walk into town. Lovely setting looking out across the coastline watching the larger ferries come in from the other Balearic Islands. Food is good nice selection and no different to prices else where in Ciutadella. If you are staying nearby I would definitely say this is a good place to wander to for a bit of lunch.,Date of visit: July 2017,Restaurante Sa Prensa,1,"Menorca, Spain"
Paella,"Popped her on our last night for dinner we fancied paella in the last night and we had walked past in the evenings and seen some whilst people where eating that looked good.

Evening meal,"Tried Ses Voltes as the idea of eating on a roof terrace over looking the old town appealed to us, unfortunately couldn't get a seat on the terrace as it was all fully booked our own fault for not booking. We where happy to sit in the restaurant which has been done up nicely with a modern touch, lots of choices on the menu with a few favourites that have had a modern twist out on them. We both really enjoyed the food and service was good.",Date of visit: July 2017,Ses Voltes,1,"Menorca, Spain"
Loved by the lovals,"We had tried to get a table here for a couple of nights this little place is popular with locals finally managed to get a table, food here is rustic and traditional, setting is lovely on the lovely cobbled streets of the old town sat outside. Staff where attentive and service was good. Portions here are large but we shared a starter we both enjoyed our meals but both found the food bit over seasoned with salt a lot of salt, we like salt our selves and always season but on this case it was just slightly over. That however wouldn't stop me encouraging people to give this place a try.",Date of visit: July 2017,La Guitarra,1,"Menorca, Spain"
Fabulous,"My husband and I fancied a change from seafood and tapas and the write ups on TA suggested this would be the place for a change. Easy to find on the top of the high street building is an old granary with a traditional windmill truly breathtaking placing, you can sit outside but inside is so lovely we choose to sit inside. Good menu with plenty of choice also a good wine menu with house wines starting from €11, we had mussels to share as a starter you also get given some bread olives and aioli. We had lamb cutlets and sirloin steak for mains, my lamb was cooked lovely and was really tasty my husbands steak was cooked exactly as he asked was well seasoned and rested to perfection it was like butter!! Best meal we have had so far!! The staff where all very attentive and service was to a high standard!

A couple of gentlemen came and sat next to us they spoke more Spanish than us and asked for salad and mussels again I do speak little Spanish but understood what they had asked for the same waiter that we had said yes to them and they managed to get the lunch we had hoped for whilst we sat and ate sandwiches we hadn't anticipated on having, really disappointed as we tried to be friendly and speak as much Spanish as we could and felt we where treated unfairly I would not come here again or recommend.",Date of visit: June 2017,Frankfurt,1,"Menorca, Spain"
Great Concept,"My husband and I where really excited when we heard about Foodie Rocks the concept of street food served in a Tapas fashion sounded perfect to us as we lovely trying as many different things when we eat out and go travelling, the setting was great it's been nicely done with the rustic look that is very in at the moment. Ordering was easy your handing a menus and a tick sheet which you just fill in and take to the bar to place an order the recommend 2-3 dished per person but we are so greedy and everything sounded great that we ended ordering 7 dishes, everything we ordered was delicious the Korean chicken was both of our favourite though, the food comes out very quickly so in hind sight we would next time order a couple of dishes at a time rather than all together other wise the food goes a bit cold, portions are a good size for sharing. All very reasonable in price as well from drinks to food. Would highly recommend and it's great that Northampton has a little gem of a place like this.",Date of visit: April 2017,Streetfood by F.Rocks,1,"Northampton, United Kingdom"
Could be great!,"As a local in Higham and a massive foodie I was very excited to hear that the Carriage house was renovating and introducing a lovely restaurant, went with a group of friends who aren't local, we all loved the setting and all commented how nice it was done, team in restaurant where a young team sat us down quickly to our table and gave us our menu, however after that we seemed to have been forgotten about for nearly 20 mins, we didn't mind to much as we where all catching up but we did think it was a bit strange as the place wasn't busy, finally the waitress came took our meal order but never asked us for our drinks bearing in mind we had sat there for 20 mins with out, we had to ask her to take our drink order, then took another 10 mins till our drinks came so a bit slow! Once the meals came out we had starters and mains again took them ages to clear plates and with the starter plates they took 3 of the plates then left another just waiting there till the mains came out. The food,all the food was lovely however portions where measly to say the least, none of us are big buffet type eaters either we have all fine dined at times and the portions at the Carriage house made fine dining look like a huge plate of food. This would put me off coming again unfortunately.",Date of visit: April 2017,The Carriage House,1,"Higham Ferrers, United Kingdom"
Adequate but could with a bit of improvement be great.,"Just returned from the Hotel Ibiza, this hotel has so much to offer it just isn't quite there as yet, all the staff where very friendly this was the biggest plus point, when booking we didn't have an option to book the south facing rooms so we had to go for north, the room itself is Bijou if not a little cramped especially for a full week when your there with loads of ski gear, it was well decorated but just a little tired towards the end of the season, the beds where made everyday however emptying the tiny bin was only done when it was overfilling and the box of tissues that was empty on arrival was never replaced, the north rooms don't really allow for space to hang and dry ski gear this was something echoed by other guest in rooms that side. Bar area was very nicely done, restaurant area although next door didn't seem to carry on with the lovely theme in the bar and felt very tired, at least two of the chairs that I sat on where broken in the restaurant. The food itself was a good standard plenty of choice for breakfast and dinner, all was self service but waiter staff where on hand and all were very pleasant. The pool area was very tired and a bit of a health hazard there was structural issues by the pool with bits of wood balanced on chairs holding up a section of the roof! This area needs massive improvements as it doesn't feel safe down there. The ski/boot room is big enough but no way of getting heat to your boots to dry them out there is a heater in there but it is no where near the boot section this is another area that needs improving especially as it's a ski resort hotel. The best thing about this place was the shuttle service this ran down to the main lifts from 9-12 and picked you up from 4-6 the guy that picked us up every day was lovely he really deserves a mention as do the rest of the staff as they have really earnt the place the 3 stars as I would only have given it 2 based on all the rest. I wouldn't go back unless there where some changes.",Date of stay: March 2017,Hôtel Ibiza,1,"Les Deux-Alpes, France"
Make sure you book,"Had a meal last night and what a great little place this is, luckily I managed to get us a table booked as they where having to turn lots of people away. Great atmosphere buzzy yet informal, I loved the fact that the menus where only in French the waiter went through each dish and explained very well in English what each item was. Lots of choice from traditional Alpes cuisine to standard regulars like burgers etc. Portions are large here so we only had a main each both where great! The waiter made sure we where ok and happy with our meals and the service just made you feel very welcome. Can see why it is too place to eat in Les Deux Alpes.

Afternoon tea,"Just had afternoon tea at Fawsley, atmosphere where you have the afternoon tea was lovely really nice setting and feels very opulent. Various choices on the afternoon teas we went for the Festive Tea, sandwiches where ok no different to what you can make yourself. Scone was nice and probably the best part, the fancies where ok. I have had quite a few afternoon teas and this one was bar far the most expensive and the afternoon tea was quite lack lustre in comparison to the actually venue its self.",,Afternoon Tea at Fawsley Hall,1,"Fawsley, United Kingdom"
Lovely food,"Myself and my husband have been trying to get in here for some time and we are so glad we preserved in getting a table, it was a quiet night we went as towards end of January before payday, the restaurant has a lovely atmosphere great for a romantic meal or a meal with friends and family. Staff where really friendly and attentive to is. They had a new menu we had scallops to start as well as the ham hock special starter both were very good and the right amount for a starter, for mains I had the duck which was gorgeous and husband had the fillet steak which he said was one of the best he ever had. Quite liked the fact you could see the chefs working on the pass, they all seemed very happy which reflected in the food. Only reason I haven't given it 5 stars was the room was very cold, yes it is January but it was really cold in there and it just took the edge of the experience! That said we wouldn't hesitate to come back.",Date of visit: January 2017,Old House,1,"Northampton, United Kingdom"

Feast for eyes and taste sensation,"So glad we managed to get a table here for our mini break in Bath, and we where not disappointed totally loved the concept of no menu and being led down a culinary journey pushing your taste buds to try things I had never tried or heard of before. Setting is great nice cosy atmosphere, service was fab everything was explained in great detail from dish to dish and we where helped to pick a wine that would suite mine and my husbands taste. Loved the fact that it was an open kitchen and we could see the chefs at work. All courses where great but stand out for both me and the husband was the Sea Bass, we would definitely recommend and come back again as the menu changes daily dependant on what is in season.

Little piece of Spain,"What a great little place, firstly if you want to go you need to book and so glad we did. This little tapas bar only seats 20 ish people but has a great authentic atmosphere. All the staff are Spanish and are really enthusiastic. Lots of choice on the menu and details under each description where good and also gave details of where the dish is local to in Spain we thought this was a nice touch, out of the 8 dishes we ordered there was only 1 which we probably wouldn't go for again but that is more down to our taste than anything wrong with the dish its self. We love our tapas and been to many a tapas bar in Barcelona and Madrid and thought this was a great find in Bath.",Date of visit: December 2016,Ole Tapas,1,"Bath, United Kingdom"
Not Luxury but good basic base,"Recently returned back from the residenza Bourbon, these are sold through travel republic and there own website as luxury and although they are very clean and tidy both my husband and I both felt there where more a basic base rather than a luxury boutique place to stay. Being basic was fine for us as we did not spend a lot of time there that said there where a few things that could be improved, room was of good sized however needed a bit of tlc,first night our bed throw had a large bleach stain on it and all the walls round the room where badly scuffed marked wear and tear is part and parcel but it could be kept on top of. Furniture was also a bit battered. Bathroom was nicely finished that said on our 4 day stay we only had about 2 mins worth of luke warm water throughout the stay!! The ladies that own the hotel may have been just whilst we where there but we only saw them first day for 5 mins and last day as we checked out at this point to late to mention water issues. Breakfast is very basic if you like to load your self up ready for the day this breakfast won't offer you that but will tie you over if you like yoghurt fruit and some stale cakes. Location about 10 min walk to tremini station and 25 walk to Spanish steps. We wouldn't stay here again as I would prefer to stay some where that is manned all the time I found it a bit disconcerting that there was no one there all the time. However if you want a basic base in a nice location then this would suffice.",Date of stay: October 2016,Residenza Bourbon,1,"Rome, Italy"

Ordering was easy your handing a menus and a tick sheet which you just fill in and take to the bar to place an order the recommend 2-3 dished per person but we are so greedy and everything sounded great that we ended ordering 7 dishes, everything we ordered was delicious the Korean chicken was both of our favourite though, the food comes out very quickly so in hind sight we would next time order a couple of dishes at a time rather than all together other wise the food goes a bit cold, portions are a good size for sharing. All very reasonable in price as well from drinks to food. Would highly recommend and it's great that Northampton has a little gem of a place like this.",Date of visit: April 2017,Streetfood by F.Rocks,1,"Northampton, United Kingdom"
Could be great!,"As a local in Higham and a massive foodie I was very excited to hear that the Carriage house was renovating and introducing a lovely restaurant, went with a group of friends who aren't local, we all loved the setting and all commented how nice it was done, team in restaurant where a young team sat us down quickly to our table and gave us our menu, however after that we seemed to have been forgotten about for nearly 20 mins, we didn't mind to much as we where all catching up but we did think it was a bit strange as the place wasn't busy, finally the waitress came took our meal order but never asked us for our drinks bearing in mind we had sat there for 20 mins with out, we had to ask her to take our drink order, then took another 10 mins till our drinks came so a bit slow! Once the meals came out we had starters and mains again took them ages to clear plates and with the starter plates they took 3 of the plates then left another just waiting there till the mains came out. The food,all the food was lovely however portions where measly to say the least, none of us are big buffet type eaters either we have all fine dined at times and the portions at the Carriage house made fine dining look like a huge plate of food. This would put me off coming again unfortunately.",Date of visit: April 2017,The Carriage House,1,"Higham Ferrers, United Kingdom"
Adequate but could with a bit of improvement be great.,"Just returned from the Hotel Ibiza, this hotel has so much to offer it just isn't quite there as yet, all the staff where very friendly this was the biggest plus point, when booking we didn't have an option to book the south facing rooms so we had to go for north, the room itself is Bijou if not a little cramped especially for a full week when your there with loads of ski gear, it was well decorated but just a little tired towards the end of the season, the beds where made everyday however emptying the tiny bin was only done when it was overfilling and the box of tissues that was empty on arrival was never replaced, the north rooms don't really allow for space to hang and dry ski gear this was something echoed by other guest in rooms that side. Bar area was very nicely done, restaurant area although next door didn't seem to carry on with the lovely theme in the bar and felt very tired, at least two of the chairs that I sat on where broken in the restaurant. The food itself was a good standard plenty of choice for breakfast and dinner, all was self service but waiter staff where on hand and all were very pleasant. The pool area was very tired and a bit of a health hazard there was structural issues by the pool with bits of wood balanced on chairs holding up a section of the roof! This area needs massive improvements as it doesn't feel safe down there. The ski/boot room is big enough but no way of getting heat to your boots to dry them out there is a heater in there but it is no where near the boot section this is another area that needs improving especially as it's a ski resort hotel. The best thing about this place was the shuttle service this ran down to the main lifts from 9-12 and picked you up from 4-6 the guy that picked us up every day was lovely he really deserves a mention as do the rest of the staff as they have really earnt the place the 3 stars as I would only have given it 2 based on all the rest. I wouldn't go back unless there where some changes.",Date of stay: March 2017,Hôtel Ibiza,1,"Les Deux-Alpes, France"
Make sure you book,"Had a meal last night and what a great little place this is, luckily I managed to get us a table booked as they where having to turn lots of people away. Great atmosphere buzzy yet informal, I loved the fact that the menus where only in French the waiter went through each dish and explained very well in English what each item was. Lots of choice from traditional Alpes cuisine to standard regulars like burgers etc. Portions are large here so we only had a main each both where great! The waiter made sure we where ok and happy with our meals and the service just made you feel very welcome. Can see why it is too place to eat in Les Deux Alpes. Would highly recommend.",Date of visit: March 2017,Le Trappeur,1,"Les Deux-Alpes, France"
Afternoon tea,"Just had afternoon tea at Fawsley, atmosphere where you have the afternoon tea was lovely really nice setting and feels very opulent. Various choices on the afternoon teas we went for the Festive Tea, sandwiches where ok no different to what you can make yourself. Scone was nice and probably the best part, the fancies where ok. I have had quite a few afternoon teas and this one was bar far the most expensive and the afternoon tea was quite lack lustre in comparison to the actually venue its self.",,Afternoon Tea at Fawsley Hall,1,"Fawsley, United Kingdom"
Lovely food,"Myself and my husband have been trying to get in here for some time and we are so glad we preserved in getting a table, it was a quiet night we went as towards end of January before payday, the restaurant has a lovely atmosphere great for a romantic meal or a meal with friends and family. Staff where really friendly and attentive to is. They had a new menu we had scallops to start as well as the ham hock special starter both were very good and the right amount for a starter, for mains I had the duck which was gorgeous and husband had the fillet steak which he said was one of the best he ever had. Quite liked the fact you could see the chefs working on the pass, they all seemed very happy which reflected in the food. Only reason I haven't given it 5 stars was the room was very cold, yes it is January but it was really cold in there and it just took the edge of the experience! That said we wouldn't hesitate to come back.",Date of visit: January 2017,Old House,1,"Northampton, United Kingdom"
New Years day,"Just returned from a family meal for a member of the family as well as New Years Day, venue has a lovely old traditional Inn feel to it. We had a nice round table for our large party which was great as we could all hear one another, service was prompt and all staff where attentive, all the starters where great and everyone really enjoyed then main was mainly Sunday lunch options we all said the meat was lovely but thought there could have been more options on the veg and the roast potatoes weren't the best, puddings where good and there was plenty of choice. Coffees where also served. I would come here again but would probably try a day when we could order from an ala carte menu.",Date of visit: January 2017,The Butcher's Arms,1,"Priors Hardwick, United Kingdom"
Feast for eyes and taste sensation,"So glad we managed to get a table here for our mini break in Bath, and we where not disappointed totally loved the concept of no menu and being led down a culinary journey pushing your taste buds to try things I had never tried or heard of before. Setting is great nice cosy atmosphere, service was fab everything was explained in great detail from dish to dish and we where helped to pick a wine that would suite mine and my husbands taste. Loved the fact that it was an open kitchen and we could see the chefs at work. All courses where great but stand out for both me and the husband was the Sea Bass, we would definitely recommend and come back again as the menu changes daily dependant on what is in season. Great concept!",Date of visit: December 2016,Menu Gordon Jones,1,"Bath, United Kingdom"
Little piece of Spain,"What a great little place, firstly if you want to go you need to book and so glad we did. This little tapas bar only seats 20 ish people but has a great authentic atmosphere. All the staff are Spanish and are really enthusiastic. Lots of choice on the menu and details under each description where good and also gave details of where the dish is local to in Spain we thought this was a nice touch, out of the 8 dishes we ordered there was only 1 which we probably wouldn't go for again but that is more down to our taste than anything wrong with the dish its self. We love our tapas and been to many a tapas bar in Barcelona and Madrid and thought this was a great find in Bath.",Date of visit: December 2016,Ole Tapas,1,"Bath, United Kingdom"
Not Luxury but good basic base,"Recently returned back from the residenza Bourbon, these are sold through travel republic and there own website as luxury and although they are very clean and tidy both my husband and I both felt there where more a basic base rather than a luxury boutique place to stay. Being basic was fine for us as we did not spend a lot of time there that said there where a few things that could be improved, room was of good sized however needed a bit of tlc,first night our bed throw had a large bleach stain on it and all the walls round the room where badly scuffed marked wear and tear is part and parcel but it could be kept on top of. Furniture was also a bit battered. Bathroom was nicely finished that said on our 4 day stay we only had about 2 mins worth of luke warm water throughout the stay!! The ladies that own the hotel may have been just whilst we where there but we only saw them first day for 5 mins and last day as we checked out at this point to late to mention water issues. Breakfast is very basic if you like to load your self up ready for the day this breakfast won't offer you that but will tie you over if you like yoghurt fruit and some stale cakes. Location about 10 min walk to tremini station and 25 walk to Spanish steps. We wouldn't stay here again as I would prefer to stay some where that is manned all the time I found it a bit disconcerting that there was no one there all the time. However if you want a basic base in a nice location then this would suffice.",Date of stay: October 2016,Residenza Bourbon,1,"Rome, Italy"
Top notch,"What a great little find, small but perfectly formed came here on TA recommendations and we where not disappointed. Emailed in the morning to book a table and was very swiftly emailed back, if you want to go here you have to book as it's very popular with locals especially. Waiter looked after us and explained everything we where having. Nice menu and atmosphere we would defy one back.",Date of visit: October 2016,Pataclara,1,"Rome, Italy"
