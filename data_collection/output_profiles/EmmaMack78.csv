A must do whilst in Kefalonia!,"We had been recommended this fishing boat trip by family and it did not disappoint. A fantastic way to spend the day enjoying the sun, amazing views of the beautiful coastline and a lunch that wouldn’t look out of place at a five star seafood restaurant!
Great fun watching the nets being brought in to see what’s for lunch but fear not Antonia has a plan B should the nets be sparse. Lobster is guaranteed!
Bring towels and snorkels/goggles as whilst lunch is being prepared they set anchor in a cove for some swimming. We will definitely book up again next time we are in Kefalonia. Thank you to Antonia and her husband Michalis & Hassan for a fantastic trip!

Friday treat!,Visited this new cafe today to treat my son to an ice-cream as after school treat. He chose a chocolate & banana ice cream sundae with all the trimmings! The ice cream was delicious and the staff couldn’t be friendlier. Great coffee and the scones and cakes looked so tempting! Looking forward to returning again soon.,Date of visit: June 2019,Blether,5,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom"
Awesom way to see the sights of London!,I booked the Thames Rockets following a recommendation from a friend and it was by far the highlight of our recent trip to London. As a family of five ranging in age from 6 to 40years I was looking for something that would work for us all. Dave and Doug from Thames Rockets made everyone on board welcome and whilst highlighting all the important safety points - they added plenty of humour and fun facts too whilst cruising down the Thames. Once the speed boat passed Whopping we held on tight and Doug hit the accelerator! Just brilliant! Before we had even disembarked my sons all asked if we could book again on our next trip! We did lots of the usual sights and tourist attractions in London which we’re great but really nothing as exciting or fun as the Rockets! We will certainly be back!,Date of experience: July 2018,Thames Rockets,5,"London, United Kingdom"
Fabulous intimate wedding venue!,Can’t rate this restaurant enough as an ideal venue for private celebrations. The staff made everyone feel so welcomed and the whole evening went without a hitch. The food was sublime and staff friendly and efficient. Nothing was too much trouble and it’s clear Deans take pride in attention to detail from the presentation of their food to the excellent service from the staff. Would highly recommend the cheese soufflé and the cocktails are not to be missed! Thank you for making a family celebration even more special.
