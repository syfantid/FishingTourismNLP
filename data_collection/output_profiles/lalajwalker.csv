Wonderful Family Outing! Highlight of our trip,"Our whole family enjoyed this outing so much! Anthi and her crew were well prepared and knew so much and share all their knowledge with us! Our 9, 7 and 4 year old ALL enjoyed the trip! Anthi was great with the children and she even let them each be a ""captain"" and drive the boat! We experienced traditional Greek fishing, touched and learned about the fish, octopus, swam in the cove, saw the amazing Santorini sunset & had the most wonderful meal! 5 stars isn't even enough!",Date of experience: May 2018,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Excellent experience,"We came to the Bordeaux region and Saint Émilion for just a few days. We had 3 young kids with us and visited 4 Châteaus - this was by far our favorite and our kids favorite! It was well rounded ,personal and the wines are amazing and a great price !a must visit!",Date of experience: October 2017,Château Cantenac,5,"Saint-Emilion, France"
