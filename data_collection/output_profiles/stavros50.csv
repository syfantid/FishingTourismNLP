Fantastic birthday trip,"Saw this trip advertised as we were walking along the Harbour .
Did some checking and found it to be very highly recommended.
Paid the €20 deposit and went on our merry way .
Thursday ( my 50th birthday ) arrived and we were at the Jetty for 08:50 to fill in documentation and comply with COVID restrictions ( temperature test etc) .
Skipper of the boat met us and assisted with our and other guests boarding .
When all were seated he took us around the ancient harbour for great photo shots and then out to a fishing ground .
The first mate ( skippers wife) laid out bait and fished out rods and gear .
Scupper gave advice on what to do as well as safety brief on type of poisonous fish in these waters.
On completion we went at it .
Weather was great . A little swell in the water but great for fishing . I pulled four fish in ( much to my delight) . No record breakers but great sport.
Following a change of fishing ground, we headed south down the east coast of Rhodes.
Drinks were available throughout and acquaintances made with fellow fishermen.
Arrived in a secluded cove with sea caves and tied off .
Swimming and exploring were the name of the game as the crew prepared a feast of BBQ fish and Greek salad ( tasted fantastic).
On completion we headed North back to port .
A fantastic day out . Felt safe and secure throughout and have memories of a most wonderful day.
The price was very fair (€100 for two adults) and I would happily go again .
Fully recommend this to both novice and expert purely for the joy of the day.
Was very surprised when the skipper produced a chocolate cake with a candle and sang happy birthday to me ..... it’s the little things that count as well .
