Must do in Skiathos!,"We went on an evening fishing trip around 6:30pm - we saw the sunset and dolphins, caught some fish, saw the lunar eclipse and the rest of the amazing night sky. Straight after the trip, which took us to around 10pm, we went to a restaurant where our fresh fish was cooked for us and it was absolutely delicious. This was such a well thought out trip with refreshments and Dimitri was a great captain. Probably our best evening in Skiathos, I highly recommend it!",Date of experience: July 2018,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
Great sailing day trip!,"This was a very good trip - there were plenty of stops, a lot of swimming and snorkelling in caves. It was made even better by Theo and his wife who were really kind and welcoming. Refreshments were always flowing, lunch on the boat was delicious. We were generally well looked after. Thoroughly recommend this if youâ€™re after a solid day of sailing around the islands. Thank you Theo!",Date of experience: July 2018,Go4Sailing,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
