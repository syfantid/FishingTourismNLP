Υπέροχη Κυριακή,Η ατμόσφαιρα είναι καταπληκτική και από άλλη εποχή . Το φαγητό είναι αγνό παραδοσιακό και πεντανόστιμο.Το προτείνω ανεπιφύλακτα.,Date of visit: October 2019,Ksipetra,1,"Crete, Greece"
Amazing experience,Great Sicilian food in combination with the vibrant atmosphere and the friendly staff made the best combination for our dinner. Do not miss it once you are in Palermo . I highly recommend to make a reservation as the place is usually busy .,Date of visit: March 2019,Villa Costanza,1,"Sicily, Italy"
Full of sudden surprises,"After being recommended to visit the restaurant , I did not doubt that our staying would be more than pleasant . Unfortunately , we found a fly in our salad at the bottom of the plate . The reaction of the staff was not as apologising as it should and we were asked if we would like to have another one ( I suppose the other option would be to have the salad with the fly. ) .Apart from this there was a big delay in our order ( 50 minutes ) due to big turnover but take into account that the plates are not very sophisticated in terms of preparing , the delay was kind unjustified . The rest of the plates were just ok.",Date of visit: March 2019,La Prima Pizza Restaurant,1,"Crete, Greece"
Really sick after eating there,"To begin with , the atmosphere is very nice indeed . After eating there , 5/6 of us got very sick after 1 hour or 2 . Τhe prices realtively with other restaurants are very high and they did not worth the sickness.Recommended for a cafe or drink but not for food .",Date of visit: December 2018,Naguib Mahfouz Cafe,1,"Cairo, Egypt"
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,"If you want a personilized Egyptian experience , EMO tours is the right choice for you. Our tour guide , Marwoin , was exceptioanally friendly and gave us a lot of tips and info regarding the old and modern Egypt.It aslo should be mentioned the value for price , which is excetioanal . .",Date of experience: November 2018,Emo Tours Egypt,1,"Cairo, Egypt"
Seaside Gastronomic Experience,"From the welcoming to the end it was an unforgettable experience. The sea combined with the south cretan vibe can undoubtedly satisfy the most demanding one, not to mention the supere quality dishes that are based on cretan tradition with a sense of today . Highly recommended",Date of visit: September 2018,Pelagos Sea Side Restaurant,1,"Crete, Greece"
Unique Experience,"Mr Captain Giorgos was exceptionaly friendly, welcoming and nice . I lived an unforgetable experience in the blue aegean sea and I would undoubtably recommend it to everyone !!",Date of experience: June 2017,Captain-Giorgis Paros,1,"Paros, Greece"
