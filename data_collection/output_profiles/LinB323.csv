Fab day out,"We spent a wonderful day on the fishing boat wit, Michalis, Antonia and Nikki We kicked off with coffee and cake. That was a real treat. When the fishing nets were brought up it was a delightful catch this was going to be our lunch which was delicious. Everyone on board was happy to chip in and get the fish from the nets. While some of us went for a swim the family were preparing our lunch which consisted of lobster, crab, red mullet plus other fishes Greek salad, spaghetti there was more than enough for the 12 people on board and it was a delight to have Antonia and family joining us for lunch and enjoying hearing of the local knowledge which was helped down with homemade wine. From the moment we made contact to book the trip we were kept informed and the response was immediate if we had questions. All in all it was a great day we thoroughly recommend this trip great family. Itâ€™s a pleasure being around Greek people who we find kind and considerate. This trip I would like to do again.
