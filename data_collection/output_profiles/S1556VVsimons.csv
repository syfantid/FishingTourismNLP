Awful Food,"We went with friends, the roast pork was tough, cod and chips was dry and over cooked and the meager share of vegetables were passable.
The waiter asked if we would like more veg , we said yes ; the extra portion arrived after asking for twice over 30mins later over cooked and unpalatable ,
They were not busy either",Date of experience: December 2019,The Black Horse,1,"Sidmouth, United Kingdom"
An Excellent day out,"Thankyou to Michalis, Antonia and crew for a lovely day out on board their traditional greek fishing boat. We all had a wonderful time, I have my own fishing boat back in England where we catch fish by rod and line.
Nets were set for sardines which were later cooked on the bbq with swordfish, tasty scorpion fish all with salads and spaghetti and wine and beer; a true feast worthy of a top restaurant.
swimming off the boat was great all with the alluring backdrop of the Kefalonian scenery.
