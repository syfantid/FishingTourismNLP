We discovered the extraordinary sea caves of kleftiko and swim in their unrealistic blue sea, had lunch in a magical place with fish we had just caught and other delicious Greek food. Just to name a few memorable moments on this unforgettable day. Most of all, we were so well received by the captain and his family who welcomed us as guests and moved us with their kindness. If you want to experience Milos as it bests, Milos Fishing tour is a must!Expérience unique et magique. Nous avons été chaleureusement reçu sur le bateau « Milos FishingTrip » pour toute une journée. Nous avons découvert les caves extraordinaires de Kleftiko, avons nagé dans une mer d’un bleu irréel et avons déjeuné sur le bateau au milieu des caves des poissons que nous venions de pêcher. De plus, l’accueil du capitaine et de sa famille était d’une générosité et d’une gentillesse qui ont ajouté du bonheur à cette journée. Si vous allez à Milos, vous devez absolument faire ce tour"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/329katerinac,August 2020,5,Amazing and Authentic Experience ,"Captain Kyriakos is an authentic man and very joyful person and his daughter Tina was very kind.They are both very friendly and full of humor!! We went for fishing and caught many fishes!! Mr Kyriakos and his daughter Tina cooked the fishes and other tradiniotal greek dishes. They also provided delicious breakfast and fruits! The trip and the beaches we visited were amazing (Gerakas, Tsigkardo, Kleftiko) . The fishing trip is for maximum 10 persons therefore i suggest to book 2-3 days before. The most amazing and authentic experience!! Thank you so much Captain and Tina!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2020Marialena,August 2020,5,Greek hospitality,"One of the most unexpected experience than I ever had. These team , mr Captain Kyriakos and his daughter ,makes me feel the Greek hospitality. The trip was amazing, we swam in places with crystal waters evev if you could imagine. Last but not least is the experience that we had with the fishing on board. Mr Kyriakos did the unexpected made us to feel like we are expert in this. I love more Milos than before after this excursion. If I will visit Milos in the future, i will be sure that i will make it again."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18joer,September 2019,5,We Caught TOO MANY FISH!,"My girlfriend and I went on a fishing tour and we caught over 10 fish in 3 hours! We caught so many fish that we shared some of our catch with another fishing tour so that they could eat lunch. The fish were delicious, and the captain and his daughter were excellent hosts and guides! We had such a blast, would strongly recommend this to anyone interested in a beautiful trip around Milos, especially if you're looking to catch a lot of fish!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/882vikyp,November 2019,5,A Story of friendship !,"We arrived very early (4:50 am) in Milos port, no accomodation booked til then, no idea what should we do at this time, out from the ferryboat. First person we met in the habour was Kiriakos, the fisherman and his family on his boat Anna-Maria and he sold to us fresh fish!! We left at the end of November for a season end getaway. On top of that! If Kiriakos and his family had not been, we would probably have left the island of Milos again.... Kiriakos not only showed us the island with his big boat, but also provided us with fresh fish and salads on his boat for 4 days, as family. We heard very great and interesting stories and laughed a lot. We came as strangers and we left as friends. We thank you very much, Tina, Anna, Anna Maria and Kiriakos for this great time and that you have been there for us. You really saved our holiday!Of cause you can stay in Winter on Milos, with fishingtrips and alot of good food with Kiriakos and family !See you again, either back on Milos or in Crete!Love Vaggeli, Ari and Biky"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piratfritz,September 2019,5,Best Milos boat experience with fresh caught fish!,"Beat all the tourists and join this local boat (fishing) tour! We stopped along all the highlights of the west coast of Milos, caught fresh fish and fried them for lunch! A truly great experience that surpasses the other crowded boat tours by far!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vangelis0,August 2019,5,Incredible experience,This is probably the highlight of our trip to Milos. Nikos and his wife have developed an incredible idea that stands out from the canned boat tours you can book. 
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akallergis,August 2019,5,Fantastic trout by amazing people ,Would recommend this tour 100% great experience with great people. Thanks for a unique and memorable activity!
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CARochaPT,August 2019,5,Well deserved 5 stars!,"My family and I strongly recommend this activity. We have been on other greek islands of the Cyclades, and have had also quite wonderful boat rides, but this one was somehow different and surprising. Tina and her father take realy good care of you, one feels they have true pleasure in showing us their island, with no rush whatsoever. We had a delitious meal that they prepared on board, with fish that they also caught on board (the nets having been laid at dawn). We had time to snorkel at beautyfull Kleftikos, and other places, and our daughter (6 years old) had a great time fishing with a cane pole (as other children and teens on board, overjoyed with the actual experience of fishing). And yes, there was time for all of this (as I said, no rush whatsoever)."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theo_room,August 2019,5,Top experience,This is the best way to discover the beaches of Milos. You can't ask for more - eating fish you caught yourself freshly bbqed on the boar's very own grill after snorkelling in the crystal clear azure blue waters around Kleftiko! The fishing caique is authentic and so comfortable with plenty of room for our group and shade for everyone (we saw many boats crowded with people and were so happy we had made this choice). You are so well looked after by the captain and his daughter! The captain takes you to his special spots - we even saw endangered turtles and dolphins swimming with the boat! We recommend this as a MUST! Looking forward to doing this again the next time we are in Milos!
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smoesgaard,August 2019,5,"Great fishing, snorkeling and lunch ","We are a family with 3 kids age 5, 12 and 15 and we wanted to combine a sailing trip with fishing. This was absolutely perfect. Tina was very considerate about picking the best day for us (with the least wind). All kids caught a fish and loved the delicious lunch. We were only a total of 11 guests on the boat and that made it much more fun and personal and well worth the extra money rather than the crowded big groups. Another highlight was the sight of two dolphins swimming right in front of the boat. I highly recommend this trip!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AugoustinosKall,August 2019,5,Ever felt at home on a boat?,"When not taking you on a trip around the island with his daughter Ntina, Kyriakos is a fisherman. This trip is the perfect mix between a touristic hop between the unaccessible beaches of Mílos, the experiencing or Paragadi fishing, and the tasting of traditional fish soup (fresher fish, you die! You’ve just taken it out of the water!)Avoid the big boats. You’ll just spend the day with 30 to 50 other tourists. Let Kyriakos and Ntina share a bit of their daily lives.These guys are a bit hard to find, so look for them in the port of Adamantas! The boat is called Anna Maria (Kyriako’s granddaughter)."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonlZ7826TD,August 2019,5,Unforgettable day with the nicest hosts!,"My girlfriend and I went on the fishing trip with Tina and her father and it was the most wonderful day of our vacation. We went along the south shore of Milos and the views were breathtaking. We did snorkling in otherwise unaccessible locations, we fished the coast and we stopped in Kleftiko to have lunch with expertly cooked, freshly caught fish. Tina and her father are great cooks, the food was unbelievable. Please, do not skip on this incredible, almost private experience. I will never forget it!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/226francescop,August 2019,5,Bravo Anna Maria!!,"Unforgettable experience thanks to Tina and her father, the Captain, who put incredible passion in making people feel like they are part of the family rather than tourists. Amazing excursion, first class food (impossible to find fresher fish anywhere else on the island) and great fishing experience, both for kids and adults.If you are in Milos, do not miss this!!!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Digital_Skipper,August 2019,5,Fishing trip in Milos island,"My family and I joined captain Kyriakos and his daughter to a fishing trip in the south of Milos island two days ago. This was an excellent experience that we have enjoyed very much. With  a small team of another 7 people (12 in total) we have visited some of the most beautiful beaches of Milos island, some of them only accessible by boat, we swam in crystal clean waters and caves and we have tasted delicious seafood which we have catched ourselves while travelling from beach to beach. The children have enjoyed the trip so much that we have booked another fishing trip with the same boat for tomorrow at the north part of the island. With the assistance of captain Kyriakos each one of us catched a lot of fishes. It was really a memorable experience for all of us but especially for the children. The trip is strongly recommended for families with young children or teenagers who want to see the beautiful beaches of Milos and also experience the adventure of fishing. "
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elisap503,July 2019,5,Fantastic Day,"We had really fantastic time with this tour. We were ten people and it felt like having a private boat to ourselves to enjoy. The captain and the daughter are really nice people and the fishing part was good fun. The lunch , the fresh fished cooked on the boat, was amazing,plus there were many more thing to eat, from the cake in the morning to some snack before lunch and plenty of drinks. I appreciated a lot that the swimming stops were very long without any stricht time schedule and in spots that were a bit aside from where the other bigger boats. From what I have seen around, I believe this trip offers you something different from the other tours and it is really worth it particularly if you are more interested to enjoy a day on the sea more than making the tour of the entire island."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisC7713,July 2019,5,Real Greek Experience,"Best Greek experience you can possibly have from visiting the best beaches to the freshest fish and real Greek food. The family owned business (crew) is the warmest and loving people, that what to give you the best memories of Milos. Thanks again!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexpapachristo,July 2019,5,Our favorite day in Milos,My girlfriend and I decided to give this a chance because of the family and traditional vibe it gave us! Captain K. and his daughter were the best hosts we could ask for and made us feel like locals on the island! We fished and cooked fresh fish while we cruised at the best hidden spots and all the big attractions! The 8 other people that were with us were all friendly and the whole group was united for a family style adventure! This is a 100% no brainer for anyone who wants to live the true Greek island experience while also getting to see the touristic attractions! 
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinkasl,June 2019,5,"Great Fishing trip Adamas, June ,18 2019",We had a phenomenal fishing trip with Kiriakos and his daughter Tina. Wonderful people not only as “fishing bodies” but also a wonderful family.We visited many beautiful places and had a great lunch . You must experience it !!!!Greeeeaaat ️️️️️️️️J&P
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madelenegra,June 2019,5,Our best experience on Milos,"We wanted to go fishing on the island and came across this tour. It exceeded our expectations as we spent the whole day feeling like part of Tina's beautiful family as we caught fish, swam in crystal clear waters away from masses of tourists, and ate fresh grilled fish on the boat! It was such good value with the lunch included plus taking home any self caught fish.We were lucky enough to have a private tour as not in peak season and they tailored it to our every wishes.Those crystal clear waters of Kleftiko will be in my mind forever! Thanks to the whole family for such warmth and hospitality !!"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baptistec463,May 2019,5,A memorable day,A great and authentic experience ! We had a very nice day. Many thanks to Tina and her father for all they shared with us. You are so kind people. A real human experience Thank you for the excellent lunch !See you next time in Milos.Efharisto poli
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/knowlesy2015,May 2019,5,Fabulous day on the sea,"Thank you for a fabulous day on the sea with your family.  We had a great day, were well looked after and enjoyed the delicious food that kept coming all day.  Next time we will catch  that big fish!!!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S7882HWmichaelg,April 2019,5,Boat trip Milos ,"We highly recommend to do the trip. We were out for 7 to 8 hours. Exploring the west coast of the island, up to kleftiko. Fresh fish for lunch. Anchored in 3 bays and also could swim there. Very nice experience! "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smitas938,August 2018,5,Absolutely recommend,"The Milos Fishing Trip was the highlight of my vacation in Milos!! Tina and her father are wonderful hosts, and the small group size of 8 made the whole trip very personalized — this was a huge selling point. They also have an awning over the boat, and the shade was incredibly necesary given that it’s an 8-hour tour and (in the summer months) largely in the sun. Other tours weren’t as intimate and didn’t provide shade (and didn’t have the fishing component — which was really cool). Overall, I can’t give enough praise for this amazing tour!! I’d book this fast if you’re interested, as they’re known to sell out."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericsY1726WH,July 2018,5,Awesome Day Trip,We had a fairly large group of 11 and deliberated which boat trip we wanted to take around Milos for my father's birthday. This one was perfect!  Tina and her dad made us feel like family as they took us fishing and to Kleftiko bay for snorkeling and lunch. I'd highly recommend to anyone looking for an authentic mom-and-pop island experience.
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoardingPass406643,August 2018,5,Amazing boat experience,"We went there last August, we were a company of four (two couples), and totally six guests (i.e., the boat is not crowded). A very special boat trip with local fishermen in a very hospitable and warm atmosphere. We stopped by various majestic beaches of the island without rush, swam, fished, cooked, and had an awesome fresh fish lunch on the boat. Totally recommended."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RiteshP575,August 2018,5,Must do when in Milos!,"If you want to experience fishing whilst in Milos then we would highly recommend this family run, laid back fishing experience. We were met by Tina and her dad at the beginning of the day. They took us to picturesque coves as we made our way to Kleftiko bay. We stopped to swim in the gorgeous clear Aegean sea, around fascinating caves. A continental breakfast of toast, croissants and delicious cakes were served with a choice of tea/coffee. Our two boys explored the sea with masks provided before spending the afternoon fishing catching eldarado's. The boys were able to help clean the fish and Tina prepared an amazing lunch of fresh fish soup, grilled barracuda and greek salads with bread. We were provided beers, wine, ouzo, soft drinks and water throughout the day. In summary we would highly recommend."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dlias95,August 2018,5,Great experience,"Really layed back and family run boat.  You can fish,swim,chill at your own pace. No rush and you have meal on boat! If I come back here I will be looking them up and try to bring friends."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matteoramundo,August 2018,5,A magic experience,"A magic experience, no other words to define it!Not only because of the beautiful trip in the magnificent landscapes of Milos but mainly for the way the captain Kiriakos, Tina and the other nice man of the crew have committed themselves in making the trip something unforgettable for us.We were 2 families (8 people totally), the boat welcomes us very comfortably. We went fishing in the gulf, they’ve cooked a delicious psarosoupa (fish soup) for all of us. We also succeded in fishing 5 squids (!) that made our kids (and us) superexcited. They also grilled for us one of them! An authentic experience, not to miss!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Konstantina1202,August 2018,5,Fantastic trip,"We had an amazing trip with Tina and her father to the south part of the island of Milos. We visited 3-4 different beaches, including Kleftiko. We had an amazing lunch cooked on board with fresh fish that was caught the same day! Tasty fish soup and grilled swordfish together with Greek salad and many drinks that were included in the price we had paid. The best part was that we were a small group of 10 people avoiding a big crowd that makes things a bit difficult on a boat. I would definitely recommend it!"

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/847julietp,August 2018,5,Authentic boat trip,"What a day! We found this gem of a boat at the Adamantas port in Milos, after looking at many other options for a trip around the island and to the lovely beaches. Our initial impulse was to go on a sailboat- but they were fully booked. My husband and a friend found this little fishing boat, and spoke to the captain and his daughter. The boat will take 12 passengers, maximum. This appealed to us.  They take you to the most famous of the Milos beaches. They take you out to line fish - and then prepare the fish on board for lunch in the Kleftiko bay. A glass of wine, a spot of ouzo for the brave, some of the most heart tugging music by a fellow passenger- and our day was complete. It will remain in my  forever. Thank you to the staff for an amazing day."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lambrosm422,July 2018,5,Cool experience! Caught some fish!,"This is an amazing way to spend a day in Milos. Kapetan Kyriakos, his very nice daughter and the rest of the crew will go out of their way to make sure you have a great time. They allow a limited number of people on the boat so you really feel included in  planning the trip. Our party of four visited several cool beaches, ate fish soup prepared on the spot and of course did some rod fishing! Shoutout to Kapetan Kyriakos who is an amazing oldschool Greek guy and truly passionate about fishing. Lambros, USA/ Greece"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/macavallian,July 2018,5,Lovely day - lovely people ,"We had a fantastic day swimming - fishing - swimming - eating and more fishing , unfortunately no fish were caught today although a very large one snap the hook - we can not fault the skipper and his daughter and granddaughter - fun family day out with lovely fish dinner in kleftiko ! Don’t jump on a sailing boat with 16 people go fishing with 4 !!! "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sergenet,July 2018,5,Day long fishing/touring trip,"Words cannot describe the wonderful time we had on this boat. We started at 10 am and went around several breathtaking locations stopping for swimming and fishing. The captain and his crew went out of their way to please us. They cooked for us the catch of the day, a variety of fish, right there on the boat. It was the freshest and tastiest fish ever. My son Telly and daughter-in-law Paola, from Monterey, California, my wife Martha and I, from the Los Ageles area, had a fantastic time all day long. Never a dull moment. I love to fish and the captain would stop at different locations he has marked on his GPS and let me fish. The other three would jump off the boat and go swimming. Needless to say it was the best trip to Milos we ever had. We returned at 7 pm. They even had a surprise bithday cake for my wife. We certainly formed a good frienship that we plan on keeping by returning next year.  Highly recommend to anyone wishing a great time touring around the island of Milos in Greece."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephanielF9056DC,June 2018,5,Exceptional Fishing/Boating Experience - highly recommended,"We had an incredibly amazing time on the fishing trip that was arranged and recommended by our hotel.  The family was so generous and sweet. We had the best lunch and were entertained all day long. The swimming, fishing and boating were the very best. Most of all - they treated us like family. We highly recommend this adventure. We had a magnificent time. Rudy & Stephanie Lopez"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silverwz,June 2018,5,The best trip..,The most beautiful day on the island.the sea was great and food was amaizing.thanks for the best trip.
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KSFamily_12,May 2018,5,Wonderful Trip!,We booked this trip after the snorkel trip we had booked with another boat got cancelled. We could not have been happier and were very glad it worked out that we got to go with captain and his daughter. Our family wanted to snorkel at kleftiko but most boats couldn’t accommodate 10 people so we were very happy that we found this boat. We had brought our own snorkel equipment so it worked out to go on the fishing boat since they could make make it to kleftiko and another beach when other boats could not. Captain Kyriakos and his daughter Tina were so fun and kind and we all feel lucky to have got to spend the afternoon with them. They were great hosts and wonderful to talk with as well as taking us to the beautiful places to snorkel. Water was cold but welcome was warm. I would definitely go out with them again for any type of trip!!
