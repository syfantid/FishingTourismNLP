Excellent fishing tour in Santorini,"Captain Anthi and her crew are wonderful guides with deep knowledge of the art of fishing and love for their island. This tour was the highlight of our vacation, as we got to explore the real gems of Santorini, catch fish and the unique red tiny shrimp and enjoy authentic fisherman's cuisine. A must do while on the island, definitely suggest for family and friends and would gladly do it again.",Date of experience: August 2020,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Heaven!!!,"This place is heaven on earth.
A gorgeous hotel in a superb, serene location, only minutes away from the city center of Fira.
The views are incredible, from the south part of the Caldera to the north, there is nothing to interrupt your gaze to the volcano and the ocean.
The hotel itself, is luxurious, clean lines, crisp white walls and all marble terraces with colorful flower pots as a decor.

Upon arrival we met Antony, who offered us a welcome drink and information on our stay and the island.
Very thorough, very polite, a service that can easily be described as concierge.
Elizabeth walked us to and through our suite and escorted us to the terrace for a late lunch.
She was there for everything we needed, information, massage treatments, restaurant recommendations, even the best way to get to Mykonos on our departure date.
The food and wine was great, lots of options, especially the local wines and legumes(try the Santorini pasta).

The room was spacious, modern with touches of silver upon white walls and furnishings. Big bathroom with rain shower.
In general the accommodation was extremely clean and comfy.
Breakfast at our ocean view balcony was a delight. Freshly baked goods and different local delicacies every day.

Service was excellent, in a calming, reassuring way, from the porters to the reception staff, everyone knew what they were doing and what they were supposed to do for us.
I recommend the pick up service, queues for a taxi at the airport are huge and you do not know where they might drop you off.
Also the reception is excellent in suggesting and arranging for tours and places to visit. We booked a sunset cruise and a helicopter tour and highly recommend both.
Overall, this has to be one of the best places we have been fortunate enough to visit.",Date of stay: April 2017,Anteliz Suites,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Excellent tours!!!,"We initially contacted Resi for a 5 hour tour and we were so excited with our tour guide Putu that we ended up booking all our activities and transportation with him!! A funny knowledgable guide, willing to go over and above in order to satisfy your requests. Communicating and booking tours with Resi was a pleasure as they were always easy and prompt to reply. Thanks to Putu we had the most memorable and enjoyable experience in Bali!!",Date of experience: December 2016,Resi Bali Tour,5,"Kuta, Indonesia"
Exquisite hospitality at the Lokha!!!,"We had the most enjoyable stay in a 3rd floor suite at the Lokha last November!!! The staff is extremely polite and helpful. The location is excellent , with sweeping views of the Vos river and the rainforest. The distance to Ubud is a 20 minute magical walk along the rice fields, do try it either on sunrise or sunset. The rooms were extremely clean and twice services during the day.We definitely suggest the hotel spa, it was the best we tried in Bali!!! The only thing we would suggest is adding more regular routes to the center of Ubud with the hotel van.",Date of stay: November 2016,The Lokha Ubud,5,"Ubud, Indonesia"
Exceptionnal Fusion Dinner!!!,"We enjoyed a birthday dinner at La Maison in the middle of October after a recommendation from our hotel and we were highly satisfied by this choice!!! Great food in both appearence and taste, combined with attentive service from the super friendly and hospitable staff. We highly recommend it and would love to return here at any time.",Date of visit: October 2016,La Maison,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Great Sea Food Restaurant,"We enjoyed food at Savvas several times during our vacation in Santorini. The black sand beach in front of the restaurant is perfect for a dip prior to lunch. The food is amazing with many options on fresh fish and delicious starters(try the fried zuchini or the ray salad). Our server Markos and a young girl were extremely polite and helpful( showed us the fresh catch of the day, a huge red mullet that we had on the grill). Thank you guys and Piro for the great food and hospitality!!!",Date of visit: September 2016,Savvas Popeye Taverna,5,"Santorini, Greece"
