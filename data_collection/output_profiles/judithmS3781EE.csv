Kynren Experience,"A must go and see experience. Absolutely amazing, I went there with my husband and two friends and none of us were disappointed. I was blown away by the special affects and the cast of hundreds, mostly all volunteers. A standing ovation at the end of the hour and a half show, I won’t say anymore because it will spoil the whole thing, a reason why no cameras or videos are allowed to be used.

Before the show starts you can look round an authentic Viking Village and also grab something to eat and drink and for once none of the food or drink were stupidly expensive.

Would definitely go again, an experience not to be missed.",Date of experience: August 2019,Kynren,4,"Bishop Auckland, United Kingdom"
Two Night Stay,"We have never stayed in a Premier Inn before. We stayed here for two nights to go to Kynren. Such a good choice, everything you’d need. The staff were excellent and Yvonne in particular gave us such a lovely welcome and really helpful information about Kynren. Thank you, we wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again.",Date of stay: August 2019,Premier Inn Bishop Auckland hotel,4,"Bishop Auckland, United Kingdom"
Holiday Flight,"Very good flight, good leg room. Flight attendants very good, happy and helpful. The only criticism is that they didn’t stock their food. On the way out and back they had hardly anything left on their menu.",Date of travel: June 2019,Norwegian,4,World
Day Fishing trip,"Four of us are just back from a fantastic trip with Antonia and Michalis, their daughter Nicki and Hassan (I’m not sure how you spell his name ). What a first class day from booking on the Web, Antonia got back to me so promptly it was unbelievable, to getting back to the harbour at the end of the day. I don’t know where to start, they make you feel part of their family from the moment you step on board their lovely traditional fishing boat. The day started with coffee and cake whilst leaving the harbour on our way to picking up the nets. They caught Lobster and Sea Bream which was all prepared for a magnificent lunch, it was the best food we have had whilst in Kephalonia. If you do nothing else whilst there then this day is a must and we wouldn’t hesitate to join them again and in fact can’t wait to book again.
I can’t think of anything negative to say, it was just a glorious day with people who made you feel like family.",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Brilliant Meal,"Went for the first time to Indies last night. What a fabulous little place. A little bit of the Caribbean in Southampton. My friend and myself had the Mutton Curry, absolutely melt in the mouth and my husband had the Jerk Chicken which again he said was fabulous all topped up with a shot of Rum. Will definitely be going back.",Date of visit: December 2018,Indies,4,"Southampton, United Kingdom"
Great place for a drink,"Owned by a very charming linguistic Welshman. He sells Craft Beers from all over Greece and is very knowledgeable about all the beers he sells. The view from the outside area are simply stunning and lovely way to pass a few hours and meeting new friends. His collection of old scales, baby's cots and bed ends are also very interesting to see. All in all a very quirky place to have a drink at the end of a long hot day.",Date of visit: August 2018,Cafe Platanos,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
An amazing meal,"My husband and I went for an anniversary meal. We both reckon it serves the best Turkish food outside Turkey. Service with a smile, food very fresh and beautiful flavours. We've been twice now both times my husband had the Liver, the first time the Turkish Liver but this time asked if the chef could cook Albanian Liver, which he always had on holiday in Turkey and while this was not on the menu the chef had no qualms in cooking it for him and it was delicious and I can highly recommend the King Prawn Casserole. If you like Turkish food then you must pay it a visit.",Date of visit: August 2018,Anatolian Turkish Restaurant,4,"Bishop's Waltham, United Kingdom"
Great Flight,"We have flown with Virgin lots of times now and after flying with other airlines would always choose, where possible, Virgin. I am a very anxious flyer but these two latest flights were really good and I was probably more relaxed than I usually am. The food (you have a menu to choose from) was brilliant for in flight meals and so much of it as we flew during the day and a good supper and breakfast on the overnight flight home. The air stewards were so friendly and helpful we really couldn't fault it at all.",Date of travel: April 2018,Virgin Atlantic Airways,4,World
Brilliant holiday 21 April to 5 May 2018,"We have just arrived home from a fabulous holiday at this hotel. We cannot believe some of the reviews that have been written. We were in Building 21 and the people who were on the desk there were all very helpful and friendly these included Sadie, Carlos and Rafael and Yonatan, thank you for making our stay so nice. Lovely smiley people.

The food was first class, such choice, especially the Beach Club, the breakfast there in the mornings was superb, the service great, William was lovely so attentive and funny always made you feel special and the views across the water were the most amazing ever. The specialty restaurants were very good and we tried all of them and our favourites were the Oriental (the Fried Ice Cream was delicious) and the Pescador which is over the swim up bar both lunchtime and evenings was really lovely.

The grounds were meticulouly looked after and was a pleasure to walk round them and we did do a lot of walking as the complex is big. It was great being able to walk along with Iguanas and looking out for the monkeys in the trees. Everyone was so friendly and 'Hola' was constantly being said to us by any member of the staff that were passing. The staff were so friendly and we had such a laugh with quite a few of them. The bar staff was always helpful when not sure what to drink.

As the for the problems people have written about being pestered into buying timeshare or such, we were approached and didn't take up the offer but it was never a huge problem and weren't treated any differently after turning down.

It was a bonus having the pass to Xcaret, which we used often and well worth buying in with the hotel package.

All in all we had a FABULOUS holiday and wouldn't hesitate to go back.",Date of stay: April 2018,Occidental at Xcaret Destination,4,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico"
An Amazing Place,Well worth buying the pass when booking you holiday. It saves you a lot of money and you can't possibly see all the park during one visit.,Date of experience: April 2018,Xcaret,4,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico"
