Excellent trip,What can I say superb trip great hosts great food and drink nice easy fishing. We were out for nearly 5 hours typical Greek fishing boat stopped 3 places for fishing before dropping anchor for a swim while the fish were cooked on the barbecue on the boat served with Greek salad and wine or beer. Only 4 of us on the boat and still went out and really looked after us. I will definitely go back loved it,Date of experience: June 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"

Superb food.,"We have been eating at Nestors for about the last 10 years and have always had brilliant food. All the staff have been lovely. Last night we went to their new restaurant at the bottom of chipmunk mountain. Food service still amazing but now in a more beautiful setting. Nestors for us is still the best restaurant in Caleta, but it has very strong competition. Anyone booking all inclusive to Caleta is out of their mind.",Date of visit: January 2015,Nestor's Restaurant & Steakhouse,5,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
