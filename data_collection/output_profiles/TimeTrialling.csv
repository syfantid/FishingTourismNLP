Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,"We really enjoyed the day and intend to book next year when we return to Kefalonia.

My wife does not enjoy swimming but felt very safe throughout the trip. She is also fussy about cleanliness and was very impressed with how clean the boat was and the care taken in preparing the food.

Started with homemade lemonade and nibbles then watched the nets being hauled in with variety of fish. D & E took time to show us the interesting fish.

Visited two bays for snorkelling whilst fish was being prepared and cooked.

Delicious spread of freshly cooked fish plus fresh salad, her own potato salad and homemade wine. There was more food than we could eat!

I would recommend this to almost anyone. Perhaps too long if you have very young children.",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
