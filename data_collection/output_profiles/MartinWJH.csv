Farewell Dinner,"We had our last night dinner in Fiji at this stunning location and were certainly not disappointed. Our welcome on arrival was warm and sincere and we were shown to our superbly located table with a smile and a song! The food that followed was excellently prepared and well presented and attention to our table was tremendous.Before we left we were serenaded by a choir of all the staff who sang in harmony and cemented a perfect evening in a stunning setting. Highly recommended for that special,special occasion.",Date of visit: February 2020,Wicked Walu Seafood Restaurant,4,"Viti Levu, Fiji"
Sojourn in Paradise,"We recently stayed in this fabulous resort on the beautiful island of Fiji. I can not over state the qualities of this resort and location, everything from our first arrival to departure was handled professionally,with care and consideration.
The position of the resort on the Coral coast is idyllic and this immediately provided for a sense of relaxation and well being. The staff were welcoming,kind and courteous and carried out their duties to the highest standard.
The buffet breakfast provided was a particular highlight and it is difficult to imagine what they might offer that is not included in the range of choices available.
As much as I could continue to praise this extraordinary business in all it's facets I must pay particular attention to the staff who really went the extra mile to ensure our stay was enjoyed to the full. Their smiling faces and happy manner were a tonic and greatly appreciated by my wife and I and,I imagine, all other guests.
I wish all at the Warwick continued success and good luck with all you do and would definitely see you sooner than later if we were closer, however I sincerely hope I get the opportunity of visiting your wonderful facility again and indeed the amazing island of Fiji.",Date of stay: February 2020,Warwick Fiji,4,"Viti Levu, Fiji"

"Six Nations 2019 - Written by Martin Holland, Wales.","Fabulous venue in central Rome for watching rugby - we had a very warm welcome from our hosts on our several visits during our weekend stay for the Italy v Wales match on 09/02/19.
Food was good,space and seating was plentiful and attention to our table was great with nothing being too much trouble for the tirelessly hardworking Flavia who really is an asset to the business.

Pasta Perfecto!,"Superb authentic Italian in great location. I chose the ""Ragu di salsiccia con Pappardelle al Chianti Classico del Borgo Scopeto"" which was listed as Chef's speciality and it lived up to it's name, possibly one of the finest pasta dishes I have had the pleasure to sample.
Wine list good also, tiny restaurant but well worth the visit with personable and attentive staff. Highly recommended.",Date of visit: April 2018,IL VICOLETTO,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
"Comfortable,clean,convenient - Trinity !","Trinity City is superbly located for discovering central Dublin and especially for wandering through the Temple Bar area.The hotel is well appointed and maintained with all amenities of a good standard hotel provided.Staff were professional,friendly and helpful in particular Philip D the concierge for whom nothing seemed too much of a problem.
The hotel has a very attractive bar and inviting outside terrace with chairs and tables together with plenty of comfortable seating in the reception and ground floor spaces surrounding an unusual,enclosed, yet open topped quadrangle which enhanced the overall relaxed feel.
Breakfast was one of the few detractions and probably overpriced for that which it delivered however a minor criticism in the context of an overall very pleasant experience and stay at Trinity City Hotel. Definitely recommended.",Date of stay: April 2018,Trinity City Hotel,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
Great Service,"Bought the 48 hour pass on line which proved to be great value for money.Buses were plentiful, in good condition and punctual.Interesting also to experience the differing approach of each individual driver, overall good but Andy on the first bus Sun 22/04 was especially entertaining.Thoroughly recommended to help get a good feel for the city.",Date of experience: April 2018,Dublin Freedom Pass: Unlimited Transport and Hop-On Hop-Off Sightseeing,4,"Dublin, Ireland"

Group Visit,"I have recently returned with a group of friends(24) from Jurys Edinburgh.The hotel dealt admirably with the requirements of such a large group and all rooms were more than adequate.Breakfast was comprehensive and of a good standard with a good selection to cater for all tastes.We dined as a group on one of the evenings of our stay and this was dealt with extremely efficiently and offered a good choice at very good value for money. The hotel is very well situated to access the city centre and extremely convenient for the main Waverley railway station.
Overall impression very positive,one thought in passing whilst there was free wi-fi throughout which was much appreciated an IT facility available to guests would have been welcome for document printing and other ancillary administrative tasks.",Date of stay: February 2015,Jurys Inn Edinburgh,4,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Dublin Six Nations,"Recently returned from a three night trip to the Louis Fitzgerald hotel as part of an organised visit involving a group of 25. The hotel is of an excellent standard and everything from our arrival was well and efficiently handled from our first contact with their car parking concierge to the time we departed.As accommodation organizer I spoke with all of our group and found no one to be less than complimentary,indeed as a group we have traveled extensively supporting the Welsh Rugby team in for over 25 years and I am happy to say this hotel rates with the best in which we have stayed.Hospitality is first class,rooms well appointed,serviced daily and breakfast comprehensive with the much appreciated feature of having eggs individually prepared to order.
LF Hotel is linked commercially to the nearby Joels Restaurant and this too was well worth a visit for excellent food at reasonable prices, complimenting the in-house dining room at the hotel particularly well and providing a convenient alternative.
LF is of course situated outside of the city centre but a practical and amenable courtesy bus was on hand and readily available.
Many thanks Louis Fitzgerald and staff from New Quay Wanderers !",Date of stay: February 2014,Louis Fitzgerald Hotel,4,"Clondalkin, Ireland"
1 night away,"Visited Penhelig on a Sunday in January,found to be very welcoming and friendly. Stayed in a dog friendly room with our pooch and were impressed with the accommodation offered,the bar was also dog friendly and was very convivial. We were especially impressed by the staff who were attentive & friendly.At breakfast, where a comprehensive selection was on offer,the young man who singlehandedly serviced a busy dining room though under some pressure remained both efficient and humorous and was a credit to the business-best wishes to him on his forthcoming trip to Australasia ! Altogether a very pleasant experience and would recommend to anyone, thanks - Diolch yn fawr !",Date of stay: January 2014,Penhelig Arms,4,"Aberdyfi (Aberdovey), United Kingdom"

"Superb location,great service","This hotel is ideally located for sights of central Rome with most of major attractions within easy walking. It represents quality accommodation at great value price and the service & courtesy of staff was excellent. Rooms were serviced daily and always clean & tidy. Some rooms have better views than others we were favoured with a skyline view of the city which was fabulous early morning & under moonlight ! Breakfast was plentiful and a good selection of hot & cold, personally we did not use the evening restaurant but some of our co-travellers reported favourably. En suite was good and roomy & safe in room big enough for laptop etc. A suggestion would be to include a kettle in the room though the mini bar was comprehensively stocked and inexpensive. Wifi throughout the hotel was inconsistent and offered intermittent service.
Overall a very pleasant well presented hotel offering great value for money which I have no problem in commending & would happily stay again. Particular thanks to Giuseppe on reception for all the assistance in dealing with our group booking and making us feel so welcome !",Date of stay: February 2013,Hotel Hiberia,4,"Rome, Italy"
Krakow Christmas,"Quite simply this hotel must be one of the cosiest, homeliest,professionally presented that I could wish to visit. Attention to detail by all the staff from the moment of our arrival to our departure was great, rooms were well sized,clean and featured endearing touches such as the decanter of cherry vodka welcome drink overlooked by a small teddy bear sitting on the bed !
The second day of our stay was St. Nicholas Day (6th. Dec) a day of gift giving in Poland and in the morning hanging from the handle of each bedroom door was a beautifully wrapped bar of Swiss chocolate - this thoughtful gesture summed up the service level provided at The Amber.
Free WiFi is available, a sauna and multi gym are provided on the lower ground floor and the ground floor restaurant where a comprehensive choice of breakfast was on offer also provided a varied evening dinner menu. Yet another useful and individual touch was the daily hotel newsletter on each table at breakfast outlining basic information on the city and some ""whats on"" suggestions.
This hotel provides complete value for money and is ideally situated for exploring the beautiful Old Town, trips further afield being readily booked from reception.
We traveled as a group of 5 with age range 19 - 64 and were all very impressed by Hotel Amber and are happy to give a recommendation of the highest order whilst already planning our next stay !",Date of stay: December 2011,Amber Hotel,4,"Krakow, Poland"
