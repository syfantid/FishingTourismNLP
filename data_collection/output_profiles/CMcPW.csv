Best trip of the holiday,"Giorgos is one the nicest Greek Sea Captains I’ve ever come across – it doesn’t count that I haven’t met another before!

I had seen the trip on Facebook and really fancied it. If you do the trip as a private large group booking, it is fantastic value for money!

Giorgos is very helpful in accommodating everyone’s needs on board, we booked as a group of 11 of all ages and abilities and the trip was fantastic from start to finish.

We were a bit dubious about stepping on board a fishing boat and imagined all sorts! How very pleasantly surprised we all were. The boat looks brand new! It is so clean and tidy you would think it was someone’s home!

The crew Giorgos, Sadek & Vaso look after you like you are family, it really is 5 star treatment!

The food on board was by far the best meal of our whole vacation! We had fresh baked traditional pastries, fresh fruits, Greek coffee, fruit juices, salad, olive oil, calamari spaghetti, freshly caught fish, bruschetta and wine – ALL homemade and simply delicious! SO much food was available; they do NOT let you go hungry (this was a concern of mine and I always carry snacks).

Vaso prepares all the food and drink on board and keeps it all flowing whilst keeping on top of cleaning the boat, the slightest drip is soon cleaned up.

Sadek is a professional fisherman and knows his stuff; he showed my son all the fish they caught and let him help get them off the nets and hold them.

Giorgos is a fantastic, fisherman, captain and friend. He is full of information about the local island and surrounding areas. His personal background is very interesting and he is very knowledgeable.

We snorkelled, swam and dived off the boat and we all thoroughly enjoyed it! The fish you see in the beautiful spots he takes you to are breath taking. We even saw a family of seals! The little private beach is beautiful and they will supply you with dry boxes to put your stuff in when you swim out to keep your phone, towels etc. dry.

The fishing part was a little rocky for me – I had to lie down whilst the nets were put down and pulled back in. I also felt a little rocky for a day or 2 but that has not put me off and I will definitely return on Giorgos boat next year when we return. The rest of our party on board were fine (I must be a light weight).

If you forget anything on board, I’m sure Giorgos will help you out, he leant us dive masks and floats and I also charged my phone up whilst on board.

There is a shower and toilet to use, which like the rest of the boat is spotlessly clean!

If you have any questions at all get in touch with Giorgos and ask, he is very helpful!

An absolutely fantastic trip, comes highly recommended and a must do whilst visiting the island of Zante!",Date of experience: August 2018,Zante Fishing Tours,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
First family visit - very impressed,"I booked this hotel purely on the trip advisor and Facebook reviews, my friends and family had also booked this hotel at the same time so there was a lot riding on my recommendation! Danny’s did not disappoint! We stayed for 2 weeks in August 2018 as a family of 4, 2 adults, one 14 year old and one 6 year old. We were put in room 112, overlooking the pool and pool bar. This room was more than big enough for all of us. We had twin beds pushed together for the adults, sofa bed made up and camp bed made up. All beds were comfortable for all the family.

The room has basic self-catering equipment, 2 rings, fridge, kettle, toaster cups, plates etc. I read someone complaining about the small size of cups in the room! Just go and ask at the bar and they will give you a mug! Simple!

Now the rooms do differ slightly due to it being 2 hotels merged into one and there is also a new block with superior rooms. Ours was basic and a little worn but my parent had superior room and this room was beautiful, very modern and fresh. Saying that, all you do is wash and sleep in them and they all have the same facilities so this is not an issue.

If you need ANYTHING at all whilst on your holiday just speak to Yanni, he is the busiest person in the world but he always makes time for his customers and will help out with anything at any time!

We needed a blanket in the middle of the night for one of the kids (hubby insisted on aircon on full blast) and Yanni went to cleaners store to get one for us.

My son’s dive sticks went “missing” from around the pool side and Yanni got my son a new set.

As a group of 11, we were always made to feel welcome and got to know all the staff very well.

One of our party had a birthday whilst there and Yanni arranged for an area to be set out with our banner, birthday music playing and complimentary Prosecco! (Got a beautiful Ferrero rocher birthday cake from Sweet Memories)

The food at the pool bar is amazing! We ate here most days for breakfast and snacks, we drank here everyday and made the most of free shots and peanuts. The power of free nuts is super powerful and kept us on our seats drinking and playing games until the small hours.

The location of Dannys is good, lots of fabulous bars and restaurants a small stroll away. I have to mention Busters at the top of the road this bar does the best cocktails and the staff are fantastic!! Anna, Ollie and Spiros will keep you well entertained and fuelled up with plenty of free shots!

The cleaner came round every day and she changed our bedding and towels every third day. Toilet roll was put in every day however some of our group complained theirs wasn’t, must be depending on which cleaner you get – just speak to Yanni if this is a problem.

All the staff here works very hard, they must survive on the smallest amount of sleep as they are always up and about being very busy.

The bar pool is lovely, we were there every day but never used the quiet pool (this pool looked nice though). Sunbeds can be an issue; I saw towels out as early as 6am!! However it was never a real issue for us as we kept an eye on the beds and timed them, if they were empty for 2 hours we just folded the towels up and put them all on one bed. No one really challenged us about this, however we did get one slight under breath comment about it being a “bit rude” but I think it’s ruder to try keeping a bed all day when they are not there!

The shop at Dannys sells everything and we often bought snacks and drinks from here. If you want to save a few quid and want to stock up go to the big super market on the left hand side of Jammin bar in town.

Transfer from airport: we arrived and left on a Wednesday, we only had 3 stops on the bus there and back and it only took half an hour. Very smooth and easy!

Some of our friends arrived on a Thursday and it took them over TWO hours to get to and from airport! This was not fun for them at all. This seems to be a busy Thursday thing, so we advised our family coming out to jump in taxi. This was a much better option, just check with your rep when you arrive how busy the bus is and where it is stopping at. If you are prepared to spend 28€ you will get there much quicker!

You won’t be disappointed if you book this place, you get out of a holiday what you put in. The Greek people are so friendly and welcoming, if you are polite and pleasant to them they will show you the best time with the best hospitality.

I could go on and on about Alykanas but if you want to know more there are fantastic Facebook pages with loads of info from all the regulars.",Date of stay: August 2018,Danny's Hotel,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Great weekend away - nice and clean hotel.,"We had a fantastic long weekend visit! The kids loved it age (11 & 3) & so did the adults. We found the queues weren't too long if you take advantage of the free fast track passes, they give you an allocated time to come back to save waiting in that massive queue. They also do a free baby swap pass, so when you have been on a ride that's too big for the little ones, you ask for a baby swap ticket when you get off ride and you give it to your partner who gets to go to the fast pass queue with your bigger child and ride again without queueing! This is a fantastic idea and my daughter got to ride all the big ride twice! We also took advantage of the free half board offer and this saved us a fortune. We stayed at Disney Santa Fe hotel and the all you can eat breakfast & evening meals were really good! Tip for breakfast book in an early slot 7am as after 8am it gets rammed! Included was a free t time treat for us all, between 3-6pm we were allowed to pick either a magnem ice cream or sugared doughnut and a hot or cold drink. We didn't buy any food at the park as we took plenty of snacks in our bags and with breakfast and dinner included we were sorted. I would definitely recommend a visit here if you have never been, this was my second visit in 5 years and I think I would at coming back in approximately another 5 years. Keep up the good work Disneyland Paris!! xx",Date of stay: April 2015,Disney's Hotel Santa Fe,4,"Coupvray, France"
