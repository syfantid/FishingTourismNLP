What a fantastic place!,"Arrived at Metro and was greeted by friendly staff, such a warm and cool vibe! Food was delicious and well priced. Lots of choices on the menu, gluten free and vegan options so will cater for all. Place was noticeably very clean and there was a good atmosphere with lots of other customers! Would definitely visit again - 5 stars all round!",Date of visit: September 2019,Metro Lounge,5,"Amersham, United Kingdom"
BEST DAY EVER IN KEFALONIA!,"Where do we even begin. We have been on this trip with Efi, Dimitrious and their crew member Mohammed now for 3 years in a row! And each year we have enjoyed it more and more when we have thought this was impossible. This trip is fantastic for all ages with something for everyone. As they reel in the morning catch Efi is a fantastic teacher, explaining about each fish as they appear in the nets - and what a range of fish there are!! We have seen octopus, parrot fish, pork fish and fly fish just to name a few. Once the catch is in, you get to jump off the boat and into the amazing blue waters and enjoy a swim. On the second stop Dimitrious swam with us to the shore where he showed us natural clay, covering his head in it and then dipping the wet clay into small stones showing us his new hairdo leaving us all in fits of laughter. All whilst Efi and the crew are busy preparing a 5 star lunch from the catch of the day. Not only is the fish the MOST DELICIOUS fish we’ve had from our stay on the island, but it comes along with fresh tomatoes, and herbs from Efi and Dimitrious’ own garden along with homemade wine and lemonade! They make you feel so welcome and are the best hosts we could have asked for, from not knowing them before our trip 3 years ago to now calling them firm family friends! We can not recommend this trip highly enough and if you’re unsure just go for it - you will not regret it!",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
