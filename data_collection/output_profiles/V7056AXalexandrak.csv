Best fishing trip of my life!,"I feel incredibly happy I had the chance to do this trip with Dimitris! I've travelled in almost 15 islands in Greece and done many boat trips, but this is the one I'll never forget! Dimitris is the coolest guy I met in Skiathos! He treated us very nicely and he knows everything about Skiathos and fishing! I had the chance to swim in wonderful beaches and fished for the first time in my life! I fully recommend this trip! It's a once in a lifetime experience! Don't miss it!!",Date of experience: July 2017,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
Coolest bar and juice bar ever!,The most alternative bar in Chania! I fully recommend it to those who love juices! But if you're seeking a refreshing cocktail on the street the Bazaki can be a great choice! And I have to say that the owner was the coolest guy ever! If you visit Chania for any reason make sure not to miss this spot! Just loved it!,Date of experience: June 2017,Bazaki,5,"Crete, Greece"
