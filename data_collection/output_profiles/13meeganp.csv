SIMPLY THE BEST!,My husband and I spent 3 perfect days with Jorge and couldn't be happier. We wanted a more personalized experience during our time here. Jorge is extremely intuitive as to your adventure and activity level and is always offering excellent options and activities tailored to you interests. We joined him as his guests at a local concert. We recommend him highly!,Date of experience: June 2019,Furnas Volcano,5,"SÃ£o Miguel, Portugal"
Wonderful stay- love Sergio!,"Fabulous trip! Outstanding facilities and genuine staff. LOVED Sergio at the Sports bar. What a gem! Relaxing trip- huge property. Never feels crowded. Great tours arranged through the hotel.

Best trek company! Look no further.,My husband and I went with this company because my uncle spent a month trekking with them in Nepal before we did. They certainly did not disappoint and went above and beyond what we ever expected. Trekking with them exposed us to the culture and gave us a variety of experiences we never would've had. There was Maoist activity at the time of the trek and they made us feel very safe. Especially beneficial when there's a language barrier and especially beneficial when there's a language barrier and confrontation. confrontation.Hands-down the best experience ever! Look no further and book this company :-) I have been in touch over the years with then I have been in touch over the years with them and Basu is like extended family. We plan to take out kids back when they're old enough,Date of experience: April 2017,Adventure Himalaya Nepal,5,"Kathmandu, Nepal"
Your kids will be hooked!,"Let me start by saying I don't write reviews, but Tampa Fishing Charters is phenomenal. My sons, ages 8 and 10, LOVED the week long fishing camp they did over the summer. They begged me to do a charter and it was above and beyond anything we expected. The guides are exceptional with the kids. Great guides. SO interactive, funny, and with a knowledge of fishing that impressed my husband who grew up in Florida and has fished his whole life. How do they know where to go and get so many fish each time? Just awesome.",Date of experience: September 2017,Tampa Fishing Charters,5,"Tampa, Florida"
LOVED IT! BUT know what to expect,"This was a wonderful experience for my husband and I and our two boys, ages 8 and 10. KNOW this is traditional fishing with nets, pots and SMALLER fish. One of the people on our boat expected deep sea sports fishing and was disappointed. If you want that, and catching big fish, Giorgaros does private outings or this but you need to specify that. We were very happy to have great hosts, great food, beautiful scenery, pull up shrip, fish etc and enjoyed it immensely! Just know that if you want BIG fish, you need a private charter with them and book appropriately.",Date of experience: July 2017,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
