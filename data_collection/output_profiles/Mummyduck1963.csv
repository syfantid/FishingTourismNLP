Brilliant night,"Spent few nights here whilst in Benidorm & it’s the best! Cheap drinks, great acts & friendly staff all add up to making this place as brilliant as it is. Bingo each night too. Had great laughs & many sing alongs. I’d highly recommend it",Date of experience: October 2018,Tommy's Bar,1,"Benidorm, Spain"
Breathtakingly beautiful,"Absolutely loved this site! Not 1 single fault with it. Location-perfect, amenities-perfect, staff-perfect, cleanliness-perfect! Il 100% be returning. Beach walk is really nice way to get to harbour & not a difficult walk either. Crail is a beautiful little village, the cottages are great!",Date of stay: August 2018,Sauchope Links Caravan Park,1,"Crail, United Kingdom"
Scrummy,"Traditional fish supper & it was lovely, nicely battered haddock & chips. We opted for mushy peas option & these too were v nice. The cafe was v busy on the Thursday night but well worth the wait for a table!",Date of visit: August 2018,Crail Fish Bar & Cafe,1,"Crail, United Kingdom"
Very poor!,"I made arrangements & was told 20euro reduction for my 10yr old however once on board was told full price as there was a rod for him, 1st time anywhere in the world Iv been told that! Set off well when we went fishing for bate & for 30mins we all had a go at fishing, we then set off on the trip where we all sat & watched the rods get set up & put into holders, we were driven around for a while with no fish what so ever. These rods where then taken down & other rods set up & put into holders all while we sat & watched! 1 rod was then set up & we were told we could share that 1 round if we wanted a turn! No fish again so we all sat & watched as the rods where packed away & we were brought back. 1 person asked if they could use the toilet to be told it wasn’t working & could they just pee over the side! Very poor show & goes top of my list for fishing trips I won’t be using again-sorry!",Date of experience: July 2018,Gavin Glen Fishing,1,"Tenerife, Spain"
Beautiful,"After a mornings fishing the bosuns breakfast certainly hit the spot! Lovely food, well cooked & extremely friendly owners & staff. Even bought big fat homemade cake to take out. Can highly recommend this place!",Date of visit: May 2018,Bosun's Locker,1,"New Quay, United Kingdom"
Awesome!!!!,"Had a fantastic fishing trip with these guys, never been on such a clean, tidy fishing boat. Staff where extremely helpful & informative. Couldn’t have picked a better day as even the weather was fab! Highly recommend & my only complaint was they’re booked up so I can’t go again this holiday!",Date of experience: May 2018,Epic Fishing Trips,1,"New Quay, United Kingdom"
Very poor!,"After reading the revues we decided to try here for a holiday treat meal out & oh how I wish I hadn’t bothered! I can’t believe Iv been to the same place. We were shown to our table, not hard as every other 1 was empty, & given menus, no mention of garlic bread so I asked to b told il bring u the specials board, along it came with 2 starters & 2 mains 1 of each was sold out & still no garlic bread! The waitress eventually sorted this & out came 3 slices of crusty bread with oil poured ova! Yuk! My meal was tasteless as was my sons & the portions were tiny! Complete waste of money & don’t really understand where these reviews are coming from coz I certainly would never return!",Date of visit: May 2018,Rossini,1,"New Quay, United Kingdom"
Great experience,"I visited this attraction with friends 1 of whom was a pensioner but because of the layout extra it didn’t make any diff with the ease of getting around. Must admit I was there on a coach trip & didn’t know a lot about it, after checking on trip advisor I didn’t know if to go on the boat as it had v mixed reviews however we decided as we were there we would & it most certainly didn’t disappoint! It’s a marvellous structure & v diff from anything else Ul go on. Wen u reach the top it’s just like entering a surprise world. Defo recommend it, don’t know what the people who said it was boring expected, a fairground ride it definitely isn’t but u r not on it long enough to get “bored” either. Lots of views all the way along.",Date of experience: April 2018,Falkirk Wheel,1,"Falkirk, United Kingdom"
A must,"Lovely experience seeing these, it was very busy while we were there but plenty of room for everyone. A close up is a must to appreciate the work which has gone into the structure. Easily accessible & open space. Cafe had a wide variety at reasonable prices. I would like to go back to experience them at night too.",Date of experience: April 2018,The Kelpies & The Helix,1,"Falkirk, United Kingdom"
1st class service,We booked our trip last minute but this certainly wasn’t a problem & the lady on the desk was very helpful. Bus arrived on time & was a comfortable ride. We visited both museums & the driver was very accommodating on both parts. We had already booked our airport transfers but will request a quote for future reference. Would definitely recommend 10/10,,From Kraków: Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum Tour,1,"Krakow, Poland"
Perfection,"Well betullas of ulverston u excelled last night!!! We went for hubbys birthday, breaded Camembert for starter to share which was lovely, served with sliced crusty bread, cranberry relish & side salad beautifully presented. I had pre ordered the seafood platter & it didn’t disappoint! It was amazing,
Iv only ever had as good abroad. A bottle of house wine was included & we settled for rose which was once again v nice! No room for puds I’m afraid but wil defo b returning & would highly recommend to any other shellfish foody. Staff were also a credit, very friendly, polite & attentive! Well done all round 10/10",Date of visit: November 2017,Betulla's,1,"Ulverston, United Kingdom"
Lovely stay,"We had planned a day trip to skipton so decided last minute to stay over night, travelodge was ideally situated & a reasonable price. Didn’t arrive til late & left early next morn so only really made use of the bed which was clean & comfortable. Farm shop next door Defo worth a visit & was unfortunately too busy for breakfast but never mind il just need to go again!",Date of stay: October 2017,Travelodge Skipton,1,"Skipton, United Kingdom"
Excellent,"Comfy clean room, excellent breakfast inc the poached eggs when ordered. Very hard to find the car park but token given for parking which was an added bonus! Only downfall was temp of the room which affected my nights slp.",Date of stay: August 2017,Premier Inn Sheffield City Centre (Angel Street) hotel,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Fab location,"Recently stayed here for a few days with 2 children 7 & 9, great location would highly recommend. Apartments although not massive are big enough for a few days. Very clean with balconies. My only dislike was the sofa bed in the lounge (which we used & gave the children the twin bedroom) wasn't v comfortable. I agree with other reviewers who say staff can b quite noisy in the morning. The rooftop pool is situated across the road at the avenida hotel. The water was freezing but the view amazing!",Date of stay: April 2017,Apartamentos Avenida,1,"Benidorm, Spain"
Good Location & nice clean room,Good room added bonus was USB port next to yr bed! Bfast was hot & plentiful & after asking for poached eggs they were presented cooked to perfection. Staff v helpful when we were asking about taxis & places to eat. Good hot shower.,Date of stay: February 2017,Premier Inn Sheffield City Centre (Angel Street) hotel,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Perfect evening,"We stayed here as a valentines treat & it was perfect! It's only a 30min drive from home but it could have been anywhere. We had a meal in the restaurant 1st which was delicious. 12oz steak cooked to perfection with a side order of peppercorn sauce which was rich & tasted lovely. We then had a double room booked which again was perfect! Lovely decorated, nice & warm & considering it's on a busy road was very quiet. Peaceful night all round & defo 10/10",Date of stay: February 2017,Rusland Pool Hotel,1,"Haverthwaite, United Kingdom"
Birthday party,"10 of us went here for a birthday party, we had pre ordered our meals so it was v straightforward when we arrived. The meals were served quickly & every1 agreed we all enjoyed what we had chosen. The same applied with our main meals all been served efficiently & hot food all round. I opted for the prawn cocktail started which was just right followed by the mixed grill which was once again cooked to perfection, very large portion which I had no chance of finishing but thoroughly enjoyed what I did manage & would defo choose again! Great night as agreed by the whole party",Date of visit: January 2017,The Custom House,1,"Barrow-in-Furness, United Kingdom"
Beautiful food!,"Called here today for lunch & it was great. I chose the Cumberland sausage which is locally made & it was gorgeous. My partner chose off the special board which was steak fajita burger, this too was lovely. Child & dog friendly, a lovely friendly country pub with a gr8 menu. Definitely call again & would recommend",Date of stay: December 2016,The Brown Cow Inn,1,"Waberthwaite, United Kingdom"
Faultless!,"Just spent a week here with a group of girlfriends, my 1st time in Benidorm & I cert wasn't disappointed! The hotel was lovely, rather small bedroom but had everything we needed & was clean on arrival & every day afterwards. Lifts to all floors. The hotel was in a great location & easy to walk to the beach, shops & restaurants. Pool was really cold but surrounding area was clean & plenty of sunloungers. Food was exceptional always varied, plentiful & hot. Disappointed no water was provided you had to buy a bottle if u wanted it with your meal & tea was only available for breakfast. Staff were helpful & polite",Date of stay: October 2016,Servigroup Venus,1,"Benidorm, Spain"
Old town,"Well worth a visit when in Benidorm, lovely quaint streets lined with tapas bars & little shops. Promenade was lovely to walk up & the viewing points at the top of the large hill are well worth it. The old church is definitely a must!",Date of experience: October 2016,El Casco Antiguo de Benidorm,1,"Benidorm, Spain"
Anniversary meal,"Went here for an anniversary meal & it was lovely! It's been many many years since I last went & standards were high. The interior of the restaurant was v nice & staff were helpful & attentive esp the tall blonde waitress (sorry didn't get her name) is a credit to the hotel, Polite & knowledgable. After our meal, the mussels were lovely by the way, we took our coffee into the lounge, another well decorated room with magnificent large fireplace. We will defo return to this hotel with lovely surroundings, beautiful food & nice staff with value for money, what more can u ask for!",Date of stay: September 2016,The Clarke's Hotel,1,"Rampside, United Kingdom"
Great weekend,"Just spent a long weekend here with a large group of friends & it was great! Rooms although quite small (we had a twin) had everything we needed, were v clean & nicely decorated. We arrived Friday afternoon & check in was v straight forward. We went for tea & I have to admit it was dire! We already decided we'd b eating elsewhere from then on however sat morn came & we went for bfast expecting nothing at all & it was beautiful! Not v large but tasty & hot, we were pleasantly surprised & from then on the meals got better & better! Shame theyv decided to stop the all night 99p bar (1 of the reasons we chose the particular hotel) it now finishes at 5pm. Entertainment was what u expect from a seaside hotel but not bad. Not a bad hotel at all.",Date of stay: September 2016,The Royal Alexandra Hotel,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
Paradise,"Just back from 10 days here, my 1st visit, it was perfect! From the welcome u receive on landing at male airport to leaving was fantastic. Upon arriving on the island the drums play to welcome u, a warm towel & welcome drink is provided. U r shown to yr room then all cares of the world disappear-along with yr shoes which don't see the light of day until u leave-bliss! We booked a garden bungalow which was v nice but quite a way out & a bit dark so upgraded to a beach bungalow which was perfect. The view even from your bed was amazing. The outdoor bathroom comes as a surprise at 1st but even that works perfectly. Food was always plentiful, varied & hot. Staff couldn't b anymore helpful than they were in all areas. My 9yr old loved the fishing trips we went on & the snorkelling was good. If I had 1 complaint to make it would b the 8hour wait at the airport for our return journey home! I'm sure they could arrange seaplane transfers better so our last day wasn't spent sitting in a stuffy airport lobby waiting to check in. Leaving the island at 1.30 for a 10.45 flight is just not acceptable",Date of stay: August 2016,Kuredu Island Resort & Spa,1,Kuredu
Beautiful!,Stayed here for the night with hubby & 8yr old son & it's beautiful! Hotel & grounds v well maintained & staff were v polite & cheerful. 1st stop was the swimming pool which was well equipped & spotless. Bfast was hot & plentiful. Highly recommended esp in nice weather when u can have a walk round & truly appreciate the grounds & flower displays!,,Worsley Park Marriott Hotel & Country Club,1,"Worsley, United Kingdom"
Very impressed,"Had a lovely meal here tonight, the best Iv ever had there! 5 children & 3 adults in our party but nothing was to much trouble for the staff, v friendly & helpful. Food was nice, plentiful & served hot even though it was v busy. V impressed & il defo return!",Date of visit: July 2016,The Owl & The Pussycat,1,"Barrow-in-Furness, United Kingdom"
Superb experience,"Privately hired this boat for an evening fishing trip for myself, my wife & my 8yr old son, from beginning to end it was fantastic! Both owners where so helpful & nothing was too much trouble. We caught plenty of diff variety fish & watching the sunset was to die for! We ended up fishing in completed darkness so on our return journey just sittin watching the stars & then all the towns lights appearing was magical. Cannot recommend this trip & was a perfect end to our perfect holiday!",Date of experience: May 2016,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Fantastic!,"Just had a short break in Skiathos staying at the Morfo hotel & it's been fantastic! Hotel is tucked away in a lovely & quiet little st yet minutes walk away from the town-best of both worlds! We had a triple room for myself, wife & son & it was exactly as we would have wanted. Room was very clean & tidy & plenty with plenty of space. We were all made to feel extremely welcome & nothing was to much trouble. Amazing holiday with lots to do v unexpected but pleasantly surprised so much so we r planning our next trip before we've even left!!!! Thanku so much for everything!",Date of stay: June 2016,Hotel la petite Morfo,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Lovely food in beautiful surroundings,We visited here on the 2nd night of our hols & it was so good we returned the following evening! The good was beautifully cooked & arrived looking v well presented & tasting equally as good. The staff were extremely polite & v helpful. My son is a v difficult eater but after receiving exactly what he had asked for he ate his entire meal! It is so peaceful sitting among the flowers & would highly recommend!,Date of visit: May 2016,Taverna Dionyssos,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Disgusting!!!!,"Any1 thinking of staying here should rethink!!! We only stayed 1 night before we flew, which was just as well as I couldn't have stomached anymore! The bathroom was rotten, inc pubic hairs round the toilet, rusted soap dish which kept falling off the wall, layers of dust behind the bedside tables & the food doesn't even warrant a mention-horrible!!! I know u get what u pay for & this was the cheapest airport travel solution for us from home but surely cleanliness isn't too much to ask for! There was a party of children in not sure how many but plenty of them, they were totally unsupervised & where allowed to just run riot around the hotel. We went out & returned to the hotel at 11pm & we're still dodging kids running around, no comments off the hotel staff what so Eva!",Date of stay: May 2016,Britannia Country House Hotel & Spa,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Beautiful food,"Had a meal here on a wet dismal Sunday but this helped cheer up the day! Quite local to us but somewhere Iv always said I want to visit & never have until today, I will 100% be back! Good home made meals with proper salad-no bagged rubbish! Staff v helpful & polite & v child friendly, added bonus. Can't wait to return & work my way thro the menu!",Date of stay: May 2016,Rusland Pool Hotel,1,"Haverthwaite, United Kingdom"
Perfect,"Perfectly situated hotel to visit Meadowhall shopping centre esp when arriving by train. Lovely clean room, beautiful bfast & attentive staff. Wish they had family rooms they're defo missing out not!!",Date of stay: October 2015,Travelodge Sheffield Meadowhall Hotel,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Divine!!!,"this was a return visit for me & defo wasn't disappointed! So gd the 1st nite we returned for the next night! Paella for the 1st night was delicious, plenty of seafood & presented nicely, I loved the way the waiter served it for us then came bak later to serve the 2nd half. On the 2nd visit I chose the El mundo menu which was prawn cocktail followed by steak then pancakes & ice cream all for 22€! I imagined the portions to be small because of the price of the individual prices on the menu but they were full size, cooked to perfection & once again served v nicely. We also had white wine sangria which was beautiful!",Date of visit: May 2015,Restaurante El Mundo,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Birthday treat,"After frequently visiting for ""dinner time cheap specials"" we decided on an eve visit for my sisters birthday & we weren't disapointed! Choosing more special options, tagliettelli with chicken & prawns & tagliettelli with prawns, mussels & salmon both around £10 we were very plzd with our choices! Really beautiful sauce, freshly cooked & plenty of it. Il defo be revisiting soon.",Date of visit: September 2014,Salvanas Restaurant,1,"Barrow-in-Furness, United Kingdom"
Stay away!!!!,"Absolutely dire! Even entering the building the receptionist seemed she would rather be anywhere else but. We went to our room which altho small for 2 people was adequate, the bathroom was clean enough but v tired. Plain white or rather dirty white bedding inc a quilt which barely touched both sides! 1 towel each. The carpet was rotten & needs a gd clean but obviously hadn't even been hoovered so 1st job was 2 pick up the biscuit, sweet paper & earring back up from under the bed! The food was basic 2 say the least but of v poor quality & sweets were the same each day. Staff in all areas seem 2b losing the will to live & act very matter of fact! V sad to see how a once lovely holiday venue has become in a short space of time since I was last here-I defo won't b back!!!!!",Date of stay: September 2014,Grand Metropole Hotel,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
Perfect!,"Fab hotel in brill location. Everything about this holiday was 100% perfect for me. Food was lovely with large selection, beautiful room which was always spotless. All the staff were v friendly. Submarine trip is a must. Highly rec holiday 10/10 thanku all v much for yr efforts!",Date of stay: January 2014,Coral Sea Holiday Resort & Aqua Park,1,"Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt"
