Cool experience! Caught some fish!,"This is an amazing way to spend a day in Milos. Kapetan Kyriakos, his very nice daughter and the rest of the crew will go out of their way to make sure you have a great time. They allow a limited number of people on the boat so you really feel included in planning the trip. Our party of four visited several cool beaches, ate fish soup prepared on the spot and of course did some rod fishing! Shoutout to Kapetan Kyriakos who is an amazing oldschool Greek guy and truly passionate about fishing. Lambros, USA/ Greece",Date of experience: July 2018,Milos Fishing Trip,5,"Milos, Greece"
