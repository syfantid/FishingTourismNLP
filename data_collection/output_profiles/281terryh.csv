Great food in a spectaclar setting,"Visited several times over the last two weeks. Lovely location in the orange grove, friendly and efficient service, well cooked and presented food and great variety in the menu. All in all we couldn’t fault it.",Date of visit: June 2018,Esperides,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Absolutely amazing day out!,"I don’t do excursions. They are normally over-expensive money spinners for resorts. However, I cannot commend Antonia and Michaelis enough for their amazing fishing trip. The experience is truly not to be missed. The kindness, the food and the fishing experience is more than you could ever expect.. Swimming off the boat whilst lunch is being cooked is sublime and you will make new friends and enjoy relaxation beyond belief.
Do it. You will not regret it.",Date of experience: June 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Excellent meal in Papagallos,"Nice little restaurant on the main street. Had veal steak and pasta ala genovese. Steak was perfectly cooked, pasta very tasty, very good value. Waiter was friendly and attentive. Ouzo to finish much appreciated! Would very much recommend this restaurant if you're in Antiparos.",Date of visit: May 2014,Papagallos,4,"Antiparos, Greece"
Excellent food and service,"Went for a meal for my wife's birthday. We had the tasting menu which was superb - each dish beautifully presented with a wide range of flavours.

Our waitress Rebecca was appropriately attentive, describing each course and ensuring we had everything we needed.",Date of visit: November 2013,Wharf House,4,"Gloucester, United Kingdom"
