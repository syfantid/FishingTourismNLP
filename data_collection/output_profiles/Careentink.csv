Villa papaz,"Lovely villa with some special features.... the pool area is great and lovely warm temperature. Great views and a fab hot tub. Very central location, great for getting around the island. House was very clean and having Laura on hand if we needed anything was great. The central courtyard was great for warmer evenings with lovely candles. Throughly enjoyed our family holiday.",Date of stay: February 2020,"Villa Papaz in Conil, spacious with stunning views",4,"Lanzarote, Spain"
50th,"What a find.... living locally I wanted a venue to host my 50th weekend celebrations. Tamara and team were amazing... I visited twice before confirming! I required a high spec interior for friends and family to stay from overseas and around the UK, whilst hosting a party on the Saturday for friends and family who live locally. A perfect sound proof venue that catered for all our needs.

Bedrooms are great with individual temperature control and all en-suite bathrooms with tv and sound systems in each room. Loved the detailing throughout the house which respects and highlights the industrial integrity of the building. Everything is finished to a very high standard and spotlessly clean.

The kitchen has everything you need and more.... double ovens, American fridge freezer, drinks fridge and all high spec crockery and glassware.

Tamara has an extensive list of caterers and events planners. A one stop shop to create a bespoke event and stay.",Date of stay: November 2019,"THE RAILWORKS 1 : 7 ENSUITE BEDS, TV ROOM, SLEEPS 35",4,"Brighton, United Kingdom"
Birthday fishing and boat trip,"What a wonderful experience with Giannis our skipper for the day. We all caught fish under Giannis guidance to much delight of young and old! Secluded bays for swimming and snorkelling... diving off the boat followed by a lovely lunch of our catch of the day. We highly recommend Giannis hospitality, humour, expertise and culinary skills.... what a top day thank you.",Date of experience: August 2019,Poseidon Fishing Trips,4,"Poros, Greece"

Oasis in the volcanic fields,"We loved our family holiday at Finca Malvasia. We stayed in the main house and had one of the best holidays ever. The house and surrounding grounds are wonderful, and the views amazing. We had so much space for all the family to hang out and read, paint, revise (15 year old) and eat and drink and laze in the sunshine and warmth, or snuggle up in the evening with the wood burning fire. Thank you to Richard and Tarnya for being flexible with our dates etc.... we will be back!",Date of stay: February 2019,Finca Malvasia,4,"Lanzarote, Spain"
