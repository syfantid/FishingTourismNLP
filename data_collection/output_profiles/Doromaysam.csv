First visit and won’t be the last,First time of trying Delicious in our 3 visits to the island but it’s definitely one we will return to. Lovely food in a very family friendly environment,Date of visit: August 2020,Delicious,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great evening - great food and stFf,"Another lovely evening at Katelios Taverna. Great setting, great food and atmosphere. The tables are well spaced out and so you feel totally safe in this environment",Date of visit: August 2020,Katelios Taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great that Persas’ has opened,Great that Persas’ has opened for the season. Great meal last night with us both opting for the Moussaka which was by far the best we’ve had whilst here and our son having the chicken Souvlaki. Such a pretty setting - was so pleased to see it was filling up by time we were leaving.,Date of visit: August 2020,Persas Taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Friday night - tasting menu,I have been meaning to try here for ages and with the closure of La Barbe it was time to give it a go. The food was excellent as was the wine pairing. The restaurant was full and had a great vibe but the staff still have time to stop and engage which was always what we loved about La Barbe. Wish it was nearer but can see this becoming our new go to place. If you like good food you can’t go wrong here!,Date of visit: January 2020,Chez Vous,1,"Warlingham, United Kingdom"
Why didn’t I try here sooner..,OMG I wish we had tried here sooner. The food here is exceptional. We stoped for a coffee at midday and liked how clean and fresh the place felt so returned for dinner and weren’t disappointed. My only regret is we didn’t stop before as there is more I want to try on the menu. The fresh egg starter and grilled Pulpo main were exceptional as was the belly pork . Please try here if you want something different - you won’t be disappointed. The view is great too!,Date of visit: April 2019,Sergio,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Good Friday - Good Food,"This was our 4th year of going to Casa Rafa on Good Friday and yet again we weren’t disappointed (we have been on other days too!!). I had prebooked as I know they get busy. We had a lovely table in the front corner and were very well looked after. Baby squids cooked to perfection, mussels and a house salad to start followed by the local Cherne and grilled prawns for our son. The Homemade deserts are fabulous. There is a reason we keep returning because the food is always superb. This year we got a treat as we were leaving which we are going to enjoy this evening - than you. We look forward to returning soon.",Date of visit: April 2019,Casa Rafa Restaurante de Mar,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
A little piece of Food Heaven,So we have been coming to Playa Blanca for past 10 years and we never tried the predecessor as it’s based in the harbour but the new look of Cocina Del Puerto and a recommendation from another couple made us try and let me just say we are already booked to go back. We ate from the Specials and struggled to choose as they all sounded good. The food was exceptional. Octopus carpaccio with seared scallops and beans with poached egg and foie gras were our starters of choice followed by local fish. The starters were the best thing we have had all holiday and the fish was cooked perfectly. I can’t wait to go back and try some of the other dishes I saw being served. If you love top quality ingredients prepared well and served with flair then this place will not disappoint.,Date of visit: April 2019,Cocina Del Puerto,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Tres Bon,I can’t praise this place enough. For no particular reason we hadn’t been for a while but after returning last month we elected to go again with friends and we weren’t disappointed. The fact the menu had changed since last month was an initial concern but not for long the only concern was what to choose as it all sounded good. We all chose well and all had different. The staff are lovely and made us feel so welcome. We should probably apologise as think we were last to leave but quite simply we didn’t want evening to end. Will be returning very soon.,Date of visit: April 2019,La Barbe,1,"Reigate, United Kingdom"
Ticked all the boxes for a family ski trip,This was our second trip to Levi. First time we came on a package and stayed at the Sokos Hotel and this time we booked everything ourselves. This was by far the better trip - it was so nice coming back and lighting the fire and having our own space. We had planned to eat out 50% of time but ended up eating in most of the time. We brought our streaming device so watched films in the evening as well as catching the Northern Lights. We will return to Levi and Levilehto.,Date of stay: February 2019,Levilehto Apartments,1,"Levi, Finland"
Too good to miss,"Tonight is our third visit to this lovely restaurant. Hussain is a great host - he steered us towards the Turkish wine which was not only lovely but extremely reasonable. If you like meat you won’t go wrong here - on our various visits we’ve had grilled kebabs, the Ocakbasi kebab which is more like a stew, the lamb shank and the chateaubriand - all have been amazing. When we return to Side, which we will, we will definitely return here.",Date of visit: October 2018,Side Ocakbasi Restaurant,1,"Side, Turkey"
New go to place,Three visits and fourth booked - this place doesn’t disappoint. Consistently hearty tasty food. Worth the drive for us as nowhere on our doorstop comes close. Friendly staff who make you feel welcome. Best recommendation I’ve had.,Date of visit: September 2018,Cucina Italiana,1,"Oxted, United Kingdom"
Superb - 10/10 for presentation and taste,"We didn’t visit Cozy last year - what a mistake! My husband was keen to try so reluctantly I agreed. Well he was right to push it as from the moment we sat down we knew we were in for a good evening - our waiter Andreas was lovely and happy to give suggestions. The food was superb - seared Tuna Nicoise, chicken with mozzarella and burger all were presented beautifully and tasted amazing. I was having my 50th birthday whilst on holiday and we had already planned where we were going but after visiting Cozy we changed plans and booked Cozy for the evening. The owners were happy to host and all the staff looked after us so well - the food was outstanding again - all of the above plus pork souvlaki (the best I’ve had) and calamari served whole. If you haven’t tried Cozy you should - it will certainly be on our list going forward.",Date of visit: August 2018,Cozy,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
So much more than fishing - fantastic day put,What a fantastic day we had with Efi and Dimitrios. From the moment you step on their boat you know from their warm welcome that you are in for a good day. The harbour turtle made an appearance before we set off as an added bonus. Once out the harbour we headed towards Poros whilst drinking coffee and homemade biscuits. Once stopped the nets are pulled in and you either watch or join in with the removal of the various small fish from the nets - the kids of all ages loved this! During all this Dimitrios and Efi are watching and guiding - ensuring what should go back to the sea dies - an Octopus was sent back once we’d all watched it move across the deck. Once the nets are in we head back towards Argostoli again you can just sit and watch the view or help with removing the bigger fish in the nets. Dimitrios knows just where to stop and we got to see a seal before various beach stops where kids of all ages can snorkel or jump off the boat and enjoy the crystal water. Even a spa treatment is thrown in with a stop at a bay where there is mineral rich clay that had us all covering ourselves and baking before a swim back to the boat to remove the clay and have a delightful lunch - Efi cooks up a storm of freshly caught fish and beautiful salads. A few more stops after lunch on the way back to Katelios harbour. Such an amazing day from start to finish and one we will definitely do again. In short amazing,Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Early dinner - superb,"An early dinner with dad as we passed through Waterford was a very nice surprise. He normally always goes for a hotel so was pleases when he suggested Sheehan’s. From the friendly welcome to the amazing food served on the Early Bird - fish cake, soup and pate followed by fish & chips, duck and pork - my only regret was I couldn’t eat all my pork because it tasted delicious - note to self no starter next time. Our son was sure he was having the chocolate brownie but that all changed when Oreo cheesecake was on offer! Shame we don’t live in Waterford as this would be a regular haunt but we will definitely make it our place if choice going forward.",Date of visit: July 2018,Sheehan's,1,"Waterford, Ireland"
Great choice for a family visit to Kerry,"My husband booked this site with his sister who was staying in one of the caravans. To say I was pleased when I arrived is an understatement - it was so clean and well kept. We were blessed with wonderful weather and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Lots of people stop for a couple of nights and move on but we stayed for a week (we have too bigger tent to move!) and a lovely stay it was. I don’t think the owners ever stopped as the place was always clean. Lovely hot powerful showers (€1), washing up facilities, fridge freezer, kettle, microwave and a dining room which if the weather hadn’t been so good would have been used. Some great beaches nearby kept the kids happy - plenty of space to play once back at the site. Can’t fault this place - you won’t be disappointed.",Date of stay: July 2018,Glenross Camping & Caravanning Park,1,"Glenbeigh, Ireland"
Very pleasant surpeise,"We were recommended this by a family we met on a trip and so thought we would give it a go and we were not disappointed. Salmon starter, slow cooked reindeer and burger. All superb.",Date of visit: December 2017,Narran,1,"Levi, Finland"
Good job we weren’t hungry,I really wanted to try here but night we went we weren’t overly hungry and it was a good job. We went for the meat fondue - the meat was superb quality but 5 thin slivers of beef and 3 of LG with a mixture of vegetables would not have filled us up if we had been hungry. I felt it was expensive for what we got.,Date of visit: December 2017,Sapuska,1,"Levi, Finland"
Dinner under the stars - superb,I booked dinner as we were staying for the night for my husbands 50th. We went for the 6 course menu and every course was a delight - book in look and taste. Matched many of the Michelin star restaurants we have visited. Yes it was expensive in relation to other (poor) meals in Levi but reasonable compared to tasting menus back home. A treat that matched the occasion.,Date of visit: December 2017,Restaurant Utsu,1,"Levi, Finland"
Stunning,We stayed for 1 night for my husbands 50th. The igloo is lovely and cosy. We booked dinner in the restaurant and were blown away by it. The only spoiler for us was our neighbours who either didn’t read the guestbook or didn’t understand English or Flemish and kept their bathroom and kitchen lights on all night. We got to see the northern lights but I have no doubt they would have been better with less light pollution! Breakfast was a bit frantic in that everything needed replacing but it was a lovely continental breakfast with very good quality ingredients. All in all 5 stars as our neighbours are t the hotels fault!,Date of stay: December 2017,Golden Crown Levi Igloos,1,"Levi, Finland"
Friendly and great foid,We walked past the first night on our way too and from dinner. Every table was taken and so we decided to give it a go after reading the reviews. We weren't disappointed - the food (and wine) was great. We had a takeaway one night and gyros on walk back from beach another - great place that well deserves it's great reviews - yum!,Date of visit: July 2017,Katelios Grill House,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Stunning,A day trip to Sami has to include Melissani Caves - well worth the queue. I was expecting it to be a tourist trap in terms of having to pay extra for this and that but no one price for all. Well worth a visit as nothing prepared me for how stunning they were.,Date of experience: July 2017,Melissani Cave,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Mussel Saganaki...,Loving mussels and having read reviews we had to give it a go. WOW we were not disappointed it was the best starter we had all holiday - delicious. We're advised to have Roast lamb over Village lamb which was slow cooked and tasted better than it looked - mixed souvlaki were perfect. If the chips were home made like everywhere else we ate I would give them a 5!,Date of visit: July 2017,Maria's Taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great find,"Other guests where we were staying recommended here so we gave it a go - ended up returning a number of times - a little oasis and perfect when you want a good meal with excellent food and friendly staff. We were initially worried with such a vast menu that nothing would be great but we were quickly prove. Wrong, Roast lamb, chicken lesvos, moussaka, fish pie, souvlaki all were perfect and our son loved the pizzas (and the family's children who invited him to play).",Date of visit: July 2017,Jerry's Elliniko,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best fish restaurant,When we are on holiday we love to eat fish so have visited a number of fish restaurants. The freshness and the perfectly cooked fish catapults this place into first place over others that we have visited (and loved). When we return to Katelios this will be our first stop. If you like fish then make sure you try this place.,Date of visit: July 2017,Captain Jerry's,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Breakfast and waffles,We lucked out on our first day choosing here as our sunbeds of choice. Our son loved the deckchair so much so that he sulked the one day we went elsewhere! Breakfast was amazing - healthy option was delicious. Our son loved the Waffles which were huge! Friendly staff and chilled music - perfect,Date of visit: July 2017,Alou Yialou Beach Bar,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Poor,Revisited here and it's hard to believe it's same restaurant as last year. Starters were poor virtually tasteless - mains were slightly better but considering we paid same as meal last night which was amazing we won't be back - shame,Date of visit: April 2017,Mamma Rossa,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
2nd tine this holiday and even better than 1st visit,Wow 1st time hubby and I had mixed meats and it was very good. Today we returned and hubby had young bull chop and I we t for mixed meats again. Food was amazing. It's our last night tomorrow and we think we will go back. 4 adults and a child (pizza not kids menu( less than 100 E-impressive - 5 stars,Date of visit: April 2017,Restaurante Grill Volcan de Timanfaya,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Good Friday lunch,After a lovely lunch during the week we booked to return on Good Friday for lunch and weren't disappointed by food or service. Love that we introduced my parents here and whilst we return home tomorrow I know they will return a few times over next 2 weeks. Worth the drive for excellent seafood and service,Date of visit: April 2017,Casa Rafa Restaurante de Mar,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Fabulous Breakfast,Stopped here whilst visiting family in Waterford - what a treat. Breakfast was lovely and when we asked about the tomato relish the guy was really helpful and told m where I could get it at the airport on our way home and recommended another place to get a great sandwich for the flight so not only did we have a marvellous breakfast we got a great smoked salmon sandwich at the airport and avoided Ryanair plastic food! Can't wait to return in May when they are catering for a family function as the food looks great. We are fussy but this place was excellent and will become our venue of choice when we are in Waterford.,Date of visit: February 2017,The Granary Cafe,1,"Waterford, Ireland"
Sunday lunch then back in less than a week for Saturday lunch - both fabulous,"I have been meaning to try here for years wish we had as the Sunday lunch was one of the best I have had in a pub. I like my beef pink and so many pubs cremate it but at 4pm on a Sunday I got to order how I wanted it and it was perfect - Cauliflower Cheese comes as part of the roast and it and the other vegetables were delicious. We were to impressed we returned yesterday for my Dad's birthday - this time Fish pie, Salmon, fish and chips and burgers were had and wall were perfect. I know we are going to become regulars.",Date of visit: March 2017,Skimmington Castle,1,"Reigate, United Kingdom"
Always a warm welcome,"Every time I visit I wonder why I don't go more often. Regardless of when you go you are always made to feel welcome and that your custom is welcome. I hope now the weather is getting better that I see queues as they so deserve the custom v other local places. Give here a try be it for breakfast, lunch or a coffee you wont be disappointed and you are sure of a warm welcome.",Date of visit: March 2017,Pistachios in the Park Redhill,1,"Redhill, United Kingdom"
Never Again,"From the minute I walked in the staff came across as rude or disinterested and that I was imposing on their quite time - perhaps we were! For reasons I'm not sure we were told to order our food at the bar which we did, paid, sat down and waited. What we got was very average food (the smallest portion of coleslaw I have ever seen as a side) the boy ordered nuggets off the kids menu, which he liked. When we finished we waited for our table to be cleared and to order deserts but they took so long we decided to leave but then I realised that I had paid for the boys ice cream, so I went in to ask for it. Again we waited and nothing. Finally we gave up and left. It would have been nicer, cheaper and quicker to have gone to their competitor under the golden arches across the road",Date of visit: July 2016,Frankie & Benny's,1,"Crawley, United Kingdom"
Where the locals go,We walked past this during the day when it was closed and as it was off the beaten track we decided to go back one evening. Food was amazing - only issue was very few tables to eat at so hard to go in a group. Will return to good to miss,Date of visit: April 2016,El Peregrino,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Popular but there is better,Cant fault the food it was nice but didn't think it was as good as some reviews or other places that we went to whilst we were in Playa Blanca.,Date of visit: April 2016,Restaurante Isla Bonita,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
lovely view and away from the hussle an bussle,sat above the main restaurant drag. We stopped for a drink and tapas and were impressed with what we had and the food going to other tables - one to try properly next time.,Date of visit: April 2016,La Cuadra,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Superb!,We had been recommended to try but when we arrived they looked full. The manager made us up a table and we were so pleased he did as the food was amazing. We opted for Tapas and every dish was great but the crispy Octopus was amazing. We went back on our last night and went for tapas starters and then main courses - the local fish and Tuna was superb - great place cant wait to return.,Date of visit: April 2016,La Katedral,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Took a lucky punt that paid off,Decided to give La Fiaba a try after reading many a review - weren't disappointed - very relaxed restaurant serving good home cooked Mediterranean food. We will be back for a second round,Date of visit: December 2015,La Fiaba del Mediterraneo,1,"Caterham, United Kingdom"
good tour,"While the tour was excellent and very informative and the tasting was great.
The sour taste was, we discovered even with the discount voucher that the price of the XO in the concession was more expensive than the local supermarkets by quite a bit.",Date of experience: July 2015,Remy Martin,1,"Cognac, France"
What do you expect for the price,Yes it was basic but it was clean and for a late arrival it did what it said on the can. Stumbled over this chain in Toulouse when we missed our flight and am happy with the basic cheap stop overs they provide. Booked Tours when we planned our trip and expected to be there about 6pm - we rang to say we were running late and needed to know how to get in - not a problem the guy waited for us - above and beyond in my book.,Date of stay: July 2015,Fasthotel Tours Sud,1,"Chambray-Les-Tours, France"
At last somewhere to dine when visiting family,"I'd been told by a work colleague this place was good and a question to my cousin over lunch confirmed it was worth a try. So glad we did fantastic steak, well cooked chips and solid wine selection made This a great impromptu visit. The return will be planned with starter and pud included the Jamon and manchenga platter plus a glass of chilled sherry conjures up memories of Spain. Can't wait to return.",Date of visit: March 2015,Two Bulls Steakhouse,1,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom"
