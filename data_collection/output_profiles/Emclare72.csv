Our 3rd visit and won’t be our last...one of our favourite holiday destinations ...,"This was our third (and we very much hope not our last) visit to these wonderful apartments. As always we were given the warmest of welcomes from the owners and the wonderful selection of provisions that awaited us in our favourite room (Attic Room number 1). As serviced a apartment it is great to have the daily housekeeping and the beds made and the option to eat out or prepare food for yourselves. With sun loungers on the terrace and direct access to the sea we rarely feel the need to leave!! Other than to have a short (level) stroll into the town to visit the bakery, supermarket or the numerous wonderful restaurants and shops. Thank you Stravroula and Alexis for another wonderful holiday. We never usually go back to the same place twice, but have made an exception to this rule with your apartments, as you have a special place in our hearts.",Date of stay: August 2019,Odysseas Waterfront Apartments,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
An unexpected treasure - we’ll definitely be back,"Looking for 1 nights accommodation in the area for a family of 3, we booked a one nights stay at The Four Horseshoes. What a find!! Every single member of staff was genuinely friendly and attentive and made us feel very welcome. A wonderful pub with a great atmosphere and food. Our room was great - and nice and spacious for a family of three. And the cooked breakfast in the morning was amazing!! We will definitely come back. Thank you to all the staff for making us feel so welcome.",Date of visit: November 2019,The Four Horseshoes,1,"Eye, United Kingdom"
"Fantastic, unique experience and excellent food!","Thank you Captain Michalis, Antonia, and Mustafa for a brilliant day.
It was wonderful to join your boat to experience and appreciate just what goes into catching the fish that we eat.
A brilliant day out meeting lovely people on board. There was plenty of opportunities to enjoy the scenery and coastline, and to swim and snorkel in a secluded bay before enjoying an amazing lunch prepared from the catch - thank you again - lovely photos and memories from a great day out!",Date of experience: August 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Terrible, transfer service do not use for holiday parking","Wish I'd read the reviews on here and on holidaywatchdog.com before booking our overnight stay with holiday parking & transfers - as I definitely would not have booked this establishment.

On arrival we were horrified by the carpark. Cars were abandoned anywhere. Double and treble parked making it impossible for us to find a space. We were directed through a narrow pathway and told to leave our car across other cars. We actually feared for the safety of our car while we were away but at 8pm it was too late in the day to cancel and check-in elsewhere.
We checked in (had booked a treble room) and then had to haul our luggage back across the carpark again to a different accommodation block. The room, was actually a double which had had the wardrobe moved and a small camp bed added. Room was clean but far too hot to sleep. There was no air conditioning and we couldn't open the window as we were on the ground floor and there was no way of securing the side opening window to prevent any intruder access from outside.
The digital TV didn't receive a signal so we couldn't watch TV and the shower water was far too hot with no way of adjusting it to make it colder so we couldn't let our son shower for fear of him being scalded (very frustrating).
We had an early flight so we had booked our transfer for 3.30am. The driver was ready and waiting and the transfer was good. On return however we had a very different experience.
Having arrived back at Gatwick I called hotel (as instructed) once we were at bus stop 9 at Gatwick South. I was told by receptionist she would contact the driver. So we waited. We waited for more than 35mins and despite lots of other hotel shuttles and transfer buses, none were for the Cambridge Hotel (we asked each one to check!). I called hotel and this time a different receptionist answered and she said that the driver had been and we'd missed it!! I told her she was wrong, as we had been stood at the bus stop and no one from Cambridge Hotel had been. She told me I was wrong! I asked her are you calling me a liar - I can assure you your driver has not been while we've been stood here and I would like to know how much longer we have to wait?!! She told me he would be there in 7 mins!
Driver arrived (about 10mins later) and he asked me how many of us - I told him x3. He then asked another group who were x6 and he started loading their luggage. Once they'd got in I asked if we should get in and he told me there was only x2 seats left!!! I told him there were 3 of us and that we had been waiting there longer than the other people and we should be transferred first, he shrugged his shoulders and said it wasn't his problem!!! I called the hotel and explained to yet another receptionist the problem and she said to tell the driver to make the other people get out - I told her I'd tried so asked her to tell him and handed the driver my phone.
He suggested we get in the vehicle and I have my 9yr old son on my lap!! I told him that was illegal and I was not risking my own or my sons safety so he shrugged his shoulders. We ended up having to wait over an hour to get back to the hotel to retrieve our car. The hotel receptionist then greeted us by saying ""where have you been, we've been waiting ages for you!!!!!!!!""

Shower of an establishment. Appalling customer service with no interest in rectifying problems. I asked for a refund and was told I would have to speak to the manager. When I asked to speak to the manager I was told he'd gone out!! I guess he was the man who scuttled into the back room as I entered reception!!!!
We will never use this ""hotel"" again. And would advise you to book elsewhere.",Date of stay: August 2016,Gatwick Cambridge Hotel,1,"Horley, United Kingdom"
Fantastic beach,"This is our favourite beach when visiting North Devon, just be warned the car parking fee is charged for the day, so you will want to make a day of it (£5 for the day or £3 after 2pm).
Worth going for the day though, and recommend hiring a beach hut which has deck chairs and windbreaks included.
There are loos and catering facilities next to the car park.",Date of experience: April 2016,Saunton Sands Beach,1,"Saunton, United Kingdom"
"Excellent hotel, located on one of the best beaches in Jersey with exceptionally helpful and friendly staff.","My husband and I recently enjoyed a 2 night, mid-week break at L'Horizon with our 5 year old son. We booked through BA, which gave us a complimentry upgrade to a sea-view, executive double room - which gave us stunning views directly over St Brelades Bay.
I would definately recommend booking a sea-view room - waking up to that view is a must!
I'd have no hesitation in recommending the hotel. We found all of the staff to be very friendly and helpful - each one going 'above and beyond' to assist and where possible resolve any issues (in our case we struggled to gain Internet access - and despite a router being brought to our room we still found it to be limited to 1 device at a time and in the end gave up trying - so there's still some work to be done there for Hand Picked Hotels)
The room came with an excellent tea tray with a plentiful supply of tea/coffee/ hot chocolate and shortbread, a good kettle, lovely big mugs and even a tea pot! It was much appreciated.

Housekeeping was excellent and very attentive - regularly replacing used mugs with clean ones and replenishing used supplies. Lovely little touches made us feel totally looked after and included things like the bed being turned down each evening and a bottle of water placed on the bedside tables etc.

My only gripe would be that our room (276), had an interconnecting door with the room next door. Despite this being locked, we could hear absolutely everything from the other rooms occupants - at one point I thought the husband was taking a bath in our bathroom! This meant we were very conscious of any noise we were making which is particularly tricky with a 5 year old boy in the room! I would suggest that the hotel should where possible avoid putting families with young children next to other occupants (I appreciate that might not be possible during high season).

The breakfasts were delicious with an excellent choice and selection available from a hot and cold buffet.
Our son enjoyed use of the pool (which was a few degrees too cold for my liking), so I kept to the Jacuzzi instead!)
Despite being February the sun shone and although the windchill meant we were subjected to freezing temperatures, we really enjoyed our morning walks on the vast expanse of beach and exploring the rock pools. We appreciated returning to the sunny indoor terrace at the Hotel where we would sit and defrost while enjoying the view of the beach.
We hired a car for the duration of our stay and used it to explore the island and see some more of Jerseys stunning beaches. We would love to return during the summer and would definitely return to L'Horizon, which was in our opinion 'the best hotel on the island'.

PS - Can I say a big thank you to the hotel for returning my sons mattress protector that I forgot to remove before we left! Thank you so much.",Date of stay: February 2013,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,1,"Jersey, United Kingdom"
