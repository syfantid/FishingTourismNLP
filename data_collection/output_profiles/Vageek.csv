An amazing experience!,"Do not leave the area without this experience! You can hop the boat from either Milos or Kimolos. Captain Nikos and his wife are the most wonderful couple to take you to a day-long journey to Polyegos and the surrounding area. The day starts with collecting the fish from the bottom of the sea - the very fish you are going to have for lunch later on!

This is a difficult thing to organize; you need an excellent captain, an excellent cook and excellent and welcoming service. The couple offers all of the above with abundance, making the trip a memorable and must-have experience including fishing, swimming in the most gorgeous beaches in Polyegos, dining and sightseeing (with pirate story/telling!)

Great to have this in your list!",Date of experience: August 2019,Milos Fishing Experience,1,"Milos, Greece"
Outstanding quality,"Thea Thalassa is a great launchpad to enjoy the beautiful island of Tinos. Excellent price-to-quality ratio, as the aesthetics, quality, hospitality and services are exceptional.

The view is one of the best across the island, and the very hospitable owners will make you feel like you're at home.

Highly recommended!",Date of stay: July 2017,Thea Thalassa Studios,1,"Tinos, Greece"
Terrible managers,"Let's get some things straight right off the bat: this is, hands down, the best beach in Kithira - from a landscape perspective. Crystal-clear waters, great sand.

What's super-bad though, is the fact that an ignorant couple somehow landed the management of the beach, and this is bad. Their knowledge on how to secure a good customer experience is abysmal, and so they try with cheap tricks (e.g. an offering of a minuscule piece of bread, or cleaning the sunbeds with Dettol before you sit) to compensate, always with the opposite effect.

Service is incredibly slow (as they try to maximize profit by having only a poor teenager walking up and down, trying to serve 50+ umbrellas).

This is a clear example in why people should stick with what they know (being a museum curator for instance) and leave customer experience to people who actually want and can do it.

Avoid, unfortunately.",Date of experience: August 2017,Melidoni Beach,1,"Kythira, Greece"
Απατεώνες,"Έχω την εντύπωση οτι το POS ειναι υποχρεωτικό πλέον. Εκτός απο κάποιους οι οποίοι, σε πείσμα των αναγκών του κόσμου αλλά και του νόμου, αποφασίζουν να κάνουν το δικό τους.

Τα καλυτερα ποτά στη Χώρα ειναι 10 μέτρα πιο κάτω, και αυτό φαίνεται και απο τον κόσμο.

Ντροπή.",Date of experience: August 2017,Choraki,1,"Kythira, Greece"
Unprofessional and inhospitable,"The price is crazy high. The rooms are very small and not advertised as such. The bathroom is old, rusty and squeeky, breakfast and service is simply non-existent. Beds are hard, parking can be a challenge. Besides trying to cheat and conveniently 'forget to mention' aspects, this hotel should radically lower it's price to a more reasonable ~80 euros rather than double that.",Date of stay: July 2016,Adamantia Hotel,1,"Paxos, Greece"
Zero empathy,"While Ramada Plaza is one of the best known, the service is way below par.

While the staff try to respond, the hotel's processes are set up poorly - and certainly not rendering a service for the price the hotel asks for.

Every time something was needed (room
service? Taxi call? Extra stay? Cleaning? Check out?) they failed miserably to satisfy, even being misaligned with what thy promised in terms of services and charge.

Overall, a bad experience. There are many hotels in town who actually WANT their guests to have a nice time.

The Ramada is not one of them.",Date of stay: October 2015,Hyperion Hotel Basel,1,"Basel, Switzerland"
Beautiful & relaxing,"We discovered Monopati before setting out for a long weekend in Monemvasia. Had good reviews so we contacted the managers to book us a room. The hotel is situated inside the picturesque Castle of Monemvasia, so that is already a major advantage. The spacious two-leveled room was fantastic, nicely decorated and providing everything we needed for our stay there. It sleeps 4-5 people with relative ease, having 2 separate bedrooms, a kitchen, a large living room with fireplace, central heating, air conditioning etc. What was amazing though was the patio overlooking Monemvasia and the sea, allowing you to relax and tan while enjoying music or reading a book. The service was very good, the room was very clean and the hotel managers are as helpful as they come! I would recommend this place and, obviously, I would stay here again!",Date of stay: March 2013,Monopati Residence,1,"Monemvasia, Greece"
"Truly Parisian, and that has it's pros & cons","Paris is wonderful, and getting around is easy using the Metro. However, choosing your hotel location can be paramount if you want to be at the very center of everything. This was the main reason we chose Le Pradey: location, location, location. Situated near Place Concorde, in Paris' 1st Arrondissement, this is a small, very parisian and charming hotel which you can use as base for your explorations. Don't be mind-bongled by its size; almost all hotels in paris are small - and the rooms too. Le Pradey features a wonderful little mezzanine (dubbed 'Honesty Bar') where you can have Nespresso and tea for free, and anything else you consume, it's up to you to tell the reception when you check-out (hence, 'Honesty'). The rooms are very clean and the bed is amazing. Bathrooms are clean and adequately large. To be honest, you probably don't need anything bigger. In terms of price, it's rather on the steep side, considering what you get, but this is Paris. Recommended, I would stay here again!",Date of stay: December 2012,Hôtel Le Pradey,1,"Paris, France"
Not at par with other Hiltons,"Good location, however rooms are small and a bit on the old side...not really recommended. The overall interior is nice however when it comes to rooms, it's one of the worst hotels bearing the Hilton badge.",Date of stay: September 2012,Hilton Prague,1,"Prague, Czech Republic"
A fantastic hotel,"First of all, let me warn you: DO NOT GET MISLED by low-ranking reviews, these are probably before a major renovation some two years back.

So, on to the review: we were here on September '12 on our honeymoon. We had booked a beach front villa with pool, however pon our arrival we were bumped up to a senior beach front villa with pool, the hotel's best room available.

Typically, beach front villas consist of two-story little 'huts', with the regular one on the sand level and the senior one on top of the regular one, each with its own pool and direct access to the beach. The senior which accommodated us was simply put the best room we've ever been to, and we are very frequent travelers, having stayed at top hotels around the globe.

The hotels 6 restaurants are all amazing with delicious food that matches every taste, from Italian to Thai. Water sports are free for guests, and the Clarins Spa is a delight. The hotel is very modern and luxurious, while the staff, in all our interactions was very friendy and courteous. Some issues with WiFi access were easy to get by with by the sheer enjoyment the hotel offered us.

On the downside, if you're visiting this hotel, make sure you go for the beach front villas, because the garden-looking ones just take away some of the atmosphere Mauritius has to offer.

Overall, a recommended choice, trust me, you'll love it,",Date of stay: September 2012,Trou Aux Biches Beachcomber Golf Resort & Spa,1,Mauritius
Amazing,"Amazing location, amazing view, amazing ambience. A visit to Ortakoy made worthwhile. Don't miss",,The House Cafe Ortakoy,1,"Istanbul, Turkey"
Amazing amazing AMAZING!,"Every time I visit Istanbul, I visit 360. One of the most atmospheric places in the city, with perfect view, amazing food and fantastic cocktails. Truly blissful!",,360 Istanbul,1,"Istanbul, Turkey"
A pleasant stay,"Nicely located and carrying the Hilton brand name - so you immediately know what to expect at a minimum. The staff is friendly and courteous, often getting out of their way to assist. We had accidentally booked twin bedroom and after asking for a king-sized bed room, we were immediately upgraded. The terrace is nice to have a smoke or enjoy a cocktail, and the overall experience was very positive. Good price-to-quality ratio. A thumbs-up to reception staff (thanks Selim!)",Date of stay: June 2012,DoubleTree by Hilton Istanbul Old Town,1,"Istanbul, Turkey"
OK for business,"One of the plus's is the proximity to Vienna's airport. Clean, tidy, and sauna not bad either. The staff is a bit slow but a decent choice if you have to spend the night at the airport",Date of stay: June 2012,NH Vienna Airport Conference Center,1,"Vienna, Austria"
Fantastic,"I visit The Met frequently, and mostly for business purposes. The decoration is what first strikes you - it's breathtaking! The staff is very professional and courteous, and the food is excellent! The Met's ""SkyBar"" offers a magnificent view of the city and there are A LOT to do, including massage, spa, gym, pool etc - all top-notch. If you're visiting Thessaloniki, steer clear of everything else!",Date of stay: June 2012,The Met Hotel,1,"Thessaloniki, Greece"
5 stars? Check again?..,"First of all, the place is magnificent. The natural beauty of the region is unparalleled, with Porto Karras hotel dominating the place.

However, for a 5-star price, you don't get the treatment you are supposed to. The whole place shows its age, with rooms being kind of smelly at times. The staff is not optimized, certainly not with the response you should get for your money. We checked out at 9 o clock in the morning with a flight to catch, and there was a single employee checking out 60+ people. The queue was at least 30 meters long!!! Unacceptable for the tier...

The whole place needs a drastic revamp, so people forking out 400+ euros per night get what they're supposed to. Pity...",Date of stay: May 2012,Porto Carras - Sithonia,1,"Neos Marmaras, Greece"
A fine hotel for business workshops,We frequently visit Semiramis to hold off-site meetings and workshops. The rooms are excellent and the food is very good as well!,Date of stay: May 2012,Semiramis,1,"Kifissia, Greece"
Fantastic,"What a funky little place to have a lunch, waiting for your feet to come back online from the endless walks in Rome!

The mozzarella selection is endless and the pizza is quite nice too!

Take my word and stop by whenever you can!",,Obicà Mozzarella Bar - Parlamento,1,"Rome, Italy"
Best caffé in Rome,"Have a cappuccino or two, and don't forget to take some fresh brew home with you!",,Sant Eustachio il Caffè,1,"Rome, Italy"
Nice find,"Just bumped on it, this cozy little pizzeria is the perfect way to rest a bit and enjoy a fine pizza before continuing on strolling Rome.

We had spaghetti carbonara (very nice) and shared a pizza bresaola & rocket (very nice also)

Service could be a bit warmer, but I would recommend for lunch nevertheless",,Il Corallo,1,"Rome, Italy"
Again and again,"What a fantastic stay! We found this using tripadviasor.com and the reviews caught our attention..

The superior double room was huge, and was exactly as expected. The staff was very nice and helpful, booking us the restaurants of our choice every night and personally handing us notes for 'superior service' (they knew every owner!)

The location is superb and when we visit Rome again, we'll stay here for sure",Date of stay: April 2012,Hotel Majestic Roma,1,"Rome, Italy"
Majestic,"First of all, we overslept and missed our reservation; we called and we were immediately seated half an hour later. The staff is very courteous and helpful.

I had the carbonara with black truffle while my friend had the fish tartare. When the plates arrived, they also had a smaller plate with my carbonara for my friend 'because she shouldn't miss how good it is' - its more than good!

Then we had the meat tartare (exquisite) and the pasta amatriciana (fantastic)

Overall, we didn't want to leave the place (very cozy and designy) and when we visit Rome again, we'll be here again!",,Antico Arco,1,"Rome, Italy"
The best in Amorgos,"Amorgos is a relatively small island. It draws its charm from peaceful villages and calm venues. This also means there are not that many places you could choose to stay and enjoy the room at the same time. Emprostiada, however, is another story. It's probably the best, if not the only truly beautiful hotel in Amorgos. Aesthetically beautiful, rooms are adequate in size, daily cleaned and very, VERY hospitable. Emprostiada's location is also one of its strong suits; situated just 1 minute walking time from the center of the beautiful Chora of Amorgos, it could not be better. We've stayed more than 6 times here, and if we can't get a room here we don't even bother to visit the island. Strongly recommended, but book early.",Date of stay: August 2011,Emprostiada Traditional Guest House,1,"Amorgos, Greece"
I would stay here again,"Spent Christmas here; Soho Grand has a unique 'NewYorkish' aura around it, room size included. The staff is very professional and friendly, keeping you company even when you go outside for a smoke (thanks, Jose!). I would recommend it to anyone who can value location & feel, versus name and brag rights. A very good launch-pad to Big Apple.",Date of stay: December 2011,Soho Grand Hotel,1,"New York City, New York"
Avoid at all costs!,"Very touristic. Can't really combine sushi with dolma and Brazilian beef, sorry.",,Churrascaria Plataforma,1,"New York City, New York"
