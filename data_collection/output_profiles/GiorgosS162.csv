A day in paradise,"What an amazing experience! Frosso and Nikos are very welcoming and they treated us like family. They will take you to amazing places around polyaigos and cook the freshest fish for you. The food is cooked in the traditional Greek fishermen style from Ms. Frosso herself!

Polyaigos has some of the most amazing waters we've ever seen. A paradise of the sea.

Don't miss this trip if you are staying in Milos or Kimolos!

Thank you for everything! Joanna and George.",Date of experience: August 2019,Milos Fishing Experience,5,"Milos, Greece"
