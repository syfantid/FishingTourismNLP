Fair to middling!,"We visited on a wet Saturday so unsurprisingly it was very busy. We were told that there would be nothing available but luckily we spotted a couple just finishing, so after a discrete hover by the bar we got a table. We decided to keep things simple and ordered a 'Fleece Burger' and 'Inferno' Pizza to share. The pizza was nice and spicy with a good crispy base, but the burger was disappointing. When you pay £14 for a burger I think its reasonable to expect a decent standard of ingredient. The patty was a very fine grind, over-seasoned, more akin to a frozen supermarket burger than anything made in the kitchen. The staff were friendly enough and the atmosphere was pleasant but overall, we got the impression that the place owed a lot to its good location and a captive audience rather than a desire to shine on the food front. I am sure we will visit again, but will probably stick to the liquid refreshments!",Date of visit: September 2019,The Golden Fleece,4,"Wells-next-the-Sea, United Kingdom"
Exceeded expectations!,"Four of us visited last night - drawn to ‘The Artichoke’ by the Pauliner beer which we have previously enjoyed in Munich. After seeing a few interesting looking dishes being carried through from the kitchen we decided to give the food a try. We ordered both of the special ‘big bowl’ dishes and a selection from the menu to share. Wow...the food was absolutely delicious! The dishes came out a couple at a time as they were freshly prepared by the kitchen and without exception they were all well presented and bursting with flavour! The staff were friendly and the gentleman who served us helpful and efficient. The whole experience exceeded our expectations on every level. This place is a real hidden gem, but no doubt won’t be for long. We will certainly be visiting again very soon. Well done guys",Date of experience: September 2019,The Artichoke,4,"Norwich, United Kingdom"
Exceeded expectations!,"My son and I decided to try a fishing trip and it turned out to be the highlight of our holiday!
When we arrived at the harbour, we were welcomed onboard the boat by the owners Dimitrios and Efthimia who gave us hot coffee and some lovely homemade biscuits.
The boat was well appointed and obviously proudly maintained. There was plenty of room for the twelve guests onboard and the main deck was covered to give protection from the sun. There was a clean WC, a freshwater shower hose and wash taps for guest use.
We left the harbour and motored out to the first nets which had been set out the night before. As they were brought up we saw a huge variety of fish species of all sizes, shapes and colours We were encouraged to help remove them from the nets which was great fun - although not as easy as they made it look! By the time we collected the second net we had a bumper catch of wonderful fresh fish.
Efi selected the best from our catch and set about cooking them. The larger fish were seasoned with salt and spicy wild oregano and griddled whole. The smaller fish were dusted with seasoned flower and fried in olive oil. She went on to make a fresh potato salad and Dimitrios made a salad of tomato, cucumber, sweet pepper and red onion - all home grown. Two magnums of homemade wine were taken off ice and we set about what I can only describe as a feast of some of the most delicious fish I have ever tasted!!
After lunch Dimitrios took us to a secluded swim spot and we had a relax before heading back to the harbour, all of us full and content :-)
If you are at all interested in fishing and good food, I can’t recommend this experience highly enough. Dimitrios and Efi were perfect hosts exceeding our expectations on every level !!",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Great food, service and atmosphere.","I visited on a Friday evening as part of a large group, We were looking for a good standard of cuisine, without it being too formal and 'The Last' turned out to be the perfect choice! Despite the place being packed we still received excellent and service from some lovely staff. We ordered from the A la Cart menu and were all very pleased with what we were given. I ordered the Ribeye for my main which was delicious and cooked a perfectly to my liking. The sides were very tasty and we had several bottles of fantastic red wine to wash it all down! I understand that this long standing restaurant has recently been acquired by a group of local entrepreneurs and they have certainly injected a big shot of enthusiasm into the place as it was really buzzing! I will certainly be visiting 'The Last' again in the very near future!!",Date of visit: May 2019,The Last Wine Bar,4,"Norwich, United Kingdom"
