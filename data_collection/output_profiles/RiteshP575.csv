Amazing service and food,We happen to stumble across this place and what a find. There were 24 of us plus two dogs and luckily we had entire upstairs floor to ourselves. A wide range of options on the menu with fish and chips being the favourite amongst our group. Overall food was tasty and decent portions. But we really loved the service - nothing was too much trouble and they all served with a smile despite having to carry the drinks and food upstairs to us. Our dogs were well looked after with water and treats. Would highly recommend.,Date of visit: August 2020,The Bank Bar & Kitchen,4,"Brecon, United Kingdom"
Awesome pub with great food and dog friendly,We were a family of seven + puppy visiting on a Friday afternoon. The staff were amazing. Food was fantastic - we had the lamb and fish options - great portions and tasty. Service was quick and they came around plenty of times to check we were ok. We were worried about the puppy but they all welcomed him with open arms providing water bowl and treats! Overall we would thoroughly recommend this quaint little pub. Keep up the great work!,Date of visit: January 2020,The Sun,4,"Carshalton, United Kingdom"
Friendly pub with good food,We really a lovely lunch at the Sailors pub following a nice coastal walk. Friendly service and nice outdoor seating with views.,Date of visit: October 2019,The Old Sailors,4,"Dinas Cross, United Kingdom"
Definitely worth doing,As per the reviews this is a really enjoyable walk and great views. Some steep steps that could be muddy if has been raining but overall OK to walk.,Date of experience: October 2019,Dinas Head (Dinas Island),4,"Dinas Cross, United Kingdom"
Simply beautiful,"We are so pleased that we had an opportunity to stay at this amazing property. We had to ground floor cottage which had three bedrooms, spacious lounge and modern well equipped kitchen. Simply beautiful. A unique location and that has been artfully upgraded to a high spec. Kevin, the owner, was super helpful and provided all the information we needed to make our stay as as smooth as possible. We were blessed with gorgeous weather all week allowing us to explore the area by foot with plenty of gorgeous trekking opportunities around the area.",Date of stay: July 2019,THE BOATHOUSES - TIDES REACH BOATHOUSE - SPECTACULARLY RENOVATED BOOK 2020 -2022,4,"Llanbedrog, United Kingdom"
Amazing,Amazing from start to end. We were a family of four on a Thursday evening. The staff were very polite and did not rush us at all throughout our meal. The starters were a good size and mains were delicious. Good selection of wines and we all enjoyed our deserts. We would highly recommend this restaurant.,Date of stay: July 2019,Tremfan Hall,4,"Llanbedrog, United Kingdom"
Amazing,"Highly recommended. Our hosts Jim and Sally were amazing, fun, knowledgeable, entertaining and superb hospitality. We were a small group so it felt more cosy. Market tour was an eye opener and certainly somewhere we wouldn’t have explored on our own so recommend to those who want to be adventurous. We are going to keep in touch and send pics of our attempt to cook those lovely dishes on our own. All the best Jim and Sally from Ritesh, Darshana, Rahil and Savan!",Date of experience: April 2019,"Kata Thai Cooking Class @ Phuket, Thailand",4,"Phuket, Thailand"
Must do when in the area,Our two boys aged 11 and 13 absolutely loved this. It’s not just straightforward shooting and archery. The owners have built in games and challenges that makes the experience different and you build your skills as each games on. Lots of interesting facts shared with the boys that makes you appreciate the skills required. We would definitely recommend. Thanks again guys and perhaps see you next year.,Date of experience: February 2019,The Cotswold Range,4,"Somerford Keynes, United Kingdom"
Great location and comfortable stay,The apartment is located in a lovely part of Naples called Vomero. We had a double room for grandparents and family room for 2 adults and 2 children which consisted of a double and twin room each with en-suite bathrooms. Apartments are well decorated and the double room had a lovely balcony facing the road. Parking is a challenge if you have a big car (7 or 9 seater). Alessandro was in touch with us at all times and to greet us. Also provided recommendations and advice as needed. The breakfast bar area was neatly decorated with plenty of food options. We would recommend this apartment in particular for its great location.,Date of stay: November 2018,Chez Anna,4,"Naples, Italy"
Must do when in Milos!,"If you want to experience fishing whilst in Milos then we would highly recommend this family run, laid back fishing experience. We were met by Tina and her dad at the beginning of the day. They took us to picturesque coves as we made our way to Kleftiko bay. We stopped to swim in the gorgeous clear Aegean sea, around fascinating caves. A continental breakfast of toast, croissants and delicious cakes were served with a choice of tea/coffee. Our two boys explored the sea with masks provided before spending the afternoon fishing catching eldarado's. The boys were able to help clean the fish and Tina prepared an amazing lunch of fresh fish soup, grilled barracuda and greek salads with bread. We were provided beers, wine, ouzo, soft drinks and water throughout the day. In summary we would highly recommend.",Date of experience: August 2018,Milos Fishing Trip,4,"Milos, Greece"
"Clean, convenient and spacious","The accommodation was clean and spacious. There were many quirky and unique features of the property which gave it a lot of character such as door handles, lamps, stone designs etc. It is well laid out and within walking distance into town. The kitchen was basic. Just the one downside was lack of hot water and limited wifi in one of the rooms otherwise we'd rate this 5 stars. The view was amazing. We would like to mention Fay who was particularly helpful through the booking process and on arrival. She helped to organise fishing trip and recommended beaches and restaurants which were all excellent. We would definitely recommend staying here if you are planning on visiting Milos.",Date of stay: August 2018,Thalassitra Village Hotel,4,"Milos, Greece"
Quality hotel,"For a holiday inn express this was a very good hotel. We stayed one night but the room was comfortable, plenty of parking and the pub next door was great for food. Best part for us was the staff who were extra friendly and responsive. Would definitely recommend.",Date of stay: July 2018,Holiday Inn Express Gloucester - South,4,"Quedgeley, United Kingdom"
Bespoke B and B,"We only stayed one night but the service was impeccable. Getting to know Alasdair and Deirdre wad part of the experience and they make it their job to know about you and ensure that you get the best out of local area. We loved their home, gardens and hospitality. As per previous reviews car needed but Google maps took us straight there. North Kessock Hotel for dinner was very nice. Would definitely recommend.

Alasdair - thank you for your recommendation to visit Aviemore - you were spot on and we had a great day out.",Date of stay: July 2018,Old Drynie House,4,"North Kessock, United Kingdom"
A fun filled day out,"Can’t really fault it. Lots of climbing, games, activities and walking paths. Staff were interactive, helpful and plenty of them. Yes it can get hectic if busy but there is plenty of options. The food options could be improved which is why i didn’t give it five stars although I think many bring their own. Parking is free and plenty of it. We’ll sign posted. Would definitely recommend.",Date of experience: August 2018,BeWILDerwood,4,"Hoveton, United Kingdom"
Great experience!,"Easy to find, amazing views and a decent cafe/restaurant at the top. We were fortunate to go when it was blue skies and warm but I can imagine it being cooler and windy so pack a light jumper. Watching the BMX riders and filling our water bottles from the natural streams was great fun!",Date of experience: July 2018,Nevis Range Mountain Experience,4,"Torlundy, United Kingdom"
Perfect for what we wanted,"We are a family of four with kids aged 12 and 10. We chose the hotel for its location and it didn’t fail us. As per the reviews the hotel from the outside can be off putting but inside is clean and well set out. The proximity to restaurants,
MTR and ferry ports makes this an ideal location to visit Hong Kong. Our family room consists of a sofa, two queen beds and a reasonable sized bathroom. The shower was amazing and welcomed after a long day of walking and enjoying the sights. The small fridge came handy to store milk and water. Room has a kettle. Nice large TV with good choice of channels and direct Netflix access. Reception staff were helpful and courteous at all times. I guess the only down side for was being charged for making minor stains on the sofa and considering we had a family room with kids staying for nine nights this could have been overlooked. We didn’t make a fuss so the hotel is not at fault for responding to our issue. We used the pizza express across the road a few times - sometimes to just a drink as it has nice outside area. I would recommend this hotel if you looking for an apartment only central location. The WiFi device was very handy.",Date of stay: October 2017,Butterfly on Wellington,4,"Hong Kong, China"
Friendly staff and nice food,"Food is as expected at pizza express but I wanted to add a comment on the staff who were courteous, friendly, fun and made our visits enjoyable. We stayed across the road and visited a few times sometimes just for a drink (happy hour is a good time to go) or takeaway and eat in. Worth visiting if you fancy a change. Reasonable prices for HK.",Date of visit: October 2017,Pizza Express Wellington,4,"Hong Kong, China"
Must do,We enjoyed our trip up. Queues can be long. It’s short tram journey up. Mall and things to do at then top. We bought tickets in conjunction with your bus company which can save you ticket queues. We walked down the hill to experience the different views and avoid the queues. Views are amazing and it’s definitely one of the must do items.,Date of experience: October 2017,Victoria Peak (The Peak),4,"Hong Kong, China"
Helpful,We found the staff to be very helpful and special mention to Jospeh who assisted us in our needs and advised us as to the best course of action. The tickets can be confusing and a lot to pack in short time so make sure you plan well.,Date of experience: October 2017,Big Bus Tours,4,"Hong Kong, China"
Wonderful,We stayed overnight in a family en-suite whilst visiting Longleat. Simple check in and easy to find. Our room wasn't huge but did the job and contained a large double bed with a single fold out bed. Shower was lovely. Grounds are beautiful and worth taking a wander around. For evening dining we wandered around Frome but nothing took our fancy only to end up around the corner at the Mason Arms pub which was lovely. Breakfast in the cafe was delicious. Overall a lovely stop over with friendly welcoming staff.,Date of stay: July 2017,The Lighthouse,4,"Frome, United Kingdom"
Entertaining although quite small,"We visited during Easter and managed to get around the park quite quickly so pace yourself. A good selection of animals with our favourite being the gorillas. Nice picnic areas and staff presenting the animals talk were hit and miss. The main cafe as you enter the park was wonderful with a great selection of ice teas, gluten free tarts and cakes and we were all highly impressed.",Date of experience: April 2017,Jersey Zoo,4,"Jersey, United Kingdom"
"Friendly, child friendly and awesome staff","We visited during Easter for 5 nights staying in the family room (1A). The location is amazing with amazing views and ample options for cliff walks. No shops nearby. The accommodation was comfortable although as many previous reviewers have noted requires modernising very soon - hence 4 instead of 5 stars.

But what we really enjoyed the most was the food. Both breakfast and evening meals were all amazing and served by friendly staff. No request was too much and always served with a smile.

Checkout was easy. Ample parking opposite.",Date of stay: April 2017,Prince of Wales,4,"Jersey, United Kingdom"
One night visit went well,We had three double rooms booked. Kids enjoyed the rooftop pool with its retractable roof. The staff were helpful. Breakfast was good value for money with hot and cold buffet. The parking downstairs is tight but low cost. Location is a few miles away from central but relatively easy to navigate by bus and subway. The tour buses stop about 20 mins walk away opposite the Zoo. Rooms were spacious clean and I'm pleased the windows open so no stuffy feeling. We would recommend.,Date of stay: October 2016,Mercure Lisboa,4,"Lisbon, Portugal"
We loved it,We booked based on the reviews and weren't disappointed. We had two apartments - a one bedroom and a two bedroom conveniently located in the same block. The location is quiet which is what we wanted. The staff are super friendly and willing to help. We asked if the rooms had a DVD player and the Manager did his best to accommodate. When we ran out of coffee one morning they kindly provided theirs. We cooked in the Apartments and found an appropriate number of utensils and all the appliances worked well. A short walk to the shops. We found a play area behind the complex that kept the kids busy when they weren't in the pool. Overall we would definitely recommend.,Date of stay: October 2016,Sagres Time Apartamentos,4,"Sagres, Portugal"
Wow - a real gem,"We visited twice during our one week stay. We found the food, service and ambiance a real delight. It's not very big and on both occasions we asked our hotel to book ahead (and luckily we did as they were turning people away). The octopus rice was amazing as was the fish rice. Fresh fish will depend on what's in that day. The deserts were great. It's family run so probably a bit overwhelmed when full so service may be a bit slow but what's the rush? Your in Sagres so relax and enjoy. Would definitely recommend.",Date of visit: October 2016,A Sagres,4,"Sagres, Portugal"
Entertaining,"As per other reviews, a must for fans. We arrived 30mins early and proceeded to join the moving queue. Took about 2.5 hours to get around. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend.",Date of experience: September 2016,Warner Bros. Studio Tour London - The Making of Harry Potter,4,"Leavesden, United Kingdom"
A good day out,We enjoyed our visit. Definitely aimed towards 10 and under. We took our own picnic so cannot comment on food. Staff were friendly. It's not a big place so you can get around to trying all the rides. Max we queued was 30mins. Ample parking and free. Easy to get to off M1. Yes some of the rides are getting a bit tired so soon it will need a refurb but nothing spoilt our fun.,Date of experience: August 2016,Gulliver's Land,4,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom"
Beautiful high class hotel,"A very beautifully set up hotel with a grand entrance and immaculate hallways and lobbies. Our luxury twin room was larger than most with a spacious bathroom. We were facing the back so very little noise and rooms seemed solid.

It's a shame the hotel charges for use of the pool - we didn't go in the end but could have done with a swim.

The staff were all very helpful. They were polite, courteous and immaculately presented. We had to make changes via Expedia but hotel honoured the rates agreed.

The hotel provided discounted vouchers for breakfast at 1000 yen which considering Tokyo and the buffet offering is good value for money. We also tried the small ramen places across the road which were amazing.

Hotel offers free transfer to subway (takadanobaba) but check times. It's about 30min walk. Waseda station is about 10min walk but no bus transfer.

Overall it's a very good hotel. Would definitely recommend.",Date of stay: September 2016,RIHGA Royal Hotel Tokyo,4,"Shinjuku, Japan"
Wonderful,A beautiful park to walk around. Our boys enjoyed playing in the streams and spotting the lovely wildlife. The cafe was wonderful. Nearby play area is also a nice break from the park. Free ample parking also very helpful.,Date of experience: August 2016,Rickmansworth Aquadrome,4,"Rickmansworth, United Kingdom"
Good but depends....,We ordered lunch at 12pm sharp on a sunny Sunday afternoon just before it started to get busy so managed to get served but I could see customers waiting for ages to place their order and deciding to go elsewhere. The order at the bar concept was also lost on a few customers as they took a seat and waited only realising after a while they had to order first. Staff were very pleasant and we enjoyed the burgers immensely so on that basis we would recommend. Decor is new and going thru a few teething issues,Date of visit: July 2016,The Boat House,4,"Saundersfoot, United Kingdom"
A different type of experience,An interesting and educational experience. If you are happy to be close to reptiles and enjoy an opportunity to touch and feed them this a great choice for you. Ian was very knowledgeable and happy to answer lots of questions. Out boys aged 11 and 8 loved it. This is not a Walk in type centre - you will need to book a session in advance.,Date of experience: July 2016,The Reptile Experience,4,"Saundersfoot, United Kingdom"
Enjoyable experience,We enjoyed our dinner at Kookaba. It's a popular restaurant so gets busy and therefore can feel a bit rushed as they try to slot everyone in however we found it useful to have a quick Service what with hungry kids. The swordfish was amazing and our boys loved the ribs. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Portions are large. Would recommend if in town.,Date of visit: July 2016,The Kookaba,4,"Saundersfoot, United Kingdom"
Great food!,"A good family restaurant. All the staff were pleasant and helpful. We enjoyed a selection of ribs, lamb and prawns. Nice decor and great location. A busy place so worth booking in advance.",Date of visit: July 2016,Beachside Barbecue,4,"Saundersfoot, United Kingdom"
A solid family run inn,"We stayed in the large family room which was very spacious and consisted of a double bed and two singles. Beds were firm. Two large sofas help to unwind. Bathroom is also spacious and airy. The inn is family run and all the staff we met were friendly and hospitable. We only had breakfast one morning and even though we were a few minutes late they were very accommodating. The inn is quiet and basically leaves you to it so if you want your space this will work for you. We had drinks in the adjacent pub but no meals. It's all one place so sometimes the reception will be unmanned and you go to then pub if you need anything.

Saundersfoot is a 5 min drive away. Tenby around 10. It was our first time to the area and absolutely loved it and will definitely return.",Date of stay: July 2016,The Woodridge Inn Hotel,4,"Saundersfoot, United Kingdom"
Wow - simply amazing!,"We were immediately impressed with the external and internal décor. It was clear a lot of thought (and hard work!) had gone into the design and it was wonderful to see the old and new merge together. All of the team at Rowley Estates have been extremely professional and supportive in the booking process including providing detailed information on each step. On entering the cottage we found the place to be immaculate. We were in awe of the grand fireplace and the abundant wood supply meant we were never short. The kitchen was of good size and catered for a family of 6. The utensils were of the highest quality as were the pots and pans. We used the webber bbq provided and sat outside on the garden patio until late into the evening.
The other cottages are nearby so you don't feel lonely and there is sufficient space between them to give you your privacy. The bedrooms are all of good size and beds were very comfortable. Overall its a fantastic place to be and we would highly recommend. It's a short drive to Ulswater and the village of Blencow and Greystoke are a short distance away. We found Very easy to find and close to Penrith for major shopping else the smaller surrounding villages cover basic requirements. We found Pooley Bridge to be great fun.",Date of stay: August 2015,Riverain,4,"Howtown, United Kingdom"
Well worth a visit,This is definitely worth a visit. We enjoyed the lovely surroundings and falls themselves. The hike up isn't too bad although you should be careful with kids especially when its wet. The parking is sufficient and loo facilities are provided on the grounds.,Date of experience: August 2015,Aira Force,4,"Penrith, United Kingdom"
Quirky but fun nevertheless,"It's a quirky unassuming place that may leave you feeling like you should have got a bit more for your money. As soon as you enter you are presented with small café / team room and imagine this being a small family run type of place. There is a decent range of birds and its a pleasant walk around to see them. We read there is only one show at 2pm so we got there at 1pm and found we had plenty of time to walk around and wait for the show to start. The presenter is knowledgeable but in our opinion spent too much time talking about non bird related matter trying to assume the crowd and seem to drag things on which meant it being over 2.5 hours. But to be far, you didn't obliged to hang around so it was easy to step away and come back if needed - esp for those with younger children. We finished the afternoon with lovely tea and scones in the warm albeit small café. We'd recommended a visit but go with an open mind.",Date of experience: August 2015,Lakeland Bird of Prey Centre,4,"Penrith, United Kingdom"
Fun filled afternoon,"It's easy to find and sprawled over a large area. Overall we found the instructors were helpful and entertaining. We hadn't booked and on arrival the younger staff member wasn't very accommodating but luckily a senior member took over and managed to set us up with an itinerary for the day that suited our needs. This was bank holiday weekend so full of larger groups.

Our two boys (under 10) enjoyed the JCB challenge of having operate to a real life JCB to lift and place tyres. Clay pigeon shooting and Archery were similar to what you'd expect elsewhere although as mentioned the instructors were very nice and accommodating. The fishing pond helped to kill time in between and although we didn't catch one we did see others.

We didn't use the food caravan but there is one there although it closed around 3ish. You may want to take a packaged lunch if there all day with family / kids.",Date of experience: August 2015,Rookin House Activity Centre,4,"Troutbeck, United Kingdom"
Enjoyable stay at the Radisson Blu,"The hotel is clean, modern and easy to navigate. The staff were efficient in their service and we felt well looked after. We had a double room for a single night. Pool is small but sufficient. Sauna and Spa were as expected - nothing too fancy but did the job well. We had a wonderful massage (apologies, I forgot her name) and a reasonable price. For an airport hotel this seemed much better than ones I've been to before and you don't hear any airplane noise. I would have preferred it we could open our hotel room window rather than rely on the air conditioning system but just a minor point.",Date of stay: August 2015,"Radisson Blu Hotel, East Midlands Airport",4,"Castle Donington, United Kingdom"
An enjoyable afternoon for the kids and fantastic museum for the adults,Definitely a must go if you are in the area. The farm is well set out with plenty of animals and space to enjoy. The kids really enjoyed the rope in the haystacks - spent hours trying the different heights. The antique cars and motorbikes in the museum were amazing and took you back in time. We didn't eat in the café but did browse around the shop. Parking is good albeit it can get a little tight so be aware as you park up. Would recommend a visit.,Date of experience: August 2015,Stonehurst Family Farm and Museum,4,"Mountsorrel, United Kingdom"
