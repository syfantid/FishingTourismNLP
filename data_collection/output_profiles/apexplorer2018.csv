100% must do,"I cannot say enough about our yoga experience with Evi. We went on one of the morning weekend days, and had the entire setting of the moon rocks by the water all to ourselves. My husband and I were at different skill and comfort levels with yoga. Evi's relaxed style and excellent ability to explain the moves as we went made it very accessible, and unlike his experiences in other yoga studios, my husband really enjoyed this class and now would like to continue regularly when we return home! I would 100% recommend to anyone, whatever your skill level.",Date of experience: September 2018,Yoga Journey,5,"Milos, Greece"
Stunning Fishing and Swimming!,"We had an absolutely wonderful time on this trip and would highly recommend it to anyone considering it. The waters of Poliegos are incredibly beautiful, and it was really fun to see what we caught and have a beautifully cooked meal with the sea catch! Nikos and Frossa also were able to give us lots of insights about the area and good places to go, me it was a much more personal experience than a lot of the other boating trips we explored. I would 100% recommend!",Date of experience: September 2018,Milos Fishing Experience,5,"Milos, Greece"
