Fantastic experience in Santorini,"Captain Anthi and her crew are fantastic guides and help you experience Santorini in a different way

We had never done fishing before but they teach you and help you and in the end you get to eat what you catch! Fishing is done responsibly, any small catch is brought back to the water, and they don’t use any dragging nets that destroy the sea beds.

While Anthi and the crew prepared everything for fishing you can do some snorkeling which is lovely.

The food was probably some of the best we have eaten. Fresh salad, grilled veggies and rice with grilled and fried fish. Delicious. Extremely recommended and if we come back to Santorini we are definitely doing it again!

We went as a couple but it’s also a great activity for families",,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
