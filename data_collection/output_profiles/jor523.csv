Amazing Sunset,"We visited here to have dinner, drinks and watch the sunset.

The view was incredible, defiantly a place to visit.

Service wasn’t so good. When arriving we were sat to our table and then had to wait around 30 mins for someone to even come take our drinks order, once ordered drinks arrived quickly and we were given a drink as an apology.

After our wine tasting we wanted to order a bottle of wine, again we sat waiting, we asked a waiter for them to say they would need to find our waiter, after about 20 minutes we finally ordered a drink.

The wine is lovely and would recommend the 16 wine flight.",Date of experience: July 2018,Santo Winery,3,"Santorini, Greece"
Must do Activity!!! Amazing day!!,"What a fantastic trip, we opted for the sunset fishing trip and it did not disappoint, from start to finish the whole thing was great fun. It’s a very well run business and the crew are ace, such lovely people and aid to your every need! We caught Octopus, eel and so many varied fish! I even caught a rofus whilst using the rods! The crew knew about every fish going, therefore making it an actual fun, intellectual day! The food the crew cooked was delicious we tried about 10 different fish, the eel and octopus, not to mention the rice/noodle dish, amazing!!!
Thanks for having us and we will be definitely re booking if we are back in Santorini.",Date of experience: July 2018,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,3,"Santorini, Greece"
