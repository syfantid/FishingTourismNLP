Quick meal close to chapel allerton,"Booked a table for 19.30 on a Saturday - it’s busy so do advise booking. Had a nice walk from chapel a through the woods.

The restaurant was buzzing when we arrived and it looked like people from all over Leeds and indeed the world we’re all getting stuck into some amazing looking and smelling food.

The menu is full of interesting dishes and the waitress was really helpful. The korean bottles beer is delicious which we dipped whilst deciding.

We orders the signature dish of fried chicken o a chilli sauce for stagers and it was delicious. The mains were also excellent.

This is my new favourite place to eat in north leeds! Can’t wait to go again. Not too poncy, easy going and delivers on the service and food front.",Date of visit: February 2020,Yokohama,4,"Leeds, United Kingdom"
Family meal - 5pm,"This is a great restaurant - one of my favourite in Leeds city centre. It’s a shame others haven’t enjoyed it as much as our group of 8 - 5 adults and 3 kids - did. We ordered a mix of traditional Anglo/Chinese dishes and authentic Chinese dishes. They were all delicious, fresh and cooked excellently. Expect a fantastic range of flavours - hot (& if you want it VERY hot) sour, savoury and a range of different textures. This place works brilliantly for both the adventurous and those playing it safe. The service is prompt and very Chinese. Don’t go expecting an Italian type family welcome but expect polite, courteous and helpful staff. As it caters for the local Chinese community some of the staff don’t speak amazing English - they still speak fluently - but for me this adds to the experience. Thanks Red Chilli for a great early evening meal and experience. Stand out dish - for me - was lamb chops with chilli, cumin and salt. Also massive portions.",Date of visit: January 2020,Red Chilli,4,"Leeds, United Kingdom"
A cracker of a hotel,"Loved this hotel. Done to the style of a Rajasthani palace to a very high standard. The service is personable and they treat you as an individual - nothing is too much. They upgraded us to a suite and we felt like royalty - interestingly there was a picture of the British royal family tiger hunting in the 1950s.

The furniture is often antique and there’s loads of interesting original pieces - you can actually just walk round losing yourself in the ambience of the place.

The pool is great - not many places so get there early!

We loved the restaurant and the nightly show of Rajasthani music and dancing.

I would heartily you come stay - this is a great base for your trip to Jaipur as after you’ve seen the city’s amazing sites you get back to the hotel and continue your adventure.

Oh and the food in the restaurant is excellent with very good prices and high quality local and European food.

We were sad to leave as we got really fond of this friendly and quirky hotel.",Date of stay: April 2019,Umaid Bhawan Heritage House Hotel,4,"Jaipur, India"
What a game changer!! Excellent driver,"Sometimes in India you really need a friendly and trustworthy face to help guide you through all of the crazy and amazing things you find yourself experiencing.

These guys are that friendly face.

We had our best day of our travels today when Bhawani arrived promptly on time - gave us a lovely fresh flower garland each and drove us in a spotless car from Agra to Jaipur stopping at really interesting spots on the way - including an excellent lunch. The route is very interesting and a contrast to our experiences in Agra which we liked but it’s undoubtedly a challenging place to like.

Bhawani is a very talented driver, speaks good English and couldn’t be more helpful. He is also very funny and we spent much of the journey smiling and laughing as we swapped stories and he provided a fascinating commentary as we drove along.

This was our second driver of our trip - the other experience with another company was no where near as good.

I couldn’t recommend this company more. Just go and book it and enjoy your trip.",Date of experience: April 2019,India By Car and Driver,4,"Jaipur, India"
Unforgettable day,"Met warmly by the lovely couple who run this boat we headed straight out to sea and collected two 1km nets. All packed with a wide range of fish. We all helped unpick the fish which was great fun and really informative. We then cruised for some swimming on a secluded beach and then to another - whilst the food was prepared - a bonus was that the next beach had some clay reserves which we liberally applied to ourselves and then lay in the sun baking like ceramic pots. A quick wash then food time. It was perfect in every way - fresh - really really really fresh! organic, locally produced salad and wine (from their own land) and cooked with love, care and attention! A meal we’ll never forget. The boat isn’t crowded at all and as a result we all got to know each other and had some good chats and laughs as we cruised back to the harbour - where we met and fed a friendly turtle called Tony! Do this trip it’s fantastic.",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Outstanding,I’ve recently started working more from home and sneak into Amands for lunch. It’s outstanding. The Thali makes a perfect filling but light lunch and is excellent value. The pakora chaat is likewise. The service is excellent - really friendly and helpful. Value wise - it’s very good. This part of harehills is really multicultural cultural and sitting in the window munching on lovely zingy food whilst watching the world pass by is indeed a pleasure.,Date of visit: June 2018,Anand Sweets,4,"Leeds, United Kingdom"
Perfect stop off to Coast and for Plitvice Lakes,"We stopped for two nights on our way from Slovenia to Zadar. The owners are really friendly and even presented us with some complimentary and delicious plum brandy and the lovely mother gave us some excellent home made strudel. We spent the first evening at the impressive Rastoke (15 minute walk) and had some nice trout. The next day we drove 30 minutes to Plitvice lake. We came back and had some dinner locally and just chilled in the apartment. This was our 3rd location in 5 days and the standard of accommodation, the service and the genuine friendliness of the owners really marked it out. Excellent knowledge of the awesome but woeful Leeds United too!",Date of stay: August 2014,Apartments Lucic,4,"Plitvica, Croatia"
The best in Leeds,"We've eaten regularly at Rajas for the last 20 years - and it's the best Indian food I've had in leeds. The food is punjabi in origin and a step above the 'bog standard' generic, gravy pot fare. Excellent fish pakoras, superb lamb saag and the vegetable curries are very very good. The service is also very friendly and helpful. The owner is someone whom clearly cares about both his food and customers - and this is reflected in the consistency and quality. My only concern is that it'll ever change!",Date of visit: May 2014,Raja's Restaurant,4,"Leeds, United Kingdom"
Big improvement,"This used to be a grim pub. But the new landlords have breathed in life. Good value food with some interesting fish specials, couple of good real ales and a bit of a refurb. We went for an early dinner with a large group after the, very wet, Gargrave show. With numerous kids we were probably a bit of a headache but they were great and really looked after us. I hope the new owners prosper. The swans a great pub and I look forward to returning (without kids).",Date of visit: August 2013,The Old Swan Inn,4,"Gargrave, United Kingdom"
An oasis in Nerja,"They, the media, say the best Morrocan food is cooked at home. After spending many years in both nerja and the costa tropical I've yet to have a meal that's truly made me feel great. There's always a self indulgent niggle. A surly waiter or an overly greasy plate of fried fish. This place is great though. Not the most breath taking location but away from the tourist bustle. It's family run and great service. The cooking is done by the mother and all fresh to the order. We had two beautiful soups - made with fantastic stocks followed by a deep, aromatic lamb tagine and a clean, simple but delicious chicken with couscous. I wasn't expecting great wine - but we got a great bottle of red. I really enjoyed the food here but especially liked the family. They care about good food and your enjoyment. I felt like I was eating in their home. So they're right. On a more shallow level, they have serve yourself beer pumps on the tables, which, obviously, is a massive risk/ plus for any Brits planning going! Great and special place. A true oasis.",Date of visit: August 2013,Oasis of Marrakesh,4,"Nerja, Spain"
A little treat -simple but good,"We come every year to the pool and when we can't be bothered to go home for a sandwich at lunch stop by at one of the two pool bars - they're always fine but not great. This year though sink or swim (A name to ponder) has been great. Truly fantastic home made chips, really good fish and very good value have ensured our ham and cheese have stayed in the fridge. A special big up goes to the Scottish waitress who is just great. Full marks to the lady chef who endlessly toils in a tiny kitchen. I hope they make lots of money - they deserve it.",Date of visit: July 2013,Sink Or Swim Nerja,4,"Nerja, Spain"
All I wanted!,"I'm normally a little dubious about restaurant reviews on here, however not on this instance. This is a very good restaurant with great service & v good food. We started with a local and excellently brewed gin and tonic. To eat we had the ham and tomato on bread which was beautiful and plentiful. We followed with an excellent paella. This was served in a tomato sauce, I've had some delicious and authentic paella in Valencia but this was quite different but still very good. Our daughter devoured a very nice ham and tomato pizza. All the way through the service was friendly and attentive. The final bill made me even happier. My only regret was I couldn't try more of the menu. This is a restaurant where the owners care about food and service, not something you'd normally expect in such a wonderful location. Go here!",,Puerta Grande,4,"Ronda, Spain"
