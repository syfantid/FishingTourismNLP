Excellent food and service,"Had to wait a short while to get a table which is a good sign
Been here before back in 2011 and food is still superb
Make sure you visit this restaurant during your stay",Date of visit: May 2019,Papillon Restaurant,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Best Restaurant in Argassi,"Found this restaurant through trip advisor
A little off the main road at the end of resort but well worth the walk
Friendly staff delicious food not too big portions but just enough
We went twice during our week and would definitely recommend",Date of visit: May 2019,Peppermint Restaurant Fresh Kitchen,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Fantastic day out,"Zante fishing tours is an early start but well worth it
Georgio the captain is an excellent host and the small group of 12 made it more interesting
You will see and learn traditional methods of fishing in Zakynthos and the lunch of spaghetti and squid ,homemade bread Local Wine and fried fish which had just been caught can only be described as a feast
Highly recommended
