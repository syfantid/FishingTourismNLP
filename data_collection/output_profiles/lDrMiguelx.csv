Fantastic food!,Never visited before but we will definitely be back. The food was delicious to go with the modern decor. Fairly priced for the portions received and staff are very friendly! 5*,Date of visit: September 2019,The Red Lion,4,"Hawkshaw, United Kingdom"
What an experience!,"We were bought a ‘Gincident’ tour as a gift and what an experience this was! We knew we were going to try some gins but not to this scale, just look at the photos! Tom who hosted the event was fantastic and introduced us to the famous ‘Helga’ story, whilst having us in stitches all the way through. We also won a bottle of gin and my partner smashed the ‘Gin Face’ game! Rum tour next with a few friends but you will absolutely love being part of a cruise if you get yourself booked in! Thanks to everyone involved!",Date of experience: June 2019,The Liquorists,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
"Great, private speakeasy!","We’ve been to The Washhouse on numerous occasions previously and we will always return. It’s rare to find a small, intimate location where you can actually hear your partner speak and enjoy a quality drink without being surrounded by pretentious people in Manchester. The staff here are brilliant and always make you feel welcome. If you want to get away from the usual Manchester life, book a table here and you won’t be disappointed!",Date of experience: May 2019,The Washhouse,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Always love it here!,"Re-visited here with the partner for our anniversary and we are never disappointed. The staff are always really friendly and welcoming and compared to other ridiculously expensive establishments, Gino’s gives you quality food at a fair price. Definitely be back!",Date of visit: May 2019,Gino D'Acampo,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Great views and scenery!,Great on a warm day to walk to and enjoy the surrounding scenery. You can help yourself to some water too if you have a bottle spare!,Date of experience: May 2019,Chalice Well,4,"Glastonbury, United Kingdom"
Awesome place to visit!,"We visit Glastonbury once a year and we’re so happy to find this place! Definitely on our list for future visits as a ‘must’. Staff were very friendly and welcoming, the food was perfect and the drinks that were available were refreshing and made you want more. The Appleflopper we tried is one of the best ciders I’ve ever tasted. Keep up the good work guys, we will be back!",Date of visit: May 2019,Rose and Portcullis,4,"Butleigh, United Kingdom"
Gets better with every visit!,"I visited when I was a lot younger and only remembered going through caves, however visiting at a later stage in life, you take in the cool air and stunning cave formations. Cheese is stored in the caves, giving the perfect temperature for storage, as well as numerous wedding ceremonies and divers exploring even further! More of the caves were open to the public and it seems the more that’s discovered, the bigger the tour will be. Make sure you get some cheese or at least try some, you won’t be disappointed!",Date of experience: May 2019,Wookey Hole Caves,4,"Wookey Hole, United Kingdom"
Great tasting food!,"Accidentally stumbled across The Ashcott as we were due to eat somewhere else, but due to a power cut, a member of the local community recommended we visited here. Great food available with friendly staff with portions being a great size too! Definitely return to The Ashcott on our return to Wells / Glastonbury!",Date of visit: May 2019,The Ashcott,4,"Ashcott, United Kingdom"
So good we took back litres of the stuff!,"A tradition through generations brought us to The Somerset Cider Brandy Company. A very popular place with the locals and tourists, selling ‘proper’ cider as well as other unique drinks. Be back next year to pick some more up!",Date of experience: May 2019,Somerset Cider Brandy Company,4,"Martock, United Kingdom"
Like being a child all over again!,"When you open the door, it’s like taking a step back in time to when you were a child. It took me ages to figure out what I wanted and I could’ve easily spent so much! Great to see shops like this still around.",Date of experience: October 2019,Ye Olde Sweet Shoppe,4,"Wells, United Kingdom"
Stunning piece of architecture!,The photos taken don’t do this building enough justice. The rain was hammering it down as I was taking photos and admiring what was standing before me. Great to see up close and from a distance.,Date of experience: May 2019,Wells Cathedral,4,"Wells, United Kingdom"
Great place to relax and soak in the architecture!,"Not being local to Wells at all, we wanted to visit for the local culture where we stumbled across The Bishop’s Palace and Gardens. Very peaceful and a lovely plot to stroll around and admire.",Date of experience: May 2019,The Bishop's Palace and Gardens,4,"Wells, United Kingdom"
Great place to stop off for a cider or two!,"Friendly, warm welcome and a good selection of drinks available. Most definitely worth a visit if you are in and around Glastonbury!",Date of visit: May 2019,The George and Pilgrims,4,"Glastonbury, United Kingdom"
Awesome food and drink!,We’d been recommended this place and it definitely lived up to the expectation. The cider available was fantastic and the food tasted amazing! Keep up the great work!,Date of visit: May 2019,The Who'd A Thought It Inn Restaurant,4,"Glastonbury, United Kingdom"
Home away from home!,"First glamping trip with the partner and this place has set the bar ridiculously high! The complex was spotless and well kept, with a great range of accommodation on-site. A private fishing pool was also available to us which we took full advantage of - I’d recommend fishing on prawn for some good fish! If you get the opportunity, order a pizza from the cart that visits on site as they were delicious! Plenty of facilities available too if you don’t wish to move from the site! Be back next year!",Date of stay: May 2019,Old Oaks Touring Park and Glamping,4,"Glastonbury, United Kingdom"
Definitely be back!,"After recently making our own sushi, me and my partner decided to visit Yo! Sushi with a voucher I’d previously won. I’d never been to Yo! Sushi, however my partner loves it, so I opted for the Arndale branch and I wasn’t disappointed. Queuing is definitely worth the wait and definitely ask for a both so you can enjoy the food in comfort. We didn’t pay a penny (because of the voucher), however I would’ve happily paid for the food as we had a great laugh with the staff making the sushi. The food here is fresh and tastes great! Will definitely make it a habit to buy more sushi from Yo! Sushi.",Date of visit: March 2019,Yo! Sushi Manchester Arndale,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Great evening with friends!,"As a group of 7 friends, we decided to visit West Ivy for a catch up. The location is pretty much plonked on the pavement and you can’t miss it, but inside is a very nice vibe. The food and drink here is spot on and we all had a great night! You can also book afternoon tea sessions which other friends have recommended highly! If you haven’t visited yet, get yourself down to West Ivy for a good meal/drink!",Date of visit: March 2019,West Ivy,4,"Bury, United Kingdom"
Great curry!,"Three of us decided to visit after we heard the good reviews and also read the low reviews on here but as we love a good curry, we went in open-minded. I had booked a table for 4 originally but one person pilsner make it - Not a problem for when we turned up. We had great service all night and the food was great. We were all starving and the portion size throughout was a fair size! Not too sure why people have bad reviews on here as we never had additional extras on the bill or bad service - We actually we’re given extra food! We will be back soon!",Date of visit: March 2019,Hot Chilli Indian Restaurant,4,"Bolton, United Kingdom"
Glorious breakfast!,"Partner recommended here after a hard night celebrating my 30th - Just what the doctor ordered! Full English cooked perfectly and it tasted ace! Never been to Bill’s prior to this visit, however, I’ll definitely be going back!",Date of visit: February 2019,Bill's Spinningfields,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Amazing Chinese food and hospitality!,"My partner chose to go here for her birthday and we were treated so well, everyone loved the evening! I had organised with Charlie via email to bring out a cake after the meal and to have a cocktail ready for my partner - Both came out perfectly on top of the faultless service and friendliness of everyone on the night. The food was wonderful - This was our second visit and we will definitely be back soon. Thanks to all for a wonderful evening!",Date of visit: February 2019,8 Manchester,4,"Whitefield, United Kingdom"
Easy place to eat and very cheap for portion size!,"We visited here with a couple of friends for a quick catch up and the place catered the 4 of us and a new born very well. A high chair was supplied instantly and before you knew it our food was with us! For the portion size, the food was ridiculously cheap! Highly recommend for a cheap filling meal.",Date of visit: December 2018,"Waterfold Farm, Dining & Carvery",4,"Bury, United Kingdom"
Amazing experience for any Potter fan!,"I decided to treat my girlfriend for her 30th to a visit here but when it was ‘Hogwarts in the Snow’ - I’m so glad we waited as being Christmas-themed made the experience that little more special. I won’t spoil the tour for anybody but any fans of Harry Potter will not want to leave! If visiting in the colder months, keep your coat/warm clothing as you do go outside on the tour. You will need to factor in the tour will be guided for the first 15 minutes and then you can leisurely enjoy the tour yourselves. Expect to be there between 3-4 hours and make sure you try a Butter Beer as it’s only 1 of 4 locations in the World that sells the beverage. Amazing experience!",Date of experience: December 2018,Warner Bros. Studio Tour London - The Making of Harry Potter,4,"Leavesden, United Kingdom"
Finally got to visit and wasn’t disappointed!,"I’d be nagging my partner for ages how much I wanted to visit Tru Street in the Trafford Centre just from looking at the menu walking past. We had met up with another couple and decided to give it a try - to which we were all made up with the choice. The food was spot on and very very filling; I myself had the 15” hot dog and devoured it! The wings for starters were also very tasty and sticky! If you’re in the Trafford Centre, pop by and have s look at the menu - the food here is top quality and the price is fair for the portions and service you receive.",Date of visit: November 2018,Tru Street,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Cheap as chips!?!,"Me and my partner had heard and seen plenty of the franchise around Paphos and decided we would have our late lunch here before we flew back home - I was still full when we landed back in England! I ordered a chicken club sandwich which I thought would come with a bowl of chips, not surrounded by chips! It was so filling and for the price I was amazed at the amount of food I was presented with. If you like to enjoy an ‘English’ meal, especially for children, visit one of the franchises and you’ll feel like you’re eating at home. The staff here were very friendly and efficient. I’d highly recommend for a cheap and filling lunch.",Date of visit: November 2018,Tea for Two,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
Hands down the best excursion ever!,"I honestly don’t know where to start - let’s just say I would travel all the way to Cyprus, just to do this again. For the price you pay - you won’t find a better ‘value for money’ day out guaranteed. We were informed by our friends who were staying nearby of the excursion and we decided to go for it. Upon arrival, we got to choose our buggy where you can store bags, cameras and water (highly recommended). Setting off as a group, you’ll drive up to the Adonis baths where you’ll get to soak up a hidden gem away from the usual hustle and bustle! I would recommend jumping in the water if you’re brave enough! From there, we made our way up to the Shipwreck, allowing us to crack out the drone to take some unique photos and then onto the Agios Georgios Musuem. Stunning views of the bay and the architecture was instantly worth the money alone. We ended up along a beach trail all the way to Turtle Bay where we were covered in sand but smiling and laughing all the way! We had the opportunity to wash off the sand in the sea and explore the turtle nests scattered all over the place! We were then taken to a remote hut where we were served chicken and wedges which was amazing! I was actually sad that the excursion was over, as I’d never experienced as much fun for the price you pay and to have everything included was a steal. Our guide was top quality and looked after everyone. Honestly, my review does not do this place justice. If you have a day spare, forget your tour excursions - get yourself down here and book on for the following day and you will gain memories that will stick with you forever. This is 100% the first thing I will do when I next visit Cyprus as I’d be silly not to!",Date of experience: October 2018,Chris Andreou Quad Buggy And Jeep Safari Tours,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
Champion in two separate countries!,"I put my ‘Champion’ status on the line in Cyprus by taking on 3 other competitive players and needless to say, it was an uphill battle from the start. If you’re playing for fun, then skip the practice holes but if you’re competing, get to terms with the fact the pace is quick! Eventually I caught up everyone and won by 5 shots. For what you play, the price is very cheap, especially if you want to play another round as you get a discount on your next game if you play again straight away. We were a 10 minute walk away from our hotel however you can visit using the hop on-hop off bus where you can play for an hour and hop back on easily. We all had a great laugh and encountered a few lizards on the way trying to put us off, but a great laugh nonetheless!",Date of experience: October 2018,Island Cove Adventure Mini Golf,4,"Geroskipou, Cyprus"
Best Chinese in Paphos,"We visited here on our final night with another couple to enjoy a Chinese meal away from home. You’ll find the restaurant is located up a flight of stairs, where you’ll be greeted by friendly staff. The food portions here are very filling and we found the evening to be so cheap for the quality and portion size. The food is very well presented and tastes even better than it looks. How people can t give this place 5* is beyond me!",Date of visit: October 2018,Xiang Gong Chinese Restaurant,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
Great hotel to visit,"We were guests of a wedding taking place at the hotel and whilst we were walking up along the beach front, we knew instantly that this hotel was the perfect choice. The secluded section overlooking the sea was just right as onlookers could see but not enter, whereas other hotels had their sections practically on the front where people could basically be in your photos in their beach wear.

The hotel itself boasted its very own nightclub which allowed us to enjoy the free bar until 01:00 - safe to say we all had a really amazing evening. The ladies were provided soft slippers to rest their feet and the whole experience was a credit to the bride and groom. If you’re looking to get married in Cyprus, this hotel needs serious consideration in your decision purely on the secluded location alone.

We also obtained all-inclusive passes from 10:00 which we would enjoy cocktails from the start. Certainly worthy of the 5* reputation.",Date of stay: October 2018,Olympic Lagoon Resort Paphos,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
Delicious local food,"Me and my partner knew this place would be heaving on the night so decided to get there a little earlier. We were told we could sit and enjoy a beer as they couldn’t serve food but it would guarantee us a table - which we happily obliged to and before we knew it, the place was packed and we could order first! We opted for the Meze where we were presented with the local delicacies by the plates! It was all amazing but very VERY filling between the two of us. The staff were extra friendly and looked after us well - if you’re out in the harbour, try some local food by visiting here. You’ll be well looked after and the food will make you want to visit again.",Date of visit: October 2018,Gourmet Taverna,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
So good we went twice!,"On a hot day in Cyprus - what more could you possibly want! I opted for a sundae and I felt like I made the right choice. However, looking at everyone else’s options, you honestly couldn’t choose a wrong ice cream! Nice and relaxing when you sit outside in the shade enjoying a delicious ice cream! This would be ideal for kids if you’re nearby to keep them quiet for a little while whilst you enjoy not only the peace, but the tasty desserts on offer! You pay after you have ordered and eaten and the prices are very fair for the portions you receive.",Date of visit: October 2018,Häagen-Dazs,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
Stunning building!,"Another stop on our excursion allowed us to stop-off at the Agios Georgios Musuem and what a nice visit it was. You will not only get an opportunity to ring a church bell yourself, but feast your eyes or architectural brilliance and to top it off, a view of the bay! We took some drone photos just to show you what you can see when visiting. Definitely worth a venture out if you have the time!

The archaeological site of Agios Georgios at the Pafos (Paphos) village of Pegeia is a famous place of pilgrimage for the region. Excavations that began in the 1950’s uncovered significant evidence of an Early Christian settlement.

The excavations unearthed three Early Christian Basilicas and a bath from the 6th century, whilst later excavations (in the nineties) revealed an extensive unwalled settlement that occupied the neck and the south slope of the cape in the Roman and early Christian periods.

The settlement flourished under Justinian I (527 - 565 AD), and its advantageous position suggests that it was probably a port of call for ships transporting grain from Egypt to Constantinople.

The necropolis lies at the brow of the cliff with tombs carved into the rock. Located at the centre of the settlement - on the neck of the cape - is the large three-aisled ‘Basilica A’ with a baptistery adjacent on its west side. A smaller three-aisled basilica with a transept is annexed to the north side of the baptistery.

The three-aisled ‘Basilica B’ lies at the foot of the southern slope of the cape, whilst the remains of the small three-aisled ‘Basilica C’ lie to the northeast of the settlement, with adjacent structures along the north side of a sacristy, oil press, well, guest-house, and courtyard.

The place of pilgrimage of Agios Georgios is located between the site of the basilicas and the necropolis. There is also a small chapel founded in the late 13th - early 14th century also named after Agios Georgios. The stone built church of Agios Georgios was built more recently.",Date of experience: October 2018,Agios Georgios Museum,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
One for the memory book!,"Whilst on our excursion, this was our first destination - and what a place it was to start! The drive alone was so much fun in our off-road buggy and once we arrived, you could tell you were in a remote section of Paphos. You could feel the cool air surrounding the location from the waterfalls and once inside, you could either make your way down to the pool you can jump in, or power your way on up to the waterfall above whilst looking at the pool below. Both were extremely cold but I needed waking up a little and was the only silly person around to jump in the lower pool. I would recommend you be a little careful as the water is very VERY fresh and gives you a quick cooling sensation when entering. However, the pictures me and my partner managed to take of ourselves will live with us forever. Fantastic little place off the beaten path - one for your visit if you enjoy excursions.",Date of experience: October 2018,Adonis Baths Water Falls,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
Great to admire!,"As a group on an excursion we encountered the shipwreck and not only do you get to enjoy the derelict ship, but the bay itself was amazing to look at. Our friend decided to bring his drone along and what a great idea it was - I’ve added some photos for viewing pleasure. If you’re on certain tours or can hire a vehicle, get yourself out here and enjoy a little hidden gem.",Date of experience: October 2018,Edro III Shipwreck,4,"Peyia, Cyprus"
Large portions at decent prices,A member of our group really fancied visiting here due to wanting ribs so we decided to make it a couples evening and visit. We were sat down and ordered cocktails quickly and before we knew it our starters were out. The food was cooked well and the service couldn’t be faulted. The mains were a good size too! I went with the fajitas which were very tasty! I’d recommend getting a big drink to accompany your meal as the cocktails go down a treat. Fairly priced for the sized meals you get.,Date of visit: October 2018,The Rib Shack,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
Lovely place to stop off,We had visited the Tomb of the Kings and the market before venturing to find somewhere for refreshments and stumbled across this little cafe. The staff were really friendly and shared a laugh with us. The food was fresh and very well priced for what you get. They also own an ice cream shop opposite where you can have desserts to eat after your meal or to take with you on your travels. Would highly recommend visiting if you’re in and around the market.,Date of visit: November 2018,Beatriz Cafe Bistro,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
Wonderful hidden gem!,"Me and my partner decided to tag along on the Saturday to enjoy some lunch with her parents and Nana. We had never stumbled across or heard of The Cross Guns Inn until we visited, but now we won’t forget the place. The decor and refurbished building is a pleasure to enter and the food/drink is spot on! I’d highly recommend having a sandwich with a soup of the day as it is not only well presented, but delicious!

Dating back to 1770, The Cross Guns Inn has been serving the local community for over 250 years.

Following extensive investment and refurbishment, the pub begins an exciting new era as a traditional style public house and restaurant, offering a warm and friendly welcome to regulars and newcomers as well as four legged friends.",Date of visit: November 2018,The Cross Guns Inn,4,"Egerton, United Kingdom"
100% record still intact!,"I was dreading breaking my undefeated winning streak of 12/12 when I decided to jump into Enigmista with 4 friends - who might I add were all new to the Escape Room craze. Nonetheless, we geared up and went in...and ESCAPED! We managed to escape with around 4 minutes to spare and it was great to see the happy faces. 13/13 for myself however it was one of the more enjoyable escape rooms I’ve been in - unfortunately I won’t be giving tips or clues as to what was in there as that’s for you to find out! But believe me, you won’t be disappointed! Thank you to the kind staff on that day too, who made the experience that little more enjoyable!",Date of experience: November 2018,Escape Reality,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Top tasting grub!,Where do I start!?! We had a sharing platter between 11 and it was fantastic! The quality of each dish was superb not to mention the quality service from the staff having jokes and giggles with us all. The cocktails were just the icing on the cake! Happily recommend Mowgli’s to everyone - one to visit if you’re looking to eat in Manchester!,Date of visit: November 2018,Mowgli Street Food,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Great photos and views!,"A great day out for all ages - The Tomb of the Kings is great for stretching your legs and seeking out the best photographs whilst taking in all the history. The underground tombs, many of which date back to the 4th century BC, are carved out of solid rock, and are thought to have been the burial sites of Paphitic aristocrats and high officials up to the third century AD (the name comes from the magnificence of the tombs; no kings were in fact buried here). Some of the tombs feature Doric columns and frescoed walls. Archaeological excavations are still being carried out at the site. The tombs are cut into the native rock, and at times imitated the houses of the living.",Date of experience: October 2018,Tombs of the Kings,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
Great views of the harbour!,"You can explore the inner castle for free however for a small admission of €2.50 each, you can enjoy the views from the top of the castle looking out to sea and the harbour. Worth a visit!",Date of experience: October 2018,Paphos Harbour Castle,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
Best food in Paphos - By a mile!!!,"We stumbled across 7 St. Georges Tavern and were squeezed in (thanks to a cancellation 15 minutes before) where we were sat down and told there were no menus! That’s where it got exciting, the food would just keep coming until you said stop! Local food, to the highest quality and taste, non-stop until you say so...heaven right? We had 7 rounds of food and had to throw in the towel not knowing what was next...but we made sure dessert was also eaten. All staff were so accommodating, especially Ben who took extra time with us to speak about anything and everything. I’m a huge cat fan so to see cats there too made my day. For 4 people, we had 4 bottles of water, 2 large carafes of red wine, unlimited (until we were full) food and dessert and spent €104...how is that even possible. Honestly, if you’re in Cyprus, you book yourself a table here and you enjoy it...it’s impossible not to!",Date of visit: November 2018,7 St. Georges Tavern,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
Fantastic Italian food!,"Our double-couples evening took us here, just opposite the Constantinou Bros hotel where we all enjoyed a very delicious, quality meal. Being our first meal in Cyprus, it set the bar pretty high for all further meals as the level of service and quality of food was spot on! The decor inside and out looked awesome and for what you get in food and service, the price is great! If you like Italian food, make your way here for one night, you won’t be disappointed and the staff will make you feel welcome!",Date of visit: November 2018,mare e monti,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
Loved it!,"Me and my partner decided to stay here for our friends wedding (at the Olympic Lagoon Hotel) as we could have a stroll down the beach and enjoy the scenery. We booked B&B as we were never on the complex however breakfast was spot on - the food is fresh and caters for everybody from cereal, to full English breakfasts! Credit to all staff too, rooms were cleaned without fail and receptionists were very friendly and helpful. For what we paid, the holiday was mega cheap and I’d happily stay here again. If you don’t mind walking a little further, you’ll enjoy staying here whether you move out of the complex or not. Thank you for the company and we hope to be back soon!",Date of stay: November 2018,Aquamare Beach Hotel & Spa,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
Undefeated champion!,"We visited previously as a double-couple where I thrashed my mates who thought it was luck that I won - a defence was on the cards! We rocked up to play on The Temple Ruins Adventure. Safe to say I was under Par again and won! For the admission, 18 holes and fun with your mates, it’s a good, fun activity for everyone to enjoy! Great for when you’re waiting for a movie too! Might be back one day to defend the crown again!",Date of experience: October 2018,Paradise Island Adventure Golf Manchester,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Great atmosphere and food!,My partner recommended The Pack Horse for its dining and view over the countryside and I certainly wasn’t disappointed. Upon arrival we were greeted by a lady that proceeded to tell us the specials of the day and as we sat down if there was anything we would like to drink. Quick service! The food was fresh and made to perfection; very hearty meals. The prices are definitely fair and the level of service is spot on. It seems as though it has had a recent renovation as the decor was great to look at. Definitely be back even though it’s out of the way but it’s certainly worth the drive.,Date of visit: October 2017,The Pack Horse,4,"Affetside, United Kingdom"
One for the album!,"Very popular with tourists and visitors as the bridge definitely stands out from the rest. Decided a picture was needed as the bridge does provide a nice view above to River Liffey. The history of the bridge is also great to soak in. The Ha'penny Bridge, known later for a time as the Penny Ha'penny Bridge, and officially the Liffey Bridge, is a pedestrian bridge built in May 1816 over the River Liffey in Dublin, Ireland. Made of cast iron, the bridge was cast in Shropshire, England.",Date of experience: October 2018,Ha'penny Bridge,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
Blue coffee!?!,Me and my partner decided to grab a quick bite to eat as well as a drink before we left Dublin and decided Insomnia was our place. I chose to try the ‘blue’ coffee which was mainly oats and surprisingly it was alright. The sandwiches provided were good and it was a nice change from the boring Starbucks/Costa we are used to back in England. Great place to relax with friends/family.,Date of visit: October 2018,Insomnia Coffee Company,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
Best entrance to a cocktail bar yet!,"Me and my partner love Speak Easy cocktail bars and this was definitely up there with the best. You will need to book a table as it is forever busy. You’ll be emailed with a location and how to enter once booked and to be secluded and hidden away was great. We decided to eat here as well as order cocktails and we weren’t disappointed. The food was Italian and very tasty - accompanied by the amazing cocktails, completed a great night.",Date of visit: October 2018,The Blind Pig Speakeasy,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
Great architecture across the grounds!,Stunning building with brilliant surroundings. Well worth a visit inside to take it all in (pictures of outside only so I don’t ruin it for you). Great for tourists/sightseers!,Date of experience: October 2018,Dublin Castle,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
Taste the difference!,"The fact this place can make you a rose ice cream cone says it all! I opted against this and went with an energy milkshake which was amazingly refreshing! Located in the mall opposite the theatre, get yourself in for an ice cream/milkshake...you won’t be disappointed!",Date of visit: October 2018,Amorino,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
Another off the list,Always love HRC and now me and my partner have another off our list from around the World! You know what you’re getting when visiting and the decor here in Ireland was great on the eyes!,Date of visit: October 2018,Hard Rock Cafe,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
Oh...my...goodness!!!,"Me and my partner stumbled across The Rolling Donut and was surprised on how much Vegan produce they supply. We aren’t Vegans however The Rolling Donut definitely cater to the ‘here and now era’ and it was flooded with people! The donuts are top quality and I believe we got our 3 donuts for €8. I was lucky to get a bite they were that tasty! If you have children, treat them to one but ensure you treat yourself too! YUM!",Date of visit: October 2018,The Rolling Donut,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
A leap back in time!,"Me and my partner only noticed The Brazen Head thanks to a small sign on the tour bus we took and ensured we made our way down the next day. We both decided to order a full Irish breakfast (why would you order anything else whilst in Ireland) and it was gorgeous! The place filled up like it was about to be demolished and once finished we did a little sightsee to discover plenty of rooms filled with quirky decor and even more guests. Fantastic little treat off the beaten path - a must visit whilst in Ireland!

The Brazen Head is a pub in Merchant's Quay, Dublin. It was built as a coaching inn in 1754, on the site of a merchant's dwelling dating back to at least 1613.Local tradition claims that the site has housed a tavern or alehouse since 1198, although there is no documentary evidence to support this. Kelleher claims it first received a licence to sell ale in 1661, and the first mention of it as an inn occurs in 1668.",Date of experience: October 2018,The Brazen Head,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
The original and best!,"Saturday night and the live music is in full swing - a shame you can’t put videos on here as you’ll be able to see how much fun everyone from all corners of the globe has when visiting! Be prepared to squeeze your way to the bar but sing your heart out getting there. The live duo are fantastic and definitely the best on the Temple Bar stretch. If you go to Temple Bar and not visit the actual pub, you’ll waste your time! Get yourself down, get the beers in and sing until you can’t sing no more!",Date of visit: October 2018,The Temple Bar,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
Gourmet burgers to die for!,"We were recommended to visit by our taxi driver and we weren’t disappointed. Worth queueing up outside for 10 minutes or so and before we knew it, we were served our drinks and food before we could blink! I’d recommend the fries with 3 dips so you can have 1 dip to yourself at least! The Sex on the Farm burger was beautiful and melted in your mouth. Was surprised with the logo stamp on the bun which I thought was a nice touch. Cheap for the quality you get and a must for all groups!",Date of visit: October 2018,Bobos Burgers Restaurant,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
Best day out for tourists in Dublin!,"Where to start! If you want an experience, book at a later time and enjoy the show (that’s all I’m giving you I’m afraid!). Great tour, friendly staff and a bar on the top floor to give you the best views of Dublin/Ireland. If you’ve never tried Guinness,with your admission you have the option to get 1 x free pint or you can choose to select 3 x 1/3 pints to try the range! Guinness Storehouse is a tourist attraction at St. James's Gate Brewery in Dublin, Ireland and since opening in 2000, it has received over four million visitors.",Date of experience: October 2018,Guinness Storehouse,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
IMMA - Art fans unite!,"I decided to not put photos up as it would spoil the trip but I’d recommend visiting if you’re into your art. Entry is free and usually lasts about an hour depending on how much you want to take in. The Irish Museum of Modern Art also known as IMMA, is Ireland's leading national institution for the collection and presentation of modern and contemporary art. Located in Kilmainham, Dublin, the Museum presents a wide variety of art in a changing programme of exhibitions, which regularly includes bodies of work from its own collection and its education and community department.",Date of experience: October 2018,Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA),4,"Dublin, Ireland"
Great tour to soak up Irish history!,"I couldn’t stop taking photos and reading up on the Vikings and Medieval history. The tour can last as long as you’d like as you get to go around at your own pace and view real artefacts dug up right in the heart of Dublin. You also get the choice (should you choose to dare) to climb the tower and view the centre of Dublin in all its glory! Fun for all ages and 100% worth a visit, whether you’re in it for the history, fun or even the views, you need to get yourself down to Dublinia!",Date of experience: October 2018,Dublinia,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
Stunning building,"Upon using the tour bus, we stumbled across St Patrick’s Cathedral. The building was beautiful to look at and although we didn’t stop, you can actually enjoy a visit inside the Cathedral (when not used for mass/a service) St Patrick's Cathedral founded in 1191, is the National Cathedral of the Church of Ireland. With its 43-metre (141 ft) spire, St. Patrick's is the tallest church (not Cathedral) in Ireland and the largest. If you’re a visitor to Ireland, be sure to feast your eyes on this beautiful building.",Date of experience: October 2018,Saint Patrick's Cathedral,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
Architecture in all its glory!,"Christ Church Cathedral is the cathedral of the diocese of Oxford, which consists of the counties of Oxford, Buckinghamshire and Berkshire.

Stunning to look at and definitely worth a visit!",Date of experience: October 2018,Christ Church Cathedral,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
Famous resident of St Andrew’s Church,"With St Andrew’s residing in the background, the Molly Malone statue holds a great piece of history within Dublin.

Jumping a 250ft freefall...we must be crazy!?!,"Me and the partner decided to travel from Warrington to give thrill seeking a go...only to stumble across a revamped steel facility! Zip lining, abseiling and then jumping 250ft like you would off a bridge is just insane!?! If you want to test someone’s bravery or if they aren’t scared of anything, try them on here and see if they sweat! Great day out and the science section seemed very popular for the kids. There’s also a lot of parking and a huge playground for kids!",Date of experience: September 2018,Magna Science Adventure Centre,4,"Rotherham, United Kingdom"
Wonderful day out (and night)!,"Me and the partner decided to choose the Vineyard out of a selection of activities through a voucher and we we loved it. Upon arriving we had a brewery tour first which is pretty much opposite the Vineyard where a gentleman gave us a good detailed explanation on how the beer is made here. We also got to try 4/5 different beers, each with their own unique taste and I have to say, all were great! Once travelling back over we were part of a huge group within a marquee where there owner Chris presented us with a glass of sparkling wine each and a talk on the history of how the Vineyard started. A glass of white, rose and a red wine in the making later, we were amazed at how much effort and dedication went in to building the business from such a humble gentleman. Once the tour was over, Chris knew we were camping at the Vineyard and ensured we had a taxi to get food and be returned at a suitable time. We had a great stay in our tent and loved waking up to a bright Vineyard! We purchased a rose (even though we are red wine fanatics) as it was fantastic and unfortunately no red was available. We also bought 6 bottle of ale for £16 (£3 each otherwise) which we took back with us as a souvenir. One of the nicest business owners I’ve met and a great visit - be sure to book as they accept weddings, parties and even funerals! Fantastic place!",Date of experience: September 2018,Yorkshire Heart Vineyard,4,"York, United Kingdom"
Lovely homely feel,"Me and the partner decided to visit The Bay Horse over the restaurant close-by as we were recommended it by a local of Green Hammerton - and we weren’t disappointed! Upon entering, it’s like travelling back in time to a proper pub, with lovely decor and a real fire! We were greeted by two young girls behind the bar and they explained we could sit anywhere to eat and asked what we would like to drink right off the bat - perfect service! We were recommended the curry as they are specially made by the chef so we both opted for a curry and it was beautiful. The chicken literally fell apart when eating. We had a dessert each too which was a fine finish to the meal and each had a Violet gin and lemonade to complete what was a fantastic night. If you’re anywhere remotely near The Bay Horse - get yourself there in a heartbeat!",Date of stay: September 2018,The Bay Horse Inn,4,"Green Hammerton, United Kingdom"
Great views and peaceful atmosphere!,"I was told by my family to visit on a nice day and I would enjoy myself. For the small admission price I found myself enjoying the walk around the gardens and desert very pleasing. I even managed to spot a road runner! Great to bring families and a good peaceful walk. If you find yourself in Arizona, I’d highly recommend visiting!",Date of experience: November 2017,Sonoran Desert National Monument,4,Arizona
Beautiful views and one off the bucket list!,"Yes it’s just a canyon and it’s big...but there’s so much more to it. You can grab a helicopter tour to land in the middle of the canyon, ride horseback through the canyon and even stay the night in a hotel at the canyon - or better yet, camp in the canyon! So glad I visited more than once and I was amazed by the views. Loved every minute and if you find yourself down in Arizona/Nevada, get yourself here! You won’t be disappointed!",Date of experience: November 2017,Grand Canyon South Rim,4,"Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona"
Amazing food <3!,"Family said on the way back from The Grand Canyon, we make our way through Arizona and eat at Haunted Hamburger. Before sitting down it was special as it contains its own merchandise shop! I was pretty spent being a tourist from the UK and I recall being gutted in not being able to purchase a really cool T-Shirt. The food and drink was immense! Reasonably priced and the staff were very friendly. Brilliant place to eat and if I’m back in Arizona soon, I’m coming back for my T-Shirt!!!",Date of visit: November 2017,Haunted Hamburger,4,"Jerome, Arizona"
Saved the best ‘til last?,"This was my final place to eat in The United States (was lunch before flying back the England) and my family had reminded me throughout my trip that they can’t wait to take me here. We arrived and was sat in a booth where a lovely waitress served us and once ordered glimpsed outside to a queue! Very popular and I would recommend getting there very early as the food was beautiful. They make the cookie dough fresh to order and that alone won me over! Fantastic place to eat with friends or family and the decor inside is brilliant! Staff deserve a huge thumbs up from me too as they were fantastic. If I’m ever in town soon, I’ll be back 100%!",Date of visit: November 2017,Oregano's Pizza Bistro,4,"Phoenix, Arizona"

Place to ourselves!,"A warm day in The Trafford Centre and we haven’t experienced Est Est Est before - why I don’t know! We opted to sit inside whilst everyone else was outside for some air conditioning and had the choice of anywhere to sit. It was nice and peaceful and felt like we had our own little dining experience. The cocktails and food was top notch and service we couldn’t fault. I can now understand why a lot of people choose to eat here when wanting Italian food. If you like Italian, give it a try, you won’t be disappointed!",Date of visit: May 2018,Est Est Est,4,"Trafford, United Kingdom"
Amazing for any Beatrix Potter fan!,"I’ve added a few photos taken from the day but I took over 100 along with videos for memories.

Great choice of ice cream to choose from!,"When wondering around Nice in the heat you’ll find loads of ice cream shops dotted around, but none come close to Fenocchio Glacier.

Great for kids and for that quick release of feeling like you’re melting!",Date of visit: May 2018,Fenocchio,4,"Nice, France"
Beautiful views of the Riviera!,Me and my partner visited through the main part of Nice (rather than walking up from the front along the Riviera) however I believe you can get a lift/elevator from the bottom which takes you up.

Another off the list!,"Me and the partner decided to stop off for a light refreshment at Hard Rock to tick another off the list around the World.

Magnifique!,"Me and the partner decided to find somewhere where a lot of locals would eat and visit and thanks to a bit of research, we stumbled across Di Piu. Firstly, I would recommend getting there early as it is always busy but the atmosphere and view out to sea is great! We opted to sit inside as it looked manic outside, plus it was warm so a little air conditioning was needed. We were sat opposite the pizza station where fresh pizzas were made every minute.

Beautiful building and high quality food!,"Upon landing in Dublin, it was around brunch time and we hadn’t had any breakfast so food was a must. We stumbled across Bewley’s, mostly because of the way the building looked from outside and decided here was where we would eat. Upon entering you can see all of the fresh cakes and pastries made to takeaway and before we knew it we were sat down and served by a friendly girl. Service was impeccable and the food matched the quality of the building and staff. I ordered a ham and cheese croissant and my partner a cinnamon bun.

The amount of different animals on show were great and they all looked like they were well taken care of. We even got to see baby Panda’s! Great day out for all parties and definitely worth a visit!,Date of experience: November 2017,San Diego Zoo,4,"San Diego, California"
Best online bookmaker there is!,Been using Bet365 for years now to place my football bets and my weekly Irish Lotto bets. Not been lucky lately but I always use the website as the football odds are better than most and the service is usually spot on.,Date of visit: June 2018,bet365,4,"Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom"
Mango cider is amazing!,"Me and my partner stumbled across Red Bank Cider at Bolton food festival only to find out it was on my partners door step! We visit regularly now to try new flavours. Personally I love the medium cider as it has the right balance of everything you could ask for in a cider however the last eat Mango cider is special. We love Red Bank and if you want a proper cider, get yourself down to taste before you buy. Amazing local business and we will be back soon!",Date of experience: June 2018,Red Bank Cider,4,"Bolton, United Kingdom"
Always love it here!,"I personally choose to fish on Holbar which hosts big carp and is a bit out the way but there’s plenty of pools on here that offer so much! You pay at the front first before setting off to your location and you won’t be disappointed, I fished on meat and pellet and although you catch the odd skimmer, the carp are beautiful and put up a great fight. I actually added a rarity into my fishing life by catching a freshwater mussel/clam. Unfortunately I can’t decide what it is however I was gobsmacked when I had seen it opened up to swallow my hook. One for the history books!",Date of experience: June 2018,Partridge Lakes Fishery,4,"Warrington, United Kingdom"
Favourite place in Manchester,"My partner surprised me with a birthday meal to our first date location at Gino’s and it was just as good as when we first visited. We decided to have a bottle of red wine to celebrate the occasion and share the same starter we had on our first date - Italian breadsticks wrapped in Parma ham, which is delicious. We both tried different main meals which were also very tasty and filling. As we had to get a dessert we went with pistachio ice cream to share which was a lovely ending to a fantastic meal. If you haven’t experienced Gino’s you’re missing out. The staff were very polite throughout the meal and are there for you if you need anything. Miles better dining experience than the more expensive San Carlo who can learn a thing or two about customer service skills. All in all, Gino’s is a fantastic little restaurant full of smiles, great tasting food and top customer service. Hopefully one day I’ll get to meet that man himself, share a bottle of red and thank him for a wonderful dining experience.",Date of visit: March 2018,Gino D'Acampo,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Iconic attraction!,"What is there to say...the World knows when it’s New Year in England when they hear the historic chimes of Big Ben ringing throughout the capital. When I was in high school, my bus took me past Big Ben twice a day and you can’t help but glance at the time. Now I live in Warrington, when visiting my friend I had to get a good skyline view of the building and I wasn’t disappointed. A shame people won’t hear it daily until 2021 but the repairs will be worth the wait. A definite must see if you’re visiting from a far away land.",Date of experience: September 2017,Big Ben,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Never been on however what a special landmark!,The London Eye - brilliantly lit up at night time where I’m sure you will see a fantastic view of London. Amazingly well choreographed firework display at New Year and since its introduction has become a worldwide attraction to see in a major city.,Date of experience: September 2017,London Eye,4,"London, United Kingdom"
The BEST place to get your donut fix!,"I visited America for the first time to see my family in Arizona and I must say, I love the place! Upon arriving in the evening, my Aunt and Uncle suggested I get breakfast from Lamar’s instead of having a Krispy Kreme (which is what we are used to over in the U.K.). Sceptical I drove the hire car to Lamar’s which was around a 5-10 minute drive and I knew straight away I was in for a treat as a queue had forced outside. It was 09:00!!! As I was visiting I had to get a mix to see what the fuss was about. Over in the U.K. you never get quality such as this and the staff were ever so patient and kind to me as they knew I wasn’t a local with my British accent! By far the best donuts I’ve ever tasted and although I was told to buy a Dunkin Donut and shake too (as seen in the photo), hands down Lamar’s has my vote!",Date of visit: October 2017,LaMar's Donuts and Coffee,4,"Phoenix, Arizona"
Double Double Down!?!,"I’m partial to a bit of KFC every now and then, especially when visiting my friends who live nearby. I suggested we have KFC as the Double Down burger was about to finish and I needed to be a part of the club, especially with it being the most popular KFC burger Worldwide! I decided to purchase two large meals that came with a side and hot wings along with a snack wrap and mini fillet burger. As you can see it took me a little longer than 15 minutes to eat it all but my goodness the food was yummy! KFC is KFC...it’s fast food but it was prepared quickly and the service was spot on. Great meal!",Date of visit: November 2017,KFC,4,"Warrington, United Kingdom"
Good quality food and service.,Visited with a couple of friends as recommended by a work colleague and we weren’t disappointed. The service was speedy and the food was good quality and fairly priced. Would definitely visit again.,Date of visit: September 2017,Nolita Cantina,4,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"
Amazing weekend!,Me and my partner decided we would go to our first festival together as a couple but decided against camping as we were due to fly to Rhodes the day after! We stayed in the Leeds City Centre where we found a shuttle bus that took fellow festival-goers to the front door and then back to Leeds once the acts were over. The acts were amazing all weekend and put on a cracking show not to mention the surprise guests Queens of the Stone Age performing! Unfortunately I don’t have many photos as I have tons of videos but I’d highly recommend Leeds as the music played is for everyone that enjoys music!,Date of experience: August 2017,Leeds Festival,4,"Wetherby, United Kingdom"
Valentines Drive-In,"My partner had a little surprise for me for Valentines and we ended up doing a little trip to The AJ Bell Stadium to watch Beauty and the Beast courtesy of Manchester iConic Drive-In Cinemas. The stadium is home to the Salford Red Devil’s Rugby League Team and can be viewed nicely by going over Barton Bridge. The stadium itself is nice, had plenty of outdoor complexes and also enough room to hold the drive-in cinema we went for. Great little stadium, just need to go on a match day now!",Date of experience: February 2018,AJ Bell Stadium,4,"Salford, United Kingdom"
Exceptional service and food,"I recently surprised my partner by starting the Saturday of her 30th weekend by having brunch at One 88. I had been emailing prior to the visit to which we were told we could have decorations up no problem and they would bring out a cake with lit candles and sing Happy Birthday and on top of that, prepare a bottle of Prosecco on ice for when we arrived. To be honest the only reason we ended up at One 88 was because it was recommended by friends and Slattery (opposite) was fully booked. However after the visit, One 88 is actually better by miles for breakfast and the service was brilliant. Food on offer is a lot nicer and very helpful. I’m very glad we ended up at One 88 and we would highly recommend visiting. We will be back soon! Thank you once again for all your help and professionalism.",Date of visit: February 2018,One 88 Kitchen & Bar,4,"Whitefield, United Kingdom"
Friendly staff and clean room,Had to book a late room for a Saturday night which the Travelodge was a good location as we wold be spending the night at San Carlo and the Northern Quarter. We normally book the Premier Inn nearby but it was fully booked. Upon arrival we were greeted by a lovely lady who gave us all the information we needed and provided us with our room keys. The room was exactly what you’d expect and there weren’t any issues whatsoever. The bed was comfy and we both slept well. Thank you for the relaxing morning sleep as we returned at 4am!,Date of stay: February 2018,Travelodge Manchester Central,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Great tasting British food with friendly staff.,"My partners family wanted to end the weekend birthday celebrations by having a family meal at a reputable place. Neither of us had been previously but were recommended to visit due to the lovely food on offer. The menu had a huge range of food to suit everybody’s needs and dietary requirements. Once ordered, starters were no longer than 10 minutes before they were on our table to which the Thai Fishcakes were amazing! For the main course I decided to try a more traditional dish of Steak and Ale pie and it was delicious! Finally I had to try the Baileys Cheesecake to end what was a 10/10 meal. The staff on that night were very friendly and professional. The restaurant caters to all ages and parties and I’d highly recommend the Swan & Cemetery. Will definitely be back soon.",Date of visit: February 2018,Swan & Cemetery,4,"Bury, United Kingdom"
Fantastic night of laughter!,"Me and my partner had both been previously but not together and decided during a Friday that we should have a nice date night together and spend it at the Frog and Bucket. We were unfortunate to turn up just after another couple who got the last seats available so we were told we would be standing, which wasn’t an issue. We asked politely if we could order food as we hadn’t eaten all day but to sit in a reserved place until the party arrived. This wasn’t a bother at all for the staff and they happily let us sit anywhere and ordered a very tasty pizza with fries on the side. As the place was filling up, I spoke with the manager and requested if any seats turn up to give us a shout. Before you know it, we were right next to the stage on a huge table as a hen party had not shown up! So it was a blessing missing the last table upon arrival as we had better seats to enjoy our night. The comedians themselves were great and put on a top show. The next time we will visit is on a Monday where Beat the Frog will be on!",Date of experience: February 2018,The Frog and Bucket Comedy Club,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Fantastic food but service wasn’t the best,"I’d booked a meal to celebrate a birthday for Saturday night as I’d been told San Carlo is a fantastic place to eat but to be wary of the service. Sceptical we turned up to and were sat down with no issues. The food is exceptional and nobody can fault the quality in the meals, the service was great up until the mains were finished with. Whether we were just forgotten about or a famous person had turned up, our finished plates remained on our tables for at least 45 minutes and then we couldn’t pay as we had to wait a further 30 minutes before anybody visited our table and then another 20 minutes for the chip and pin machine to arrive. Because of the timing, we lost our table at a cocktail bar but managed to save our night. I’d recommend visiting on a quieter night as you may get the service as well as the great food. It’s a real shame that the staff were a let down on the night for the second half of the meal.",Date of visit: February 2018,San Carlo,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Great for a film and a quick bite to eat/drink!,"My partner and I were treated by her parents to a movie night out (more like we gatecrashed their date night) to watch The Darkest Hour in The Light Cinema. We only wanted to get a large drink and was told that we were entitled to a free refill once we finished our original drink which is a great deal! The cinema itself had ridiculously comfy seats which felt just like sitting on sponges! The film experience was great and so was the film itself. Afterward (9pm) we decided to grab a quick bite to eat at Gourmet Burger Kitchen to which we were delivered fantastic service and very yummy food. They even allowed us to drink our refill from the cinema! All in all, a nice night out in a well kept environment. Will definitely be back soon!",Date of experience: February 2018,The Vaults,4,"Bolton, United Kingdom"
Great little place to eat.,"My partner recommended one day we visited The Pack Horse Inn as it’s a nice, cozy place to relax and eat tasty, hearty food. Once parked up, on a clear day you can enjoy the wonderful scenery the hills have to offer! Inside we were greeted by a lady that politely asked if we would like a table for two overlooking the marvellous view. Once sat down we were presented with the main and specials menus and asked if we would like a drink. I can see why some people would get annoyed as you’ve barely sat down but you can’t complain for what is speedy service can you? We had our drinks and before you knew it our meals which were made to perfection and tasted amazing. The food is very hearty and you definitely pay for the great quality food. The price is very reasonable for the level of service and quality of food you get, all looking over at the country. Great little place to visit and we will be back soon.",Date of visit: November 2017,The Pack Horse Inn,4,"Bury, United Kingdom"
Has everything you could possibly need under one roof!,"I’ve been to the Trafford Centre for a number of years now and you can understand why the place is busy every day of the week. Whether you and your partner, friends or even yourself wish to visit for whatever reason, there will always be a shop for you from department stores to a food court, luxury jewellery shops, top clothing brands, numerous restaurants and cafes, an arcade, a cinema, laser quest and mini golf, what more can you ask for under one roof? My trip was for Christmas to buy my partner some Pokemon teddies from Build-A-Bear. The quality of toys are superb and the level of service received was brilliant. A very well looked after establishment under a well maintained building. Definitely worth a visit if you are visiting Manchester or want to treat yourself to a shopping spree.",Date of experience: November 2017,The Trafford Centre,4,"Stretford, United Kingdom"
Speechless!,"Me and my partner decided to have a roam off the usual tourist dining areas and stumbled across this lovely little restaurant that also owned it’s own butchers opposite! We had turned up at the usual evening meal time where the owner allowed us to sit down whilst he found us a seat (family run so the staff were rushed off their feet but always smiling). We were asked whether we wanted to sit outside to which we replied “Sure” thinking nothing of it...only for the owner to pick a table up and two chairs and put them outside for us! Such a kind gesture. The service throughout was brilliant and we felt special from the word go knowing our table had been created outside to soak up the view of the local church. The food was authentic and tasted amazing! If you’re in Rhodes, scout for this restaurant as it was heaving (a party of 4 arrived a minute after us to be told they’d have to come back in an hour...which they did!) and an amazing experience. Locals also eat here which says enough!",Date of visit: September 2017,Niohori Restaurant,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Chocolate heaven!,"My partner and I stumbled across the chocolate cafe when we visited Ramsbottom for a day out and we’ve been back 3 times since! It’s a very small and cozy shop/cafe and serves some amazing chocolate! We decided on this visit if we were lucky enough to grab a bite to eat as the cafe was full on our previous visits with guests queuing to be seated and we can see why! The hot chocolates are amazing and made to your liking, the caramel chocolate buttons are a million times better than Cadbury and the normal menu items (that aren’t chocolate) tasted great too! The shop always has offers such as 3 for £10 on bars which isn’t expensive as you’re definitely paying for the quality. All in all, chocolate lovers need to get down to The Chocolate Cafe and see what Chocolate Heaven really tastes like!",Date of visit: November 2017,Chocolate Cafe,4,"Ramsbottom, United Kingdom"
Fantastic day out!,"My partner had never been to Chester Zoo but she loves animals, so I decided to treat her to what I believe is the best in the country. Chester Zoo has recently extended its car park to fit even more visitors in which definitely was needed as we struggled to find space anywhere near the entrance! Over the years the Zoo has continuously grown and the animals are really cared for. We had to visit our favourite Red Pandas and they didn’t disappoint running around the place without a card in the world. The range of animals for you to see is staggering and you can tell just by looking at the animals that they are treated well. There’s plenty to explore and we even entered my favourite which is the Bat Cave which makes you feel like Batman when bats are swooping past your head and you can feel the breeze! The admission is a very fair price for what you see and I’d highly recommend Chester Zoo for all ages and groups!",Date of experience: July 2017,Chester Zoo,4,"Chester, United Kingdom"
