Weekend stay at the Hallmark Carlton,"A pleasant stay at the Hallmark Carlton. My family and I thought it fun to pop down to Bournemouth for the day and night. The hotel location was good, a 10 min stroll or so to the pier. We visited the Aquarium which was great and then headed into town. The hotel room was very spacious. The decor at the hotel was good, traditional British hotel so had a nice atmosphere. The staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was very good in the morning.

Day fishing trip,"What an amazing family day out. So relaxed on the boat with Captain Gerasimos and Maria. We saw turtles, explored the bay and were lucky enough to see a pod of dolphins too. The captain showed us how the local fishermen fish with nets and explained all the different fish he caught. The trip was brilliant, afterwards we went to White Rock beach for some snorkelling. Then headed over to Rabbit island for a lovely lunch and drinks prepared by the Captain and Maria using the caught fish (parrot fish, red mullet, cuttlefish and shrimps). An excellent day out, learnt lots about net fishing and the area. The kids (12 & 10) had a fab time too, can highly recommend going. Really good value for money. Thank you for all the memories!",Date of experience: August 2019,Poseidon Fishing Tourism Kefalonia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
