Amazing day fishing,"Had an amazing day fishing ( 27/8/19) with George and his crew , the boat can take 12 passengers but we decided to hire it privately as we were a party of 7 . We all had a go at putting the nets out about 1500 metres , then over to a private island for a swim to shore , drinks in Porta Roma which is beautiful. Kids had a go on a speedboat inflatable ride which they loved! Then lunch on board the boat which was delicious, best day of our holiday, only Georgios has the licence to do this type of trip , was brilliant day! Thanks Georgios",Date of experience: August 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Weekend stay with family,"We have been staying at the palm court for many many years now and always find it excellent. The staff are very friendly and attentive, the food just gets better every year.

Friday night meal with family,"Visited last night , weâ€™ve been on a few occasions now and was excellent as always a really warm and friendly place to eat and drink. Starters were very tasty, scotch egg nice and runny in the middle. My 12 year old likes his steak medium rare and so many places over cook it , particularly for a child requesting this but last night was cooked to perfection. Apple tart and the brownie were polished off as well. All in all very good indeed.",Date of visit: November 2018,The Marcia Inn,4,"Bishopthorpe, United Kingdom"
