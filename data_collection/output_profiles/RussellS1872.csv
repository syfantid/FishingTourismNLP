Fantastic meal and service,Thank you for a wonderful evening as always. Our curry club evenings would not be the same anywhere else. Thank you Juba and your team for excellent service.,Date of visit: July 2019,The Famous Curry Bazaar,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Wonderful fishing trip with Efi and Dimitrious,"Absolutely brilliant day out. Dimitrios and Efi are the most caring and friendly hosts. They take you out to gather the catch from the nets and you get to help extract the fish from the nets if you want to. The fish, including squid and scorpion fish, are then cooked up for one of the best meals you will have in Kefalonia. You get a couple of opportunities to swim in the crystal blue waters and they provide a selection of beer, home made wine and soft drinks. I highly recommend this day out.",Date of experience: July 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"

You must go!,"If you are in DC you must make time to visit the National Air and Space museum. So much to see and learn about. The space related exhibits were the highlight. Seeing the lunar module, walking through the space station and reading about all the astronauts was fascinating. Also don't miss the planetarium with Neil de Grasse Tyson narrating The Dark Universe. So cool.",Date of experience: September 2016,National Air and Space Museum,4,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"
