A lovely family run restaurant,"We came here for lunch one day and then came back again for dinner and then back again for lunch .

A friendly, clean family restaurant with the best Adana kebabs and great service, all at a great price. Would highly recommend",Date of visit: September 2020,Adana Kebap Restaurant,4,"Kas, Turkey"
Awesome!,"Can’t go wrong...want to stop for a drink, no problem, some snacks, no problem, full dinner, yes of course!

Team - led by Ferrat - will always make you welcome. Great hospitality, great food, great service...at a price that doesn’t hurt .

Good food, good wine, comfortable seating, great service, cold beer...what more could you ask for?",Date of visit: September 2020,Cinarlar Pizza Pide Grill & Sea Food Garden,4,"Kas, Turkey"
Great food...but,"A nice, cosy Turkish restaurant with great food. It just didn’t seem as welcoming as it could have been.

No-one asked us once how the food was, we weren’t offered the desert menu after our mains and when we left the manager wasn’t around, so the waitresses were happily chatting in the corner looking at their mobile phones and didn’t acknowledge us leaving at all. Perhaps it was because it wasn’t very busy they felt they could socialise between themselves but it was disappointing.

It may have been a one off and this score could so easily have been a five, so we will go back there again.",Date of visit: September 2020,The Mezze,4,"Bognor Regis, United Kingdom"
Adequate,"Checked in for one night, reasonable price for a basic room overlooking the back road rather than the lake out the front. Air con poor. Room was clean but bed not that comfortable. Adequate for one night.",Date of stay: December 2019,Premier Inn Ashington hotel,4,"Ashington, United Kingdom"
Great Food!,"We tipped up with no notice and ordered for our group of 8. It was a quiet afternoon so perhaps we were lucky.
Food order consisted of sausage and chips, fish and chips, pizza and various kebabs. Also had a good chat with the owner whist we were waiting.
There was more than enough for everyone, it was all freshly cooked and everyone enjoyed it.
Can’t really fault it and we will be back!",Date of visit: November 2019,The Sussex Fryer,4,"Bognor Regis, United Kingdom"
Intimacy at it’s Best!,"We are really fortunate to have visited Taj Lake Palace previously, on this occasion we stayed for three nights and with such good (if a little late) monsoon rains the palace looked the best we have ever seen.

Our welcome in the evening from the Duty Manager (Dipankar) and the team was so warm and friendly it was like coming home!

This hotel is so beautifully maintained, with wonderful furnishings. It is close and intimate and yet there is room to find piece and quiet whenever you want to.

As our whole India trip turned out to be a bit of a ‘last minute’ visit the front office Manager, Mr Rahul Mehta tasked his team with helping us to sort out our transportation and accommodation for the rest of our trip to India, which was accomplished with ease and a smile.

We tended to have a quick drink in the bar and then eat in Jharokha and gaze out across the lake, always having excellent food and well looked after by Mr Dili Nair and his team including Raag and others who couldn’t do enough for us.

We had a couples spar which was one of the most relaxing treatments we have ever had and we had the most astonishing room.

Finally, to look after us, our butler Prem who is one of the stars of Palace. We have known him since meeting him here on our honeymoon and the trip would not have been the same had we not met up with him again.

If ever there was a time to give a hotel 6 stars out of five it would be now!

Our plan is to return in a couple of years time...how could we not?",Date of stay: September 2019,Taj Lake Palace Udaipur,4,"Udaipur, India"
A Brief but Enjoyable Stay,"We have been to Goa before and we tend to stay with Taj Hotels in other parts of India.

Although we usually stay at small hotels we booked Taj Fort Aguada in a bit of a rush.

When we arrived we were treated with typical Taj hospitality and welcomed with open arms and some lovely treats in the room.

We realised quite quickly that the hotel was too large for us and quite busy with families celebrating the end of the monsoon season (though due to its size in no way overcrowded).

Had we done our homework we would have also known that Northern Goa is significantly different from the south and also the spa is out of the main hotel (though not far) and the Thai restaurant is in the adjacent Taj (Holiday Village).

None of these are show stoppers in any way and you still get the same level of service that you would expect from a Taj.

It was not for us however so we made the decision to move on.

The staff were really quite sad and made literally every effort to make things better for us but with the combination of things it just wasn’t what we wanted.

This makes for quite a difficult review to write but I think it’s important to write.

Would I recommend it, yes. Was it for us, no - but it will be for many people reading this as the spa treatment we had was great, the food was good and the staff were very friendly and couldn’t do enough for us.

P.s if in doubt as to where to go, just go to the front desk and ask for Trivago :-)",Date of stay: September 2019,"Taj Fort Aguada Resort & Spa, Goa",4,"Sinquerim, India"
Great Place,"Initially we went here for lunch (I can highly recommend the stuffed pepper and tomato!). Ended up going for dinner...and then dinner again...and then lunch on our last day.

Lovely Greek family and staff, very friendly and helpful.

Great tasting good value Greek food (usually cooked by Mamma).

Would recommend a visit!",Date of visit: June 2019,Dum Spiros Spero Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic Day Out!,"We went for a day cruise. From the moment we set off we had great fun!

Antonia is a great host and together with Michalis and his right hand man Hassan you honestly could not wish for a better day.

This is not a boat full of tourists getting sunburnt and singing, this is being with a real fisherman, family and friends, enjoying a great day out, with GREAT food, good wine and good company.

Honestly, highly recommended!

Thank you",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Excellent Lunch!,"We like to take Mum out to lunch or dinner at different places when we visit her and this was our first trip to La Torre. Very quiet on a freezing cold windy day in December so we had our pick of where we wanted to sit. Friendly polite staff, great Calzone and Lasagne, great service. We will be back!",Date of visit: December 2018,La Torre,4,"Bedlington, United Kingdom"
Lovely place to stop off,"We came across this lovely place by accident and it was clear they had had a very busy Sunday, but that didn’t stop them from giving us a really warm and friendly welcome.
Only stopped for one quick drink (they had such a good lunch time they had pretty much ran out of all food), but it was so nice one drink turned into two and could have very easily turned into three!
Great staff and a few great locals, next time we’re in town we will definitely visit.",Date of visit: July 2018,Il-Baxa Cafe Bar,4,"Island of Malta, Malta"
What more could you want,"Came across the Adelphi by accident. Great staff, great food (no, really great food! - I had the beef stroganoff and my wife had a pizza) great atmosphere, really clean.

What more could you want?",Date of visit: July 2018,Adelphi Restaurant,4,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Simply Wonderful,"We are fortunate to have stayed at this breathtaking palace several times. Each time has been so wonderful we always leave knowing that we will have to go back! This time we understand that Trip Advisor Travellers Choice Awards 2016 has been awarded to Umaid Bhawan Palace as the best hotel in the world...no surprise to those of us who are lucky enough to have visited!

From the moment you are warmly welcomed to the moment you leave, you are treated as royalty. I mention how good the Rajisthani breakfast was and I'm given an impromptu tour of the kitchens and a cooking class. We turn up on my Birthday (late, thank you Air India!) and the celebration makes this the best Birthday I've had - not only due to Mr Swaroop and Mr Jitendra, who are outstanding, but to all of the staff. We experience a couples spa treatment and it is so good we go back and have another!

The decor is striking and the rooms are furnished beautifully. You pay a lot to stay here but you get back far more than what you pay for.",Date of stay: June 2016,Umaid Bhawan Palace Jodhpur,4,"Jodhpur, India"
