The best way to view Polyaigos,"The trip with with the boat was awesome. We made the tour around Polyaigos and visited the best parts of the island. The waters were so clear, i could see the bottom. We swam with the fish and saw sea turtles. We saw caves and beaches i have never seen on another island.
The captain, Andreas was kind, funny and a great cook. He served us traditional delicacies and the best fish soup I have ever eaten. The meal was served onboard in a breath tanking cove at the southern part of Polyaigos. The whole experience was amazing. I will definitely take the tour again.",Date of experience: August 2020,Boat Trips-VIP/Family daily cruises in Milos,5,"Kimolos, Greece"
