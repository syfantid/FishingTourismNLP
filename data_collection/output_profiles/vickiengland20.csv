Authentic Greek Cuisine,"We visited for lunch and were really impressed with the hospitality and the uncomplicated traditional Greek menu. The food was delicious and the prices very reasonable.

Brilliant Day Out,"We had a fantastic afternoon fishing on this very well organised trip with a really personal feel. The guys were good fun, knowledgeable and seemed to really enjoy hosting us. They were always on hand to help us and ensured we didn’t catch any unwanted fish ... e.g. the dragon fish. The lunch was superb ... all cooked on board on a little BBQ. Would highly recommend for the experienced or non-experienced as it’s not too serious.",Date of experience: September 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Superb Service,"We had the pleasure of Matthew as our driver, who is a very knowledgeable young man and made our trip highly enjoyable. It was a warm morning and Matthew was quick to present us with refreshments upon arrival at our pick up location. Look forward to booking our next excursion and hope Matthew will be assigned to our party once again.

The scotch egg starter was delicious, and the duck supper and sticky pork belly were superb.

Staff and customers all had a smile on their face which made for a great atmosphere.

Half day reef fishibg,"This was an absolute must on our holiday activity list and it didn’t disappoint.

There were 7 of us on the boat, and two crew. The captain took care to pick a spot where there lots of fish, which meant between the two of us we caught 13 fish - red and black sea bream and mackerel.

Unfortunately 4 out of the 7 were severely sea sick and couldn’t fish ... so it’s perhaps not for those who have a weak stomach!

Would highly recommend.",,Half-Day Reef Fishing from Vilamoura,4,"Vilamoura, Portugal"
Couples bike rental,"We hired two bikes for 4 hours, and cycled from Vilamoura to Olhos de Água. The bikes were great and the staff were friendly and helpful. The price was very reasonable too... €10 each for the 4 hours and we didn’t have to give a deposit. Great activity for couples and groups.",Date of experience: May 2018,"Bike A Wish, Bike Rental & Tours",4,"Vilamoura, Portugal"
