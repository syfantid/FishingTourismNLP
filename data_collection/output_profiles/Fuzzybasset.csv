A great way to mix it up from the typical catamaran,"We wanted to get in some fishing while on Santorini. The typical “fishing charter” is not really available here, but we are so happy we found Athina, Marcos, and Mohammed! We had a great evening of food, fishing, and learning about the local fisheries. The food they prepared was tasty and Athina is so knowledgeable. The boat was not overcrowded and it was perfect as we weren’t looking for the party not atmosphere of the catamarans. I would highly recommend this boat trip for families, couples, or individuals who want to spend some time on the water in Greece.",Date of experience: October 2019,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Unique and welcoming!,"Paola and George are such welcoming hosts and this experience is so unique in Santorini! We love taking cooking classes back home and our experience at Petra Kouzina was better than any we’ve experienced before. The space is modern and quite “Instagramable”. The class itself is a great pace and George did an excellent job catering to beginners and more experienced cooks. We loved his tips and family stories. This is a great day for couples, families, or individuals who are looking for a break from the sun and long lines at the usual tourist traps.",Date of experience: October 2019,Petra Kouzina Cooking Experience,5,"Santorini, Greece"
