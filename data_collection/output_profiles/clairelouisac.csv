Highs and lOWS,"Great size room, great location, everything is with in walking and overall a perfect place.
However please do be careful. They require a Â£50 deposit each (per person) However if your with a large party all your deposits are collected together as one with one signature for all the money even though there are multiple rooms.

This meant that when it came to checking out and getting the deposit back even if someone else in your party who was not in your room has caused any damages that charge will still be taken from your collective kitty. So next time I will make sure we keep our deposits separate.

Our party realised this upon check out as they wanted to take money for a chair that was damaged. we knew exactly what chair it was and we 100% caused no damaged it was like that upon arrival so when you check in any problems with your apartment report it right away!

Other than that, clean, good size and handy location",Date of stay: June 2018,Playamar Apartments,4,"Benidorm, Spain"

By far one of the best week stays I have ever had!,"Firstly I must say one of the best weeks away Ive had! It was so perfect we rarely even left the diggs.

When it came to booking myself and my partner were looking for a good fishing lake with good accommodation.

After spending hours looking through websites we found Tally Ho 1.

When booking it was so simple and easy. Donna, (the owner) was so thoughtful and helpful ensuring we had everything we need for our stay.

When arriving on the site I could not believe how modern, beautiful and fun the site was. There is plenty to do there and the staff were great.

Once we arrived at Tally ho 1 the only thing I can say is it blew my mind. Super clean, beautiful deco, lots of information inside incase were looking for things to do in the area. Tally ho was perfect. Everything we needed for cooking was there, games, dvd, tvs, and the accommodation was really 5 star. I could not think of booking anywhere better.

The local takeaways were really good to!

The hot tub was easy to use and it really made our trip extra special as its just the best view of the lake with the sun going down.

Donna was also only a call away if we needed anything.
As Donna knew it was my partners birthday she had very kindly decorated the home with balloons and a great welcome pack!

As for the fishing there are plenty of beautiful pike weighting around 24 pound so we were more than happy there and all year round this place can produce some stunning fish.

So if you are looking for a break this is the one, I really can't recommend it enough
We will be re booking very soon",Date of stay: January 2018,Tally Ho 1 Luxury let prime lakeside location with hot tub and private fishing,4,"Tattershall, United Kingdom"
great summer day out,"I loved it, so many activities and things to see and do, fun for all ages.
The lady on the ticket box, Christina was so helpful in giving me all the information and she really got us excited and in the mood for a fantastic day by telling us about the shows, times and whats best to see.

As always the actors were helpful and quick witted. Having the chance to have pictures with them was great and will be a keep sake for our family day,

Well done to all including the staff dealing with the busyness for the big shows.

best part of our holiday,"wow I was blown away by Makarounas fishing trip. Me and my partner are regular fishers so to fish on holiday was something we were looking forward to.
There are lots of boats and trips in different price ranges to choose from, especially during the busy season. However Makarounas fishing trip was fantastic, by far the best experience of our holiday and if you are going to choose a boat while in Greece this is the one!

The ride began with a beautiful sight seeing adventure then it was time to fish. Our captain let us fish different areas and taught us all about different types of fish and how the sea work. After a few hours of fishing we had the most beautiful BBQ on the boat. All the fish we had was freshly seasoned, grilled to perfection, and along with that came a beautiful salad and fresh baked bread. The food was full of flavour. The best meal I had all week.

To end the trip a chance to go swimming in the beautiful sea.

Overall the trip offered great fishing, beautiful food, hot and cold drinks, your choice of music, swimming in a warm sea. But most of all the atmosphere on the boat was relaxing fun and the captain could not have been more helpful and welcoming, he made you feel that we had been friends for years.

If your looking for a boat trip this is the one. It truly was a perfect day for me and my partner and we walked away on such a high",Date of experience: October 2016,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"

Stratford upon Avon gem! !,"Great day out for the family and those with a passion for history. there's been a lot of money and time put into the museum and it really shows.
It combines the historic Information and more fun activities for children.

The museum has replica rooms, foods, and even clothing to try on. It's very interactive which I loved. There was short films, clothes to try, colouring for the kids, my niece was entranced for the whole thing.

There's also a good choice of other events there, ghost tours, pub tours, and learning workshops

I'd defiantly have to say this place is a hidden gem in Stratford upon Avon and it's worth visiting",Date of experience: June 2015,Tudor World,4,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom"
