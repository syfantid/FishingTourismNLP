I Would highly recommend it to everyone of all ages. From the minute you step on board the superb experience begins........  The hosts are very welcoming and professional; this is also an opportunity to learn a new skill and more about Samos sea life.  The delicious lunch, local wine, glorious scenery and views and the occasional sighting of dolphins all add to this amazing day out.  Diolch yn fawr (thank you very much) we will see you next year.  John and Sian"

3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philippehelmbaek,August 2020,5,Exceptional daytrip,"Yiannis and Nancy are the sweetest people on earth, and make you feel at home instantly when you arrive at their boat. The trip is amazing where you have time to learn and fish, and get the experience to eat delicious fresh fish after 1 hour. Nancy’s cooking is incredible, and will never forget “Nancy’s spagetthi”. The trip is for everyone and an awesome environment to swim in beautiful places and see the island from the sea. You’ll get a fun day with some lovely warm people, and definetely a trip you will remember for the rest of your life.If you are on Samos, you HAVE to go on this trip."

The fishing was a great experience, the lunch was outstanding. Your kindness and enthousiasm is appreciated in many ways. We will meet again. To others: I would recommend this trip to everyone..."

3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petrabI6201XL,August 2020,5,Fantastic and amazing fishing trip,"What an amazing day i had yesterday with this lovely couple Giannis and Nansy.  So good organized, beautiful and delicious food, super cold drinks, we had a fantastic group of people and you visit the most beautiful bay's of Samos. I will make the trip again."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gaelle123A,July 2020,5,Amazing day trip,"I booked this excursion as a surprise for my husband and father. They had the most amazing day! We dropped them off just before 9AM and picked them up around 7PM. When we picked them up they couldn’t stop talking about how awesome everything was. They were super happy with what they caught and couldn’t stop commenting on how friendly and accommodating Nancy and Yanis had been, and Nancy’s is worthy of Michelin stat chefs :) They also went out to swim in a little bay with the most beautiful shades of blue they had ever seen. They went with a group of nine, mixed ages, nationalities, men and women and everyone seemed to have had a blast. They also caught so much fish we got to take some home for the next day. Don’t doubt it, you’ll have a great day out! We’ll be back and next time mum and I will join the fishing party:)"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fittiworld,September 2019,5,Simply the best....,"Amazing boat trip with Yiannis and Nancy on honeymoon holiday. What an experience, 10 of us started and by the end of the day we were all friends. Yiannis had so much time for everyone and Nancy’s cooking was first class. Everybody caught fish and they were all prepared and cooked on board and enjoyed by all.The 440hp engine gets you there very fast so had lots more time fishing and swimming in beautiful location than other trips I have tried.I can not recommend these lovely people highly enough, so go ahead and treat yourself to this trip.Can’t wait for next years trip but I fear booking will be required..."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsandmisterH,September 2019,5,Fishing trip with Yiannis and Nancy,"We can fully recommend a day fishing with Yiannis and Nancy. What a lovely couple who makes you feel at home on board on their fishing boat. It’s fun, learning and enjoyable. The food was so tasty and of course the fish was so fresh while we had just pulled them out of the water."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mexter,September 2019,5,Samos Fishing Trips - a great experience,"My boyfriend and i went on this trip and both of us had a wonderful day. We took off in the morning, stopped to fish for a couple of hours and after catching plenty of fish we went to a beautiful area to swim, relax and have lunch together.  I had no previous experience of fishing but that wasn’t a problem at all. The kind hosts taught me everything I needed to know and I felt well taken care of. The lunch, including the fish that we caught earlier, was so delicious! And it really felt like hanging out with good friends, all thanks to the warm and friendly hosts who made everyone feel comfortable and happy. So, I recommend to go on this trip if you wanna have a fun and relaxed day on the sea, meet some new friends and experience the greek hospitality at its best. Thank you Nancy and Giannis!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/217iinam,August 2019,5,A perfect experience,"The trip felt like visiting local friends from start to finish! We booked the trip because we wanted a bit more private experience, and the 10 people trip was exactly what we were looking for. When we went to book the trip and met Giannis and Nancy we already knew it will be awesome, and the day itself could not have been better. From the start Giannis told us to make ourselves at home and think the of boat as our own. We saw dolphins, caught a lot of fish and calamari too, Nancy cooked them for us (food was perfect!) and we got to swim and drink and laugh the whole day. Thank you so much!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoSayer72,August 2019,5,Best Boat Trip EVER,"We have been on several boat trips over the years (lazy days at sea) but never a fishing trip and this trip beats all the rest by far. My husband and I went on this trip with our 7 year old son and although none of us have fished before, we caught around 20 fish between the 3 of us. This is not a trip with lots of people, there were only 8 of us in total, and Giannis, Nancy and their daughter Areti took care of everyone and made it such an amazing day. Giannis taught us how to fish and Nancy is the most phenomenal cook, (the shrimp spaghetti is to die for), and they are the most genuine and lovely family you could wish to meet.  Giannis also taught the boys (there was also another boy of around 12 years old) how to clean and gut the fish. There was beer and soft drinks that you could help yourself to and excellent wine with lunch. We stopped at a beautiful bay to swim where the water is crystal clear and that is only used by a few locals as it is only reached by boat or by a hike down the mountain, so there were only around 10 other people around. This is by far the best trip you will find in Samos with the most beautiful people who genuinely love the company of their guests and who soon turn into friends. All the best with your business and keep in touch. xxx "
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pkasslb,August 2019,5,GREEK HOSPITALITY AT ITS FINEST! ,"This is a MUST do when visiting Samos! Giannis and Nancy along with their daughter Areti provide an experience found nowhere else in Samos! Their expertise in my mind is not the fishing but the hosting and cooking. The fishing was phenomenal but had we caught no fish at all would not have mattered. This beautiful family is what made our day. They are genuinely good people and Nancy is a PHENOMENAL cook! The greek feast she prepared for us at sea was amazing! The seafood pasta was to die for! The day was split up between fishing,swimming, drinking greek beer and feasting on greek food and wine....lots of it! We stopped at a beautiful beach that is frequented by locals and only reachable by boat or 850m hike down a mountainside. One word breathtaking. My family is from Samos and this felt like a family get together rather than an excursion. I can't thank them enough for making our family feel like part of theirs! Efharisto Poli, méchri na synantithoúme xaná! "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L5064XRsimonea,August 2019,5,The best day of our holiday by miles!,"This was such a special day out for us with Giannis and Nancy and their lovely daughter on their fab fishing boat. Just a nice small group of us spent the day out in the water - they were so friendly and helpful - we all caught fish including our 11 year old son who was so excited to then help clean the fish and eat the freshest of lunches with fish that he caught himself! We stopped at a beautiful hidden bay to swim, where the water was bluest I have ever seen.Nancy cooked an incredible lunch for everyone, with delicious wine too.I would say that this trip is a must do if you visit Samos."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bigbas1967,August 2019,5,Fishing trip,"Great day we had. Giannis and his lovely wife Nancy and daughter made it a special day. Fishing, swimming and eating the fish with very tastefull spaghetti and salade. Enjoyed it very much. Great trip for familys and with friends..Giannis, 10 out of 10 if that could be possible..greetings, Big Bas and small Bas"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiiraAndMikko,August 2019,5,A day like a dream,Genuine greek hospitality by Nancy and Giannis. Come as a guest leave as a friend is once again true:) It was exciting to try fishing guided by professionals. The stop for swimming in the turquoise water and eating the catch of the day together with our new friends was amazing. Time was flying with no hurry from 9 to 5 so fast. Thank you once again and good luck with your business - the perfect and needed skills you have. Hope to meet you again!
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janaU3141VG,August 2019,5,Great Day on the Boat,"We had a great day fishing with the captain Jannis and his wife Nancy. Not only we caught a lot of fish and calamari, also the whole day felt really familiar. After a short ride from Pythagorio habour we started fishing right away. Then we went to a really nice beach with epic blue water. After a dip in the water it we ate the catch from the day directly on the boat a box with cold beverages is also on the boat and for free. All together is was an amazing day. "
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karin_m_P,July 2019,5,Brilliant experience!,"We can highly recommend Samos fishing trips which was the highlight of our vacation this year. We went on this tour with our three sons aged 3, 9 and 11 and they enjoyed the day as much as we did.Yanis and Nancy are absolutely brilliant in making sure that everybody onboard the boat is having a great time. Yanis taught our sons how to clean the fish and they where thrilled over the calamaries that he caught. After fishing we went to the most beautiful place to swim and relax while Nancy cooked the most wonderful dinner that we ate on the boat.  Many thanks Yanis and Nancy! We regret that we did not have the opportunity to visit you again in the harbor for a drink together . Next time in Samos we will for sure go on a trip again!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/faulknerelectrical,July 2019,5,Best Day Ever,"We had the most amazing day from start to finish. I have been on many boat trips and this was by far the best ever. We caught over 60 fish between us, my 6 year old daughter even caught 8 fish, it was amazing to see the joy on her face. My 10 year old daughter caught the biggest fish. Nancy and Yanis made us feel so welcome, Nancy cooked the fish and prepared a beautiful Greek salad with lovely bread and home grown olives, and not forgetting the lovely Samos wine. What an amazing day with my family, the memories we will cherish forever. Thank you so much Nancy and Yanis, Yamas "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/895lexv,July 2019,5,Great day out on the sea!,"We were guests in the first week they started their new venture. Giannis and Nansy are superb hosts and born with the hospitality x-factor. €60 pp is nothing for a great day out, with fishing, drinking, eating (fresh fish and salats etc), cruising. A must-do in Pythagorion."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Denpbr,July 2019,5,An unforgettable day at sea,"This trip is a perfect opportunity to enjoy Samos at its best. The hosts, Giannis and Nancy are very helpful, knowledgeable, and have a passion for what they do. They know the waters and will provide bait and equipment suited for a great fishing experience. They are also helpful in teaching different fishing techniques and can tell a lot about the waters. Nancy is also a great cook, and will make a really nice meal from minute-fresh ingredients. Deep blue water, a bent fishing rod and the  lovely people will definitely make it a day to remember."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RotemTouitou,July 2019,5,Best Fishing trip ever!!,"This was such an amazing day!! More thanks to Yanis and Nancy who are the owners of the boat and the first ones to offer a fishing trip in Samos than anything else ️ They gave us a feeling it was our own boat since the moment we met. All day long they make sure you are having fun, taking you on the boat to the best fishing spots and teaching you how to fish if needed. We were lucky to catch many of them. All of us. When fishing was over we parked at the most amazing Bay with water so clear I was sure you only get to see in the Bahamas  some jumped in and I was happy Yanis let me help him clean the fish :) We talked and made jokes all day, cooked the amazing fish we caught wish some fresh bread salad and white wine and couldn’t be happier on our way back. We made new friends and had such a good experience I would go a million times more !"
