The best day of our holiday by miles!,"This was such a special day out for us with Giannis and Nancy and their lovely daughter on their fab fishing boat. Just a nice small group of us spent the day out in the water - they were so friendly and helpful - we all caught fish including our 11 year old son who was so excited to then help clean the fish and eat the freshest of lunches with fish that he caught himself! We stopped at a beautiful hidden bay to swim, where the water was bluest I have ever seen.
Nancy cooked an incredible lunch for everyone, with delicious wine too.
I would say that this trip is a must do if you visit Samos.",Date of experience: August 2019,Samos Fishing Trips,5,"Samos, Greece"
Perfect Birthday Celebration,"I am always hesitant to recommend a restaurant to a large group of friends, but I needn't have worried! There were 10 of us celebrating a friend's birthday on a buzzing Saturday evening, and all from out of town except for myself - miraculously, everyone agreed that it was the perfect choice.

We all enjoyed excellent service, divine food and exquisite presentation.

The last time I ate here was quite a few years ago, before the new location and set menu, but it was as good, if not better than I remembered and I can't wait to return!",Date of visit: April 2017,Indian Summer,5,"Brighton, United Kingdom"
Great stamp shop,"Such a lovely shop - amazing collection of stamps, prices start really low, so great for kids wanting to start collecting. The owner was very polite and helpful. Good tip - they sell a fab range of interesting 1st class stamps for 45p (20p less than the Post Office and much nicer).",Date of experience: September 2016,Gustamps,5,"Brighton, United Kingdom"
