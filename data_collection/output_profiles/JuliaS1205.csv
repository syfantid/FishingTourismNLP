Fantastic experience,"We loved spending the day on the Sea around Santorini with Anthi and her crew. Everyone was friendly and professional from booking, questions beforehand, and during the excursion. The team made sure we had the best of scenery and food. A great trip.",Date of experience: May 2019,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Bad Experience,"We arrived and found our reservation for two of our three rooms had been cancelled ""accidently"" even though I had called to confirm the week prior. Regardless of the fact that both front desk employees said it was the hotel's mistake, the manager seemed unwilling to assist us. We finally were accommodated. Upon checkout, I was given my statement of charges, which I reviewed with the desk, and confirmed the zero balance. However, when I looked online a few days later, my credit card had been charged twice the amount on my statement. I called the manager who told me he couldn't just ""credit my account"" and referred me to MasterCard saying they were the ones who made the mistake. Hours of phone calls later, MC did handle this for me. This trip and the associated problems could have salvaged if it weren't for the rude, arrogant manager. Steer clear and go to the Embassy Suites down the street.",Date of stay: September 2013,Holiday Inn & Suites Rogers - Pinnacle Hills,4,"Rogers, Arkansas"
"Great service, good price, friendly staff..in Midtown? - unbelievable!","Although my daughter is in college in NYC, I rarely visit because of the high prices and unfriendly service at most hotels and restaurants. At the recommendation of a friend, I stayed at the Hotel Elysee with my family for several days during late summer. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and the club floor is available to all guests with food, drinks, etc. offered during much of the day. On the day of our departure, we had purchased a few food and drink items from a nearby grocery store and had them packed in a cooler to take on the road with us. When the doorman saw us, he went into the hotel and brought back a bunch of crushed ice from the hotel kitchen and put it in the cooler for us. We were just amazed. I called this evening to make reservations for May and the gentleman I spoke with went out of his way to find me a lower rate and to provide friendly feedback and service. This is the way to win customers and keep them!",Date of stay: August 2008,Hotel Elysee by Library Hotel Collection,4,"New York City, New York"
One of my worst NYC experiences,"I have to admit, I did not chose The Belvedere. I was attending a class that was taking place in the hotel and the organizers suggested staying there. From the first moments, I was just...concerned. The elevator seemed to be 200 years old. Everything -- rooms, elevator, hallways -- was dark. The hallway on our floor was so narrow and dark I would have thought I was on an inexpensive cruise ship and not a hotel. Because we were attending a class, we needed a chair and desk to do work in the evening...but none was provided. The lamp was tiny - the bathroom dirty. We turned around and went right back down to the front desk within 5 minutes of arriving. The hotel would not accommodate a room change and charged me the full price of the room when I said I could not stay. The front desk person was rude and unhelpful. We changed hotels, but the next four days were spent in the ""meeting room"" at The Belvedere where we tolerated housekeeping spraying cleaning fluid WHILE the class was going on, confusion over our pre-ordered refreshments for breaks, and a tiny amount of space that made small groups impossible. Not a good experience AT ALL.",Date of stay: October 2007,Belvedere Hotel,4,"New York City, New York"
Exceptional hotel,I travel a great deal for work and my schedule takes me from NC to AR. I have stayed at this hotel 4 times in the past 8 months and I now plan my driving schedule so that I can time my overnight stay at this hotel. The front desk personnel are extremely nice and very helpful. The hotel in general - and the rooms in particular - are clean and in good condition. The hotel looks new. The breakfast buffet is exceptional with cinnamon rolls that are addictive! I can highly recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: November 2008,Holiday Inn Express Dickson,4,"Dickson, Tennessee"
My favorite place!,"Our family has been vacationing on Marco Island for over 40 years. A few years ago, we stumbled across Verdi's quite by accident while visiting Century 21 Realty, located close by. What a discovery! It has become our favorite place on the island -- and one of my favorite places in the country. I think about the hazelnut or almond encrusted tilapia long after I have returned home. The desserts are fabulous, the bread devine, and the service superb. You definitely get the feeling of family when you are there. They have accomodated the food requests of my adolescent, finicky niece as well as the picky adults in the group and have always made our family feel comfortable and familiar.",,Verdi's An American Bistro,4,"Marco Island, Florida"
