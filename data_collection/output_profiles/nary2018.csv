Beautiful experience,"Food and service so lovely here. Patio feels private, dined under a lemon tree and the whole meal was clearly prepared with love ❤️",Date of visit: July 2018,Alexander Garden Restaurant,4,"Skopelos, Greece"
Blissful afternoon !!,"Had a fantastic afternoon on the water with captain Dimitris. Toured breathtaking islands near Skiathos, private beaches, to a special spot he knew about for urchins and fouscas (type of oyster) where he proceeded to dive, bring on deck and prepare a feast. HIGHLY recommend! He was professional and easy going the entire journey and had everything to make the trip special including music, cold beer and a fresh fruit platter he made up on the spot. Will remember always",Date of experience: July 2018,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Heaven on a plate,"Calamari will be hard to surpass even for me and the EasyGreek! Epic meal!!! Server Sonny fantastic and so intuitive ✨
Lobster cream sauce on halibut and potatoes, homemade strawberry sorbet with white chocolate and shortcake. Both dreaming about this meal for a very long time, will go back for sure.",Date of visit: May 2018,Cafe Chianti,4,"Halifax, Canada"
