Lovely Saturday Lunch,"Popped in for Saturday lunch and we were not disappointed, lovely food, friendly and attentive staff and a nice atmosphere.",Date of visit: March 2020,The Great Shefford,1,"Great Shefford, United Kingdom"
Underwhelming,"We visited for an impromptu Saturday lunch, phoning ahead about 30 mins before. The welcome was friendly and sincere and we were shown to our table straight away. I was able to taste the ales and elected for a pint of pint of Ramsbury Gold which was delicious and in great condition.
The menu was varied and all sounded lovely; my wife chose the crispy Brie starter and Chicken and Bacon pie whilst I went for French Onion soup and Fish pie.
My wife’s Brie was Ok but my soup, whilst delicious, was lukewarm; I ate it and mentioned it after as I was very hungry and it was not a big issue. When our mains arrived the pastry crust on my wife’s pie was not cooked in the middle and had to be returned for replacement. As I had my fish pie in front of me I ate it while we waited, it was tasty but quite frankly a bit on the small side and only contained one variety of fish; I’ve certainly had a lot better in the past at other venues. My wife’s replacement pie was fine.
This was not a bad experience but it did not, in my opinion, live up to other reviews and it’s overall rating on this site.",Date of visit: March 2020,The Fox at Peasemore,1,"Newbury, United Kingdom"
Great Cod Almighty!!!,"By chance we haven’t had anything from the Blue Dolphin for a few months but we really fancied it tonight. In a massive break from my traditional curry roll and chips with curry sauce (always delicious) I opted for a large cod and shared a “small” chips with my wife; she stayed with her regular Spam fritter.
The fish was one of the best pieces I have ever had from a chippie, large, fresh and perfectly fried; I left nothing for the dog!
Fantastic, thank you.",Date of visit: December 2019,The Blue Dolphin,1,"Newbury, United Kingdom"
Heavenly Cocktails,We did not eat in the Blue Harbour as we had already decided on other venues but we had delicious cocktails here on several occasions. Service was friendly and professional and the small plates of complementary fruit were very tasty and fresh. Lovely!,Date of visit: August 2019,Blue Harbor,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Disappointing,"Having read all the great reviews we were looking forward to some traditional Greek cuisine in an authentic rustic setting. We chose Sunday night which offered spit-roasted lamb as the night's speciality.
As we arrived reasonably early we chose a table on the shingled area to the side of the main terrace with an unspoiled view of the sunset.
The main menu was very short and did not have many of the Greek ""regulars"" we might have chosen but we were unconcerned and both ordered the spit-roast lamb.
We expected succulent lamb fresh from the spit but we got plates of lamb that had been carved and kept warm from some time before serving; tough, dry and not very hot.
Never mind - at least we had the view....until the staff allowed 3 women to drag a table across from the terrace and set up in front of us! Thanks for that all concerned.
There are better options in Magganos and we won't be back.",Date of visit: August 2019,Ionion,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Authentic Thai in Fiscardo!,"We tried the Lord Falcon as a change from the delicious Greek cuisine we had sampled all week so it had a lot to live up to! It did not disappoint; stepping through into the partially covered dining area the whole atmosphere felt real with mosquito coils adding that evocative Thai fragrance to the ambience.
The food was amazing - very authentic and tasty - and the service was great.
If you are looking for a break from Greek food for the night this is perfect.",Date of visit: August 2019,Lord Falcon Thai Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
The Best!!,"Dimitrios and Efthimia, with the able assistance of Mohammed, gave us what was simply the best day of our holiday (and probably of many recent holidays).
The warmest of hosts, everything they did and provided was first rate.
With a boatload of lovely fellow guests, an amazing experience helping with the nets, beautiful beaches, crystal clear waters and incredible fresh food this was an amazing day we will always treasure and recommend. Well worth the 5:30 alarm and 6 a.m.start from Fiscardo. Thank you!!",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Beautiful, clean harbour","A beautiful harbour surrounded by multiple restaurants, bars and boutique shops. The harbour side is bustling and lively and a great location for an evening of people watching, drinks and food.",Date of experience: August 2019,Fiscardo Harbor,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Clean and pretty beach with a fantastic taverna behind,"This small, attractive, beach was pretty much ideal for us and we had a lovely day here. If you are not a water sport (paddle boarding etc) fan and are based in the Fiscardo area then this beach, i.m.h.o., offers as much as Antisamos in a smaller package and without the 45 minute drive south. 2 Sunbeds with an umbrella were €10 for the day so much as everywhere else. My one recommendation would be to take beach/sea shoes with robust soles as the shingle is particularly uncomfortable on the bare soles of your feet.",Date of experience: August 2019,Agia Jerusalem Beach,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Delicious Cocktails,Theodora's was a regular drop-in for us when out for the evening in Fiscardo. Delicious cocktails and refreshing beer served at the harbour side on a lively and attractive waterfront by genuinely friendly and pleasant staff. What's not to like!!,Date of visit: August 2019,Theodora's Cafe Bar,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Super Stifado,"Following a disappointing meal at another Magganos establishment the night before we opted for the Kefall-Oinia and were not disappointed, With a choice of 3 seating options (Restaurant, Garden or the ""Olive"") we elected to sit in the Olive which is a tiny area of 4 tables across the road from the restaurant and outside an old cottage front. Our food was delicious and, judging by the comments from those around us, this was not the exception. The Stifado was the best I have eaten in a long time and the service was excellent.",Date of visit: August 2019,Kefall-Oinia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great food and service near a beautiful beach,"During a day on the Jerusalem beach we used the taverna to get morning coffee and for our lunch.
As everything is freshly cooked the taverna does not offer a food service before 12:30 but, when the owner told us this in response for a request for toast he also rustled up some biscuits free of charge to keep the wolf from the door!
We returned just after 12:30 for lunch and were grateful we did as all the tables were soon filled up and no wonder as the food was amazing and served by the most pleasant and friendly staff.
We plan to return to Cephalonia in the near future; Odysseas and Jerusalem Beach will definitely be on our itinerary",Date of visit: August 2019,Odysseas Taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Gastro Taverna!,"Absolutely amazing food set against the backdrop of Fiscardo harbour; we opted for a table on the balcony to the back of the harbourside and had a thoroughly enjoyable meal with delicious food and friendly, enthusiastic service. If we have one criticism the balcony tended to be out of the immediate vision of the senior serving staff and lacked a ""permanent"" presence to easily arrange for requests or questions to be addressed. This was only a minor inconvenience in an overall great experience.",Date of visit: August 2019,Apagio Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Always tasty and fresh,"We regularly use this f&c shop and would recommend it to anyone. Friendly staff, delicious food and a great choice. As to one of the recent negative reviews I’d love to understand how you can judge how long a piece of cod has been cooked for by looking at it through the glass of the cabinet and why someone would think it was OK to take the latest cooked fish and leave the “old” one for someone else - just plain selfish and small minded really. Never mind if they don’t come again - the ever present, happy, queue says it all; you will certainly see me in there again.",Date of visit: March 2019,The Blue Dolphin,1,"Newbury, United Kingdom"
Fantastic meal to end our holiday,"Last night of our holiday and a meal here was a fitting end to a great week.
With the whole square full of carnival goers and noise we were welcomed into this haven of Spanish cuisine and culture and proceeded to have a faultless meal with impeccable and informal service at a leisured pace - there was no attempt to move us on despite a healthy queue of hopeful diners.
This is not a cheap nights food but you get what you pay for!!",Date of visit: March 2019,Victor Montes Restaurante,1,"Bilbao, Spain"
Needs some TLC and concentration on customer experience,"We stayed in the hotel several years ago and were looking forward to a return visit.
This was carnival week so we knew there would be street noise that is unavoidable but the warm weather would be offset by the air conditioning in the rooms. Great plan if the hotel had switched it on centrally. We called from our sweltering room at about midnight and a guy came and fiddled with the circuit breakers and left saying we would not be charged for the room. In the morning we were charged full rate.
The full rate included one ancient sachet of coffee in a double room (412) and no milk or milk powder, a rusty pointed metal stud that was the remainder of a rubber door stop situated about 10 cm outside of the shower enclosure and a sparse and 0random selection of complementary toiletries and accessories. We had 3 rooms and the ac was the same in each so €250 total price to roast for the night.
I think this will be our last stay at this hotel as clearly economy of running costs is more important than customer comfort.",Date of stay: March 2019,Hotel Abando,1,"Bilbao, Spain"
Rank restaurant and invisible stagg,"Popped in at just after 7pm for pizza and salad. Not a single member of staff anywhere in front of house for over 3 minutes. Tables with dirty crockery and glasses around the restaurant and people waiting to pay at the bar after giving up on seeing any waiting staff, unfortunately no one behind the bar either.
We were seated about 8 mins after arriving and handed menus. For the next 10 mins, having decided what we wanted, we waited for someone to come and take our order. During the wait I had a chance to go and look at the salad bar to find it in a shocking state with various ingredients all over the others and the surfaces and floor, nachos in just about everything and the dregs remaining of the lettuce, onions, peppers and tomatoes. The whole restaurant floor was filthy and covered in various dropped food items. Eventually a waitress arrived but we had lost any desire to eat and left. On the way out we noted that not one single dirty table had been cleaned since our arrival some 20 minutes before despite there being at least 3 front of house (very occasionally) staff on duty.
Disgusting hygiene and lazy staff - thank goodness we didn’t eat anything or, judging by other recent reviews, use the toilets. What has gone wrong here in the last few months!",Date of visit: December 2018,Pizza Hut,1,"Newbury, United Kingdom"
Not a great experience,"We tried the 5 bells on a Wednesday early evening as we are keen to find new places at which to eat in our local area.
Initial impressions were OK; we were seated near the bar access hatch and asked if this was alright, which it was.
The menu, despite the tatty dog-eared appearance of the sheets of paper, offered a reasonable choice, not extensive but with choices that suited us both and we ordered a Camembert and the Black Pudding Scotch Egg for starters with a Ham Egg and Chips and a Ribeye Steak for mains. We were surprised that the waitress needed to check that both the mains we had chosen were available.
To accompany this we asked for a bottle of Viognier. When the wine arrived we were not asked if we wanted to taste it and it was not chilled. We had to ask for some ice to put in it to get it to an enjoyable temperature; it had clearly not been stored in a chiller.
After about 10 mins one of the waiting staff returned to tell us that the last Camembert had “just been sold” and my wife would need to choose a new starter. This was somewhat surprising as there did not seem to be any other diners who were eating starters and it had taken so long to arrive at this statement; also we were a little surprised that there was not enough of this in stock to cover more orders, especially given how early our visit was and the proximity of the pub to towns and shops. As it had not been made immediately apparent that it was not available my wife had set her heart on the Camembert and somewhat begrudgingly opted for the Scotch Egg I had chosen - luckily 2 of these were available!
The food that we had was fine with the exception of the triple-cooked chips which were, effectively, overcooked chips from a packet rather than anything closer to what we were expecting.
Possibly because we had been let down in our choice of starter we were constantly asked by every passing staff member if our food was OK, this became tedious after a while as it continuously disturbed our meal and on more than one occasion our response was not actually wanted as observations such as “judging by the empty plates it all must have been good” were made before we had a chance to respond; don’t ask if you need to steer the answer to what you want to hear.
With so many other good choices of venue in the area we will not be returning to this pub again.",Date of stay: August 2018,Five Bells,1,"Wickham, United Kingdom"
Shambles,"Went for an early lunch and after a very nice starter we then got our main course 2 hours later (well one of them at least - we had to send the other back). Plenty of people getting good service but we sat and stared at our dirty starter crockery for 30 mins before flagging down a waiter to clear them, a wait of about 45 mins provoked me to ask for our mains to be told they were ""on their way"". 20 mins later I asked for the manager to explain their absence and he attended with the wrong orders details. Once everything had been sorted he gave us a 100% discount on our bill. My wife sent her ham egg and chips back as the ham looked like it had been plated up 2 hours before, my burger was fine. Thank goodness we didn't order anything complicated or I think we would still be there!
One of our old favourite haunts bites the dust :-(",Date of visit: May 2017,The Black Boy,1,"Reading, United Kingdom"
Fantastic,"OMG such good food. Great atmosphere, very busy and noisy - fantastic.
Octopus to die for, great wine, Tuna tartare with the most exquisite taste all accompanied by excellent service. We will be back.",Date of visit: March 2017,La Tapeoteca,1,"Murcia, Spain"
Still Great,"Despite some recent reviews we find that this restaurant has not gone downhill at all and remains a pleasant and friendly destination.
We get used to a surfeit of tables in the U.K. and forget the that this little village is often overrun by skiers but only for 3 months each year - you need to think ahead and book!
Imagine a Spanish restaurant having menus in a different language! Some of the translated versions may be a little inaccurate but ""€25 per persona"" doesn't take a lot of interpreting.
The Albondigas (meatballs for JonM) are fantastic, everything else is great.",Date of visit: February 2017,Frankfurt Aragon,1,"Formigal, Spain"
Great food and enjoyable chaos!,"Really great food. My Turbot was fantastic and my wife's Iberico and asparagus ravioli equally so. Great service and lovely atmosphere - the waitress was really laid back and efficient whilst her male colleague was somewhat effervescent but genuinely committed and keen.
We loved it!",Date of visit: February 2017,Restaurante Divino formigal,1,"Formigal, Spain"
Great location and lovely stay,"The hotel is really in a great location and the parking is incredibly convenient and reasonably priced.
We had a lovely room and enjoyed the simple breakfast very much.
All the staff were very pleasant and helpful.
Thank you!",Date of stay: December 2016,Hotel Hospederia Almunia,1,"Caravaca de la Cruz, Spain"
Delicious food and open on a Thursday!!!,"We dropped in after going to other highly rated restaurants that couldn't be bothered to open despite their published hours
A warm welcome, friendly service and a fantastic Secreto Iberico that was such a good size that we took their advice and shared - thank goodness as wasting something so delicious would be sinful.
Top marks - thank you",Date of visit: December 2016,El Horno,1,"Caravaca de la Cruz, Spain"
Lovely (except the risotto),"After a visit to Ikea we dropped in to Thader looking for a late lunch. Everywhere was quiet as it was a dull and wet day but La Tagliatella was busy with a nice buzz about it so we gave it a try.
We ordered a Tagliatella salad between us followed by a iberico risotto for my wife and a tagliatelle rustico for me. A glass each of the only white wine (a very nice Verdejo) completed the order.
The salad was amazing and a really good size, my pasta was excellent too. My wife's risotto was a little too salty (we later noticed other reviewers had said the same - management take note!)
Service was excellent and we will definitely return - just avoiding the risotto.",Date of visit: November 2016,"La Tagliatella C/Julian Romea, Murcia",1,"Murcia, Spain"
Truly shocking experience,"One of our favourite restaurants in London - until Saturday.
After superb starters and the incredible duck salad we waited and waited for our mains. After 25 minutes and as the girls needed to get to an appointment and time was getting short I asked a waiter to chase up our food. 10 minutes later the ladies left with no main courses appearing. Slowly the food trickled out and the managers only initial response to me was to take 1/2 the rice away and remove it from the bill.
Eventually and grudgingly he offered a 20% discount on the bill. I accepted this and we tucked in.
A few minutes later a very abrupt waitress arrived and slammed down Crispy Duck for 2, I told her we had not ordered it and she told me I was wrong - I had to point out the guys opposite trying to get her attention as it was theirs. Even then she went back to the waiter station to check
For the next 20 mins we were continually, and rudely, asked if we had finished despite the fact that we were plainly still eating.
When the bill arrived I asked for the 12.5% service charge to be removed because of the appalling attitudes displayed after our complaint but was told this was part of the previous discount! I gave up and paid so we could leave.
So a restaurant we have enjoyed over a dozen times and recommended to many others was only prepared to give us a 7.5% discount for a ruined experience - the shocking attitude problems were free though.
Thanks to all on duty that day for destroying all the good work your predecessors had done. I hope none of you ever have to be made to feel so unwelcome as we did.
You won't be seeing us again in a hurry.",Date of visit: November 2016,Plum Valley Restaurant,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Great food & service,"A last minute choice and one of our best!
Great food, lovely service and a Viognier to die for (Spanish too!!)
We will be back",Date of visit: October 2016,Khonkaen Thai Cuisine,1,"Newbury, United Kingdom"
Great stay,"Booked at the last minute this was a great choice by my wife.
Beautiful room, great staff and fantastic location. The pool could do with modernising but was still enjoyable and busy later in the day. Great cocktails on my sun lounger - what's not to like!",Date of stay: August 2016,"Hotel Alfonso XIII, A Luxury Collection Hotel, Seville",1,"Seville, Spain"
Amazing Flamenco and a good meal,"Booked the later (21:30) show and opted for dinner to accompany the dancing. The food was of a good standard, the Flamenco was amazing! The show lasted about 90 minutes and it would be difficult to pick out the best bits as it was all amazingly and incredibly passionately performed.",Date of visit: August 2016,Tablao el Arenal,1,"Seville, Spain"
Wow - wait for a table!,Just had some of the best tapas I have ever eaten! Wandered in off the street and really lucked out as a stream of others who obviously had Pimenton picked out as a destination turned up after us to be asked to wait 20 mins for a table (they all did). Great food and service but the excuse that our beautiful bottle of Albariño has evaporated in the heat fell on deaf ears so we had to pay for another - outrageous!!!,Date of visit: August 2016,El Pimenton,1,"Seville, Spain"
Late Father's Day Booking,"My wife booked this restaurant for a Father's Day late lunch on the day.
Although the restaurant had been extremely busy prior to our arrival it was immaculately clean and tidy; the staff were very pleasant and courteous, giving no indication of the strenuous shift they had already completed.
All4 of us enjoyed the experience and the delicious food we were served.",Date of visit: June 2016,Carnarvon Arms,1,"Newbury, United Kingdom"
Beautiful new decor - same great food!,"Having moved away from the immediate area recently we have not had the pleasure of a Miah's meal for a while.
As we were in the area and were keen to see the new decor we dropped in for a sit-down meal.
The facelift and new layout in the restaurant give it a sophisticated and contemporary feel whilst the new menu maintains the excellent quality of food.
We had a delicious meal with excellent service - situation normal for Ash and his team!",Date of visit: June 2016,Miah's - Spencers Wood,1,"Reading, United Kingdom"
Hidden Gem,"Recommended to us, this little place lived up to its promise.
I had the menu del dia -a tuna salad, scrambled egg with asparagus and from the choice of mains I had the Bacalao. Everything was delicious.
My wife had various tapa, all of which she really enjoyed especially the black Iberico ham and fried egg in a crispy baguette portion - so good she wants to come back for dinner!",Date of visit: April 2016,Lataza,1,"Cehegin, Spain"
Still excellent (not for budget diners),"As good as last year (fab).
Don't come here looking for loads of average food at a modest price.
Don't come here expecting to be allowed to let your noisy kids spoil everyone else's evening whilst you ignore them.
Do come here if you want excellent innovative food at a price that you couldn't match in any more cosmopolitan towns.
Do come here as a family who appreciate good food in a civilised environment
Excellent",Date of visit: February 2016,Cellisca Restaurante,1,"Formigal, Spain"
£&@****,"Can't put a value on good service and Arrigal hasn't bothered.
Despite having a Table booked for 6 and people queueing for walk-in tables they let a stroppy guy push in font of us all sand sit at a table for 3 with his wife and kid.
Had to make up a table for us as if we were a surprise and then forgot half the cutlery.
Meals arrived over a period of 7 or 8 minutes whilst waiter served 2 other tables and got distracted by noisy rude kids running about whilst their parents ignored them.
Bread added to the bill which we never had ordered or received.
But a frozen pizza from the supermarket and save the hassle
Oh yes - my sons €14 lasagne was the size of a small starter",Date of visit: February 2016,Pizzeria Arrigal,1,"Formigal, Spain"
New lows of hygiene and cleanliness,"Always a scruffy and grimy pre-match venue, The Slug hit new lows this Sunday with
Urine from the blocked gents loos streaming through the ceiling into the bar area. Putting a couple of bottle bins under huge leak and carrying on regardless must be unacceptable these days?",Date of experience: February 2016,The Redback,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Nice generally but a very expensive room!,"We stayed for 2 nights (Friday and Saturday) to attend a friend's wedding. The room had been pre-reserved for us by the Bride and, as there were 3 of us, we were allocated the Family Room.
We were shown up to the room and told that the futon in the sitting room would be made up for our son before we retired. I signed a sheet of paper for the room discovered that the rate was £250 per night; somewhat excessive for an average standard of room in a small rural hotel. No doubt the room looks impressive on first entering but once settled we found that the decor was a trifle tired and worn, especially in the bathroom and my son found that the futon had a very poor mattress and was so uncomfortable that we discovered him asleep on the ""daybed"" sofa in the corner on our first morning (he has a futon in his den at home so it was not a case of him not being familiar and happy with this style of bed).
We had a pleasant dinner the first (Friday) night at the hotel but were a little surprised to sit down at 9 o'clock to be told that they had run out of steaks.
On the plus side the staff were excellent, especially when not being unnecessarily micro-managed by the landlord, and the food was OK.",Date of stay: September 2015,The Bear and Ragged Staff,1,"Oxford, United Kingdom"
Tranquil and comfortable,"Beautiful setting and clean, comfortable and well equipped houses. We stayed for 10 days and found this to be an ideal location to be based whilst we explored Northwest Murcia. Within 5 minutes drive of the centres of Caravaca and Cehegin the site couldn't' be better for getting to the attractions and restaurants of the area.
On site there is a well kept swimming pool and a laundry room and the rooms are just as described on the website.",Date of stay: September 2015,Casas Rurales,1,"Caravaca de la Cruz, Spain"
Traditional and enjoyable Tapas restaurant,"Delicious tapas from this little gem of a restaurant. Friendly service and good quality combined with some very good value offers (12 king prawns in batter and 6 x 200ml beers for €10!).
In the tradition of Spain don't arrive before about 9pm as they may not have got round to opening",Date of visit: September 2015,La Maestranza,1,"Caravaca de la Cruz, Spain"
Well worth the visit,Great food and choice of pleasant siting areas. We sat in the roof terrace area and had the half Peltilla and a Fillet steak. Both were delicious. Our young waitress was attentive and polite and the atmosphere and ambience were superb,Date of visit: September 2015,Restaurante El Sol,1,"Cehegin, Spain"
