An unmissable experience.,"We had the extreme pleasure of doing this trip last July and our family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children of 8 and 12) loved the trip so much we knew we just had to do it agin this year. Efi and Demetri are the perfect hosts for your day and make you feel extremely welcome from the very minute you step on board. It may seem like an early start however you will not regret it. Breakfast is served on board with coffee and pastries but the best is the bread served with slathering of Efi’s homemade marmalade.

There are two stops to help them haul in their catch from the nets that they have put out even earlier in the morning! The nets are brought in quite slowly so you can see each fish coming in. Efi patiently describes each fish and lets the children (and grown ups) take the fish out of the nets so they can see and feel the experience in equal measure. This year we caught parrot fish, red snapper, bream, cuttlefish, starfish, perch, and a flying fish.

Once the fishing is done the rest of the day is dedicated to stopping at a number of remote little coves that you can really only access by boat. These little treasure are what dreams are made of. White shores and crystal clear blue waters. You can dive off the boat and swim in or just relax on the boat. The highlight of the kids day is when Demetri stops at a beach where there is an abundance of natural clay just in the rocks on the shore. If you fancy a spa treatment while out a sea just rub this all over you and let it dry in to make your skin feel lovely!

While you are swimming, Efi and Demetri prepare lunch on board which, if you are a fish fan, is just heavenly. Some of the fish you have just help to catch being cooked in front of your eyes - it doesn’t get much fresher than that. All this topped off with breads, salads full of vegetables fresh from their garden and not least their own homegrown wine.

On the way back Demetri lets the kids take to the helm and do a bit of sailing which they think is amazing. You could not ask to meet a more lovely couple to spend the day with. They share all their expertise with you and make your trip feel very personal. The boat is not crowded like on other trips we have been on. After the trip was over Demetri very kindly helped our son set up his fishing rod as we had brought one with us but no idea how to use! He didn’t need to do this but it was no trouble. I would highly recommend this trip as an experience not to be missed.",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
A little Caribbean Gem,"I recently stayed at the Catalonia Gran Dominicus for a week on an All Inclusive basis with my partner and our two children (8 & 4). We had an absolutely amazing time and really did feel we were in paradise. I was slightly worried about the transfer time as many people had said 90 minutes but we were at the hotel (albeit in a transfer with no-one else) in about 45 minutes. We were greeted by extremely friendly staff upon arrival and were made to feel very welcome. Our room which was at the reception end of the complex was perfectly adequate for our needs and had amazing air conditioning (in fact it was so cold we had to turn it down a few times). The room was cleaned and the beds made every day with towels changed very regulalry which was lovely. We were even treated to some 'towel sculptures' on the beds whcih the kids loved. There was a well stocked mini bar too and a safe in the room for which there was no extra charges. The room even had an ironing board. Yes the decor might have been a bit dated and dark but it certainly didnt have any negative impact on our holiday.

I have to say I was worried about the food with two younger children but the range of food available was second to none and they certainly didn't go hungry while we were there. The fresh omlettes and fruit at breakfast were a firm favourite with all the family. They also have a childrens buffet (which had a smaller selection off the main bufet) which they loved as they felt very independent. WIthin our package we were given tickets that allowed us to eat at the speciality restaurants too. Whilst the food here was extremely good I didnt feel they catered to the children as well as the buffet - that said my 8 year old managed to eat her way through a New York steak with no problems! The pancake bar on the beach was a favourite spot for us all and just filled the gaps between meals. This was also a great place for the kids to go and get their own drinks.

There is no denying that this is not a resort that has many British people visit it (I think we were the only brits there over our week) so if you were wanting to go and meet lots of people from home then I diont think this is the resort for you. That said we see enough Brits at home so we loved the opportunity to meet the European and American visitors. As per usual they all put us to shame by speaking perfect English so even the kids were able to communciate with the French and Sapnsih speaking children.

We found all the staff to be extremely pleasant and hard working individuals. It is not uncommon to see the same staff that have served you at the crack of dawn still beavering away late at night. In my oppinion they do this with very little complaint. When walkig around the complex I was amazed at how many employees they have and they were constantly working on the gardens and grounds. Every single employee who we walked past said Hola without fail which the kids loved. The same can be said of the entertainment staff. Yes the entertainment was not to my liking but I am not a huge fan of holiday entertainment anyway but I thought that the staff worked tirelessly all day long. There was a huge array of activities for all to do from pool activities, to volley ball, to water aerobics in the sea, boules, dancing etc. I didnt find the entertainment staff pushy at all. The shows were a little late in my opinion if you have children as they didn't start until 10 o'clock but when the kids managed to stay awake for the Michael Jackson show they were spell bound!

Finally the hotel has to be in one of the most beautiful spots I have ever stayed and we have many picture postcard images of the kids sitting in palm trees, lying on beautiful white sands or swimming in the bluest of seas. A truely perfect holiday in my mind and certainly great value for money.",Date of stay: June 2014,Catalonia Gran Dominicus,4,Dominican Republic
James Martin actually cooked for us!,"My partner and I ate at the James Martin Restaurant during a recent two night stay at the Talbot Hotel. We were on a package sold through Amazon local that included a 3 course meal in the restaurant with a value of about £40.00 per head. We also received a bottle of Prosecco on arrival but were given the option of having this with our dinner which was nice.

The restaurant itself is quite small with about 15 tables so is perfect for a quiet, intimate night. The decor is very pretty and it is quite clear it has all been recently renovated. Overall our experience of the whole night was amazing. The allowance covered the three courses perfectly and I think we only had to pay a small additional cost to cover the coffees. My starter of morel mushrooms and asparagus in a broth was just beautiful - so tasty but delicate. Our mains of lamb and pork were both equally as delicious. The meat is served quite pink which was perfect for us as that is how we like our meat but for those who are not so keen I would recommend asking for it to be cooked slightly longer as it did appear that most of the meat is cooked on the rarer side of the scale. The portion sizes are on the smaller size but I think that is because your expectation is that James Martins portions will be like those on Saturday Kitchen which always look very generous. Although on the small size, once you have had your starter, main and dessert we were both very full (and we like to eat!). My partner had the cheese board which gave him about 6 portions of a selection of cheeses. It was nice to be offered all the cheese as I thought they might have made him pick just three.

A gentleman on the table behind us did complain about his food being undercooked (I think he had fish) and the waitress immediately took his plate back to the kitchen. What I did think was a nice touch was they also took his wife's plate to keep it warm while they re-did his meal. When they brought them back out again they had actually redone her meal for her. About 5 minutes after the waitress brought their food back, James Martin himself came out of the kitchen in his chefs whites and apologised profusely to the couple. I was amazed as i didn't think he would be there! I think we were just very lucky as when I asked the waitress how often he was in the restaurant she said that we were lucky as he had been there all week as they were rolling out a new menu.

I think the only negatives I would give was that some of the service was a little slow and lacking in areas and we did feel we had been left a little too long without being dealt with. The atmosphere was also a bit lacking as each table was very quiet and I did feel a little like I had to mind my Ps and Qs.

We met James Martin in the car park again in the morning as he was returning to get ready for the next days lunch shift and he was extremely lovely in giving us 10 minutes of his time. He is obviously very passionate about his home town and developing the economy of the local area. They have plans for a microbrewery and other developments in a few of the surrounding buildings which I think would be great.

Overall a lovely evening with some extremely tasty food. Would definitely recommend it.",Date of visit: May 2014,The Wentworth Restaurant,4,"Malton, United Kingdom"
Perfect Valentines Treat,"My partner booked a surprise night away on Valentines Day and I was not disappointed. The room we had (I think no 4) was at the front of the hotel overlooking the Lake - the views were stunning despite the drizzle. Our room appeared to have recently been decorated and although we had no shower we had huge mounts of very hot water to relax in a lovely bath after long walks. The bed was one of the comfiest we have ever slept in. Fab English breakfast and extremely pleasant and helpful staff.

The walk at the back of the hotel is lovely and gives fantastic views of the Lake - well worth the effort.",Date of stay: February 2014,Ambleside Lake House,4,"Ambleside, United Kingdom"
Brilliant Easter Day Out,"My partner and I recently took out 2 children aged 3 and 8 to the Crocky Trail and they both had the BEST day out. I was worried that the three year old would be too young but he is quite a gutsy little boy and he took it all in his stride. We did go after a dry spell so there wasn't too much mud about but I think for older children that is probably half the fun. This felt like how playing out used to be before we all became too worried about health and safety. Lots of little bridges over streams and clambering through trees. We took a picnic and there are plenty of places, both at the beginning where all the slides and rides are and along the trail itself, to stop and have a butty and a break.

Would definitely go again and would recommend it to anyone. For any adult wanting to feel like a child again this is a brilliant day out too.",Date of experience: April 2014,Crocky Trail,4,"Waverton, United Kingdom"
Cant wait to go again!,"We stayed at the Pacifae on a B & B basis last year with our two children (aged 2 and 6) and ABSOLUTELY loved the place. Whilst I totally appreciate everyone is entitled to their own opinion I always am shocked when reviews are so varied. The family made us feel extremely welcome and loved our children (which resulted in them being given lots of free icecreams by the Dad of the family - I apologise I forget his name!). The setting of the hotel is beautiful with fantastic views of the sea and the mountains. The pool and bar area were always impecably clean whilst we were there and our room absolutely perfect. I'm not entirely sure what facilities some people want - if you want all the luxuries of home, then stay at home! The family and Katelios are very authentic greek which I would imagine is why people visit other countries. The walk down to the village does take about 15 minutes but is hardly too much effort and we did it with 2 chiildren and a buggy every single day either to visit the beach or the restaurants.
My children have not stopped talking about that holiday so much so that we have just booked for a two week Half Board holiday from the 10th July 2013. I can't tell you the last time I counted down the days until I went on holiday! I am very much looking forward to staying again and will report back on any improvements that the family have made since 2012. See you in a week Pacifae!",Date of stay: August 2012,Pacifae Golden Village,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Wonderful 'childhood memory' kind of holiday,"We recently spent a fantastic week at the site and even though the weather was not great, we couldn't have enjoyed ourselves more. Malcolm and Tracy were the perfect reps and couldn't have done any more to help. The site in my mind was perfect for younger children which suited us as we have a 7 and a 3 year old. The pool and surroundings were wonderful and I would thoroughly recommend the grand defi (go ape type place) - they have courses suitable for children from 2 years old. The bouncy castles and games room keep them entertained while you can relax with a drink at the bar. Axel who is the owner is very attentive to his guests. Would definitely go back again.",Date of stay: May 2013,Yelloh! Village Chateau de la Foret,4,"Saint-Julien-des-Landes, France"
