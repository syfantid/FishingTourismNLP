Ps- try the Escape Room, was great fun!",Date of stay: October 2018,Olympic Palace Resort Hotel,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Birthday Meal for the Missus,"Looked interesting on-line so decided to try a walk-in when we finally bumped into it.

Very pleasant atmosphere and friendly welcome. Got a decent table and the service was prompt.

2 couples - ordered rack of ribs to share for starters - delicious. I had the 600g bone-in rib steak, my wife had the duck, the other couple had the rib eye special. All cooked perfectly; mine was one of the best tasting steaks I have had. With wine and drinks and sides, no room for dessert came to 40 euros a head. Not bad for the quality and the location.

Excellent meal.

Ps spare a thought for the lad who brings the food from upstairs... VERY steep stairs!",Date of visit: July 2018,Cannibale Royale Ruysdaelkade,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"

Drinks with Brother-in-law,"Great pub, wonderful beer (Timmy Taylor Golden Best) and charismatic landlord. Proper pub, homely, traditional feel. In a great situation and visually striking pub. Can't speak for the food (yet), but everyone appeared satisfied. Love the quirky signs, which probably reflect the host's laconic sense of humour!",Date of stay: August 2016,The Black Horse,4,"Giggleswick, United Kingdom"

Honeymoon February 2016,"Just back from two weeks at the MCC for our honeymoon. Went with three other couples - brother-in-law, sister, best friend and respective partners.

Ok, so the MCC is 16 or so years old, and needs a lick of paint here and there...

However, this is a WONDERFUL hotel. The staff are amazing, helpful, considerate and attentive.

The food is very, very good: if you don't find something you enjoy, you are impossible to cater for. The seafood alone is worth the 10 hour flight.

Staff mentions: Jordan (Billiard Bar), Dannys, Elmeleidy (animation), Joseph, Roger, Jose and Phillipe (gardeners), Yuny (great waitress), Ariel (reception) and our wonderful chambermaids Olivia and Dianderys.

Hopefully we will re-visit!",Date of stay: February 2016,Melia Cayo Coco,4,"Cayo Coco, Cuba"
Wedding - Shaun and Linda,"Cannot thank the staff enough...

You all made our special day extraordinarily special.

Location wonderful, food amazing, room perfect, attention to detail intuitive and effortless... Eileen and Beth please take respective bows, you are both born for this.

Our wedding was perfect. Simple. Not a complaint, niggle or a whinge. Perfect.

Eternally grateful for the wonderful memories,

Shaun and Linda Veysey",Date of stay: February 2016,The Old Lodge,4,"Malton, United Kingdom"

Shopping fuel!,"It is what it is, a carvery. Decent food, good for the Yorkshire Soul. Good, attentive service. The only downside I would say is the price of the drinks - bottle of Ginger Beer £2.95. Everything else, can't complain.",Date of visit: December 2015,Russells of Coppergate,4,"York, United Kingdom"
Birthday Drinks for the Twins,Can't rate this pub highly enough. It's THE perfect public house. The beer is amazing. Go. But make sure there are enough seats and beer left for us!,Date of experience: November 2015,Snickleway Inn,4,"York, United Kingdom"

All I can say is that although you know what you're getting with a Premier Inn, the staff here are amazingly friendly and do everything they can to make your stay pleasant. The room was spotless, comfortable and the breakfast wonderful. Very impressed.",Date of stay: October 2015,Premier Inn Nottingham City Centre (Chapel Bar) hotel,4,"Nottingham, United Kingdom"
