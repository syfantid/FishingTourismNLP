0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nogah875,October 2020,5,Boat trip with Dimitris,"We had a blast with Dimitris! Spent a full day on his boat traveling from one amazing beach to another. Dimitris spoiled us with food and drinks and taught us about the area and sea life. Our kids (7 and 10) had a joy and loved it so much that we ""had"" to book another day with Dimitris! During the trip I lost my wedding ring in the sea and a day later Dimitris went back to that place and found it which was insane.. I have no idea how he managed to do it and it just shows what a great guy he is and how much he cares! I highly recommend this boat trip!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/726jadeh,August 2020,5,Best day of our holiday ❤ ,"This was our second trip out with Dimitris and this time we had a 14 year old with us & fair to say we all agreed this was the best day of our holiday (and we're only half way though!) Highlights included snorkeling & watching Dimitris dive for urchins and oysters. Dimitris caught a small octopus that we were able to pet.While on the boat we ate the freshest urchins, oysters, breem, prawns and fruit salad.The whole day was fantastic and I couldn't recommend it enough. "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelhD5718GA,August 2020,5,Best day everrrrrr,"This was hands down our best day of the holiday. Dimitris fed us from the second we stepped aboard the Alexander till the moment we disembarked 8 hours later. We had pastries fresh caught urchins, prawns, sea bream & beautiful fresh fruit platter, the compliment to this was an open bar with water & soft drinks for our teen. We had the most amazing eight hours visiting beautiful beaches inc Lalaria which was breath taking. I would definitely recommend this trip & will definitely be back, thank you Dimitris for making our holiday in Skiathos a memorable one."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/728georgek,August 2020,5,An excursion to remember,"We had our trip 4 days ago with a group of 6. Something you shouldn't miss in Skiathos. A beautiful experience which we love in every second.  We discovered places we haven't been plus we had some stops at Tsugrias and Lalaria. We had beautiful lunch cooked by captain Dimitris and amazing fruits salads.What you will expect is ....swimming at the most beautiful places on Skiathos,  some snorkeling,  delicious meal, drinks and of course dont forget to capture some beautiful skiathos spots.

4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/athanasiosk592,August 2020,5,Best day of our vacations,"Me and my girlfriend wanted to have a private relaxed day around Skiathos and the nearby islands as too take fool advantage of the beauty Skiathos has to offer but is accessible only by boat. I spoke with Dimitris on the phone and he was very clear on what our day plan would be.We met in the morning and the amazing experience began! Got our coffee, relaxed on the comfy seats and sailed away... We visited many beaches, caves where we got to swim all the way at the end, had amazing food and live sea food from the bottom of the sea!Dimitris is an amazing captain! We had a lot of fun, interesting discusions and info of the places we visited. After the trip we had a coffee all together and Dimitris helped us taking our staff to the main port as we were going to the mainland the same day and got us a souvenir!!Also it was just me my gf and 2 Italian friends, so it was really relaxed. As I noticed other boats were really crowded and commercial.Next time we will be in Skiathos we will definitely join him for another day in paradise!"

The boat is big enough that although it was windy we didn’t have any problem. We recommend captain Dimitris for a safe and unique experience.

Fully equipped with life jackets even for small children, fishing gear and a fridge full of drinks and snacks.Highly recommended."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CamembertBedford,July 2019,5,Wonderful day with my son fishing,Firstly Dimitrios the owner and Captain of this boat is a super host and very kind and thoughtful with his guests. You couldn't want for a better fisherman to take you out. The boat is lovely and clean and not too big to be impersonal and not too small to feel cramped. We chartered the day for just my son (6 years old) and I to go out and rod fish and Dimitrios was great with him. Showed him how to fish an helped him. We stopped for a magical swim at a cave on the way back and made superb memories. he 32 fish we caught we took to a local tavern a I had the chef cook them. This was one of the best days of our holiday. We will be back. Make sure you do this trip!

4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katliappis,July 2019,5,"Liked it so much, did it twice!","This was my second time going on the trip with Dimitri (my family and I went two years prior) and it was even better than the last time! A beautiful excursion out at sea, fresh-caught sea urchins for lunch (and an amazing fruit plate for dessert!) and snorkeling with Dimitri while he lured in fish for us to see was a “twice” in a lifetime experience. Captain Dimitri is friendly and engaging, and he has constantly worked towards making his experience better every time (something I can personally attest to). If you’re in Skiathos, this is the perfect day-trip!"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Go337128,September 2018,5,T,"Day spent on a yacht with Dimitrios, This is definitely one of the best exclusive tours you can imagine.

We stopped off for swimming, snorkelling, went to a cave, Dimitri cooked lunch with what had been caught and we had an amazing fruit salad in the afternoon!

Amazing value for money!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silverarcher,September 2018,5,Great morning's fishing,This was my 3rd and most successful fishing trip with Dimitris.

4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fotist703,September 2018,5,Daily boat trip around Skiathos,"There were many options in the port, but we were looking for something special and different. We got a proposition from our hotel to choose the specific boat with Dimitris as our captain. We didn’t even ask where we were going. We fully trusted Dimitris. The first impression of the boat was excellent.  Special decoration and a very warm welcome from him giving us the feeling we knew each other for long time. We started our trip on time visiting a small island opposite the port. We had time to dive, enjoy the sun and the wild life of the isolated island. Dimitris also dived to our surprise. As we found afterwards, he wanted to collect oysters and sea urchin for our lunch later on. We left the small island enjoying a very delicious croissant on board that Dimitris offered to us. While moving to our second stop we start fishing. In the end we had 2 tuna and a great lunch prepared by our captain. We stopped in super beautiful spots to enjoy our lunch, our drinks and have fun. Dimitris was a unique host. In general, an unforgettable boat trip. Dimitri, thanks a million for everything. U r the besterer"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manthoshotels,August 2018,5,KEEPS OUR GUESTS ALWAYS HAPPY,"In the beginning of the Summer, our Hotel guests asked from us to recomend a fishing trip or something different that they could do in order to discover the secret beauties of Skiathos island. We also tried to find out...Finally,we found that the best was SFT and Mr. Dimitris from that time we never stoped introducing him to our guests as everybody returned really happy , smiling  and relaxed. Mr Dimitris combines relaxing fishing trips , snorkeling , or private around the island cruises and even visits the other islands of North Sporades. Don't miss out to taste his recipes like : sea urchins, octopus, and traditionally cooked sea fruits"

2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/715evgeniam,July 2018,5,The only way worth seeing Skiathos!,"We didn’t really liked Skiathos until we went on Dimitris boat tour! Starting from the boat and the owner till the view, the unique waters we swam in and the amazing sunset hour, everything was beyond my expectations! I could include sea urchins in the menu for the rest of my life! Absolutely don’t miss the chance to merge into sea life!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexD4680,July 2018,5,Must do in Skiathos!,"We went on an evening fishing trip around 6:30pm - we saw the sunset and dolphins, caught some fish, saw the lunar eclipse and the rest of the amazing night sky. Straight after the trip, which took us to around 10pm, we went to a restaurant where our fresh fish was cooked for us and it was absolutely delicious. This was such a well thought out trip with refreshments and Dimitri was a great captain. Probably our best evening in Skiathos, I highly recommend it!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnabelleD_13,July 2018,5,Excellent boat trip,"Can highly recommend our boat trip around Skiathos and Skopelos.

Delicious food with croissants, seafood and fruit, plus ice-cold waters and wine. The boat was simple but a good size for seven of us."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eiphos_v,July 2018,5,Best trip I’ve ever had!!,Best trip i’ve ever had! We experienced a special day with captain Demetres and his boat. Demetres showed us many hidden beauties of Skiathos that you can only reach by boat. He was very kind and friendly with us and the best guide of the island. He positively surprised us with lots of fresh fruits and aperitifs. At Lalaria beach he served us the freshest sea urchins which he had just fished for us. It was an excellent day! We will definitely come back next summer for this trip with Demetres.

0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anaghi,August 2017,5,Best boat trip,"We went out on a tour of the island and on a fishing trip with Captain Dimitris last summer and it made our whole trip. The Captain had a keen eye and made sure everyone had a good time. He was a wonderful host. One of us actually did not know how to swim and was afraid to go into deep water ,but the Captain made sure that he too spent time in the water so he took us to a beach where my friend could swim as well and not be afraid of the water being too deep.If you are in Skiathos and want to go on a boat ride to see beautiful landskapes and enjoy yourselves then I highly recommend you to contact Capitain Dimitris !"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickl255,June 2018,5,Thank you Captain Dimitri!,"We spent a week in Skiathos and the highlight of our trip was our day on Capt Dimitri’s boat.  He was an amazing host - bringing food for us and even swimming out a fruit platter to the private beach we anchored by.  We got a full tour of the coasts of skopelos - even seeing where Mama Mia was filmed!!! Our 5 yr old son still talks about his buddy Capt Dimitri and asks us to go again.  Without a doubt, will be contacting him again on our next trip to Greece.  "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bubblepenryn,June 2018,5,Great night out,"Booked a 4 hour evening trip (6-10) with Demetris. Short twenty minute trip begore we are fishing. Caught plenty of small fish whilst being supplied with food and drink. Not fir the serious angler looking for bugh fush but perfect for the novice or youngsters lookibg to feel the tug of fish in their line. Took fish we caught to a local taverna who cooked them up for us the following evening, for a minimal fee. Trip back in in the dark was great."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aquamarina2,September 2017,5,The Best day out ,"A fabulous day out fishing with Dimitris on his own boat. We caught 98 fish between 7 people which was excellent and was shared out at the end of the trip. Needless to say we had to give it to one of the tavernas in return for a very cheap dinner. This is a great day out for anybody, couples and families alike.Stopping off for a swim and also lunch. I would love to do it again on another visit to Skiathos "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louiseaL9506RT,May 2018,5,Best fishing trip ever,"Just came back from a vacation on Skiathos and  Skopelos. Lots of beautiful beaches and scenery. Among many things we (family of 4) went on a fishing trip with Dimitris. It was by far our best experience on Skiathos. Dimitris showed us many hidden “gems” that you can only reach by boat. The kiddos enjoyed the swims and they were ecstatic about the fish they caught. Dimitris is so great and fantastic with kids as well and he is all the time just really cool and relaxed. Totally service. All we needed was on board the boat. We had a FANTASTIC trip and if I can totally recommend this trip to everyone, fishing or not. This captain is great and will show you the best of the islands. We’ll definitely come back for another trip."

In our trip we visited the most well-known beaches in Skiathos north-area but also the less touristic and accessible areas (e.g. caves, beaches, rocks), thanks to the experience of the boat master Dimitris.Dimitris prepared for us an afternoon break with fresh fruit in lalaria beach, and a Sunset aperitivo with fresh sea urchins (which he fished in the morning for us) and white wine ... a beautiful experience in a faboulus island."

4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrMZR,May 2016,5,Great family day out!,Captain Dimitris and his crew were fab! We spent the morning out fishing off Skopelos island and caught loads of 'kolios' fish. Our 6 year old son had never caught a fish before and was supper excited! We all had a go and it was really fun. After a bite of lunch we were off to the island of Tsoungria with its crystal clear & shallow waters for a leasurely dip and a really relaxing afternoon was had by all. Would most definitely recommend!

2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mummyduck1963,May 2016,5,Superb experience ,"Privately hired this boat for an evening fishing trip for myself, my wife & my 8yr old son, from beginning to end it was fantastic! Both owners where so helpful & nothing was too much trouble. We caught plenty of diff variety fish & watching the sunset was to die for! We ended up fishing in completed  darkness so on our return journey just sittin watching the stars & then all the towns lights appearing was magical. Cannot recommend this trip & was a perfect end to our perfect holiday!"
