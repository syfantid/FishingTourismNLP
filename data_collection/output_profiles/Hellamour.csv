Highlight of our vacation,"We booked a morning/afternoon fishing tour at Zante Fishing Tours. We were in contact with the owner (Georgios) a couple of days before the tour and we were given prompt instructions on departure time, the program of the tour etc. We arrived too early on the day of the tour (approx. 40 min earlier) but were greeted very very friendly by Georgios and his crew.

As we waited for the other guests to arrive we were given a nice cup of greek coffee and homemade breakfast sweets. As we took off to our first destination, Georgios explained to us the basics of fishing. Being newbee to fishing, it was really nice to listen to the explanation and techniques used during fishing. After the explanation, the fishing nets were put out in the sea and we left for a great swim near a deserted island. The water here was so nice and great for snorkling. We were provided with some refreshing fruits after the swim.

We continued our trip by pulling our the fishing nets from the sea and looking at out catch. It was really nice to experience fishing so closely - Georgios’ his crew was also very nice and provided us with instructions on which fish we could touch (and which not because of the poison), and we were even allowed to pull out the fish from the fishing nets ourselves (this was so much fun)

We took a second swim at the Porto Azurro beach - which is a beach where you can cover your whole body and face in a clay mask. Straight from the sea, it does not get any purer than that! It was a great experience and added a lot to our trip.

After being completely worn out after the swimming sessions, we got back on the boat around 3 o clock PM to a delicious late lunch made from a.o. the fish we catched from the sea. The food was prepared by Georgios’ his mother in law who was with us with the day, it tasted delicious!! Also, Georgios’ his lovely wife and daughter joined us during the trip, as the tour was on a Sunday they were helping out.

In summary: this was te highlight of our vacation in Zakynthos. Would not have want to missed out on this experience at all - it was truly perfect, from the food to the program to the music on the boat. The hospitality of Georgios and his family is major and this created the great atmosphere during the whole trip. We had so much fun, a big THANK YOU to Georgios and his family for providing us with this epic experience!!!",Date of experience: August 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
