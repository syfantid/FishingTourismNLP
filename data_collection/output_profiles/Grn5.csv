No meal at the inn,"I visited this establishment for a celebratory meal on Saturday the 25th June 2016 although the surroundings were up to 5☆ standard the service was worse than appalling. Even though the waitress returned to check the order they still managed to bring an incorrect dish. Resulting in starters being eaten at separate times. 1 hour 40 mins later one main turned up 10mins later 2 others turned up. 1 without sauce. The first was sent back to be reheated. Drinks were ordered and never appeared. That's only half of it.
I will say all the time the waitresses were very apologetic.
What really sticks in the gullet is the fact that one of the party has contacted the establishment via email and although promises were made to look into the matter nothing has been forthcoming.
5☆ I think the AA need a rethink",Date of stay: June 2016,The Inn at Brough,1,"Brough, United Kingdom"
