Fantastic day aboard Niko's boat!!,"We enjoyed every minute of our day long cruise aboard Niko's fishing boat. He, his wife, and crew, kept us well fed as we stopped at countless coves along the islands. We caught fish in the morning, and enjoyed them for lunch in the afternoon. Our trip exceeded all expectations! We'll never forget this day. Amazing!",Date of experience: October 2019,Milos Fishing Experience,5,"Milos, Greece"
