Great food & and people,"Due to the warm welcome from Teresa, her husband and staff at Porto Helis (close to Barbara's Studios) plus the great atmosphere and delicious traditional Greek food, we became regulars during our two week holiday in Svoronata. The gyros pittas, souvalaki and sausage were delicious and came served with lovely soft breads, tzadziki, salad and chips plus the food served to other customers also looked tasty and nicely presented too. The white and rose wine at €4.50 for a ½ litre carafe went down a treat as did our favourite Greek beer, Vab. The food is freshly cooked so if the restaurant is busy food can take a little longer to arrive, but it's definitely worth the wait. The portions are very generous and exceptional value for money and when we return to Svoronata in September, Porto Helis will be our first stop. Say hello to Mrs Meow Meow if you call in.

An absolutely perfect day,"This trip was the highlight of our two week stay in Kefalonia. There aren't enough words to describe our day with Captain Michalis, Antonia, Hassan and little Nikki, so we recommend you experience it for yourselves.

Early on a beautiful clear morning we were warmly welcomed on board with delicious coffee and homemade cake while we sailed off across a turquoise sea to the nets, which had been cast the night before. It was breeding season for the dolphins so they had plundered all the fish rather than hunt for their own, but we didn't mind and we just sailed to the next nets. We watched Hassan bring in the nets with lobsters, spider crabs, squid, octopus and all kinds of fish, some of which we'd never seen before. The fish was prepared and cooked while we sailed to a beautiful, shallow cove, where you could swim or laze about on board, whatever you wished. Then a feast fit for a king was served to us along with Greek salad, potatoes, fresh bread and a choice of chilled wine or soft drinks. There was enough to feed an army and all 12 of us made the most of it. Late afternoon we sailed back to the little port all agreeing what a fabulous day it had been and that it was worth every euro. Thank you again Michalis, Antonia, Hassan and little Nikki for an amazing experience. We look forward to sailing with you again, hopefully in September. Marie & Pete.

Great coffee & teacake,"We popped in here for the first time this morning after a stroll along the prom. We were welcomed and served by lovely lady with a perfect cup of coffee and a teacake with real butter, for just £2.75 each. The cafe is nicely decorated and spotless and the menu tempting and reasonably priced. All the cakes on display looked delicious so we'll just have to pop in regularly to try them all. We'll definitely make this cafe a regular stop from now on. They also serve breakfast and Sunday lunch so we'll have to try these too.",Date of visit: February 2019,Indulgence Cafe,4,"Llandudno, United Kingdom"
A very enjoyable experience.,"We decided to have lunch here due to recommendations from friends. We were given a warm welcome by a gentleman called Stephan and shown to a window table with lovely views of the Conwy estuary and castle. Stephan talked us through the set lunch menu and the main menu and recommended dishes according to our tastes and both the starters and mains were beautifully presented and tasted delicious. I had the chicken skewers with soy sauce and the steamed king prawn with garlic and onion and my partner had the crispy seafood pancakes and fillet of beef with brandy and chilli sauce . We couldn't find fault with the the service, food or, wine (a lovely sauvignon blanc) and will definitely return in the near future. Thank you Stephan.",Date of visit: December 2018,Nikki Ip's,4,"Deganwy, United Kingdom"
A Perfect Studio in a Fantastic City,"We both had such a wonderful time staying at Veronika's cozy studio. Veronika's communication was excellent from the first communication to the last and she was so helpful in arranging taxis for us when required. The instructions sent to us beforehand, to access the key and gain entry to the studio, were easy to follow and we felt very secure both when in and out of the flat.

It was really cold outside but the studio was like a little nest when we got back from our wonderful sightseeing trips. The street outside was busy but we both slept really well on the very comfortable, king size bed and with the studio being at the rear of the building, it was lovely and quiet. There is everything you need to prepare meals and there's also a convenience store close by, but if you prefer, there are amazing restaurants just yards away. The area is teaming with bars, attractions and beautiful scenery and is just a minute from the Charles bridge.
The studio, we both felt, is in one of the best locations in Prague - we just loved it.

There is also a really good shower in the flat with constant supply of hot water and plenty of towels.

We will be returning to this very special city and will definitely book with Veronika again. Thank you Veronika.",Date of stay: March 2018,"Residence Mostecka,Tortuga",4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
Our favourite restaurant in Llandudno,"We've just had another great meal from this restaurant - a take away this time. Every meal over the years we've been going has been delicious and the staff are always friendly and attentive, without being intrusive, and whether we have a take out or eat in the food is fresh, hot and nicely presented. The restaurant has also had a make over and it looks really nice. Many thanks to all the staff.",Date of visit: November 2017,East,4,"Llandudno, United Kingdom"
The Veiled Christ - a true work of art,"This is just a small unattractive chapel from the outside which contains the most amazing works of art I've ever seen. Wow! When you enter, the noise and heat from the busy street outside just disappear. The central sculpture of Christ, draped in a fine veil, is truly exquisite and is said to be the finest sculpture in the world -this may well be true! There are other masterpieces around the chapel which are pretty amazing, as are the frescoes which adorn the walls and ceiling. Make sure to see the anatomical machines which are only accessible down narrow stairs. I can't remember the fee to enter but you won't be disappointed if you visit. Tickets are purchased from the office which is on the opposite corner and there may be a que to enter, so go early to avoid standing the heat of the sun.

First Taste of Naples,"We stayed at 196 Corso Giuseppe Garibaldi for 9 nights and absolutely loved the location. The kindness and consideration shown to us by Alessandro, the owner, was outstanding, right from the first correspondence to the last and thanks to all his tips and suggestions we had the most amazing holiday.

The main attractions and places of interest were around 10 to 20 minutes walk and as an older couple aged 59 & 65,and we found walking around no problem. There are lots of great bars, cafes, restaurants and shops in the vicinity and wherever we went we were always greeted with friendliness, plus a little curiosity. There's also a great outdoor market a few blocks away which we shopped at every day for our fruit, veg and meat (we loved it). Our poor attempt at speaking Italian was always greeted with a smile, wherever we went, (so don't be frightened of having a go).

The apartment is light and spacious with a big comfy bed, a well equipped kitchen and great shower - absolutely everything you need, It can be a little noisy at night, after all it's in the middle of the city, but we had ear plugs and we both slept like logs. We were sad to leave but I know that if we ever return to wonderful Naples we will be booking with Alessandro and Angela again.",Date of stay: September 2017,Family Suite up to 5 in Naples Center,4,"Naples, Italy"
Five Night Break,"From our first email enquiry to departure at the end of our holiday The Glassworks Apartment and Peter, the owner, couldn't be faulted. On arrival at apartment 1, Peter took the time to walk us through, answered all our queries, then left us to enjoy ourselves stating that we could contact him at any time should the need arise.

The apartment was immaculate and well equipped and situated minutes from restaurants, bars, shops, supermarkets and attractions and has a lift, though there are three steps at the entrance to the building. We really appreciated the tea, coffee, milk orange juice and biscuits that Peter supplied and found the bed comfortable and the shower excellent. Fortunately the apartment has good sound proofing as it is situated on a busy road so the noise didn't bother us at all.

We enjoyed our stay and will be booking with Peter again the next time we are in Lancaster.",Date of stay: June 2016,The Glassworks Apartments - Apartment 1,4,"Lancaster, United Kingdom"
Four Night Stay,"눉 A great one bedroom apartment though the mattress was a little uncomfortable - we just caught up with our sleep when we got home and we have booked ti stay again in December. The staff on reception were really pleasant and helpful. The apartment was modern, very clean and situated in a quiet area and just short a walk to all attractions, restaurants, shops and cafes, so couldn't wish for a better location.",Date of stay: June 2015,BASE Serviced Apartments Duke Street,4,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"
2 Night Stay,"About 28 members of my family (aged between 6 months and 63 years) stayed for two nights. All agreed that the rooms were spotless and the beds extremely comfortable. The lady on reception (Lynda) booked us all in and out and was really friendly and very professional, she was also a mine of information about the area and was a great help with directions and taxis. A few of us had breakfast and lunch at the Nags Head Pub next door, where there was plenty of choice on the menu. The food was very tasty, reasonably priced, with large portions and once again the staff were very friendly and attentive. Overall a great stay - we'll definitely stay there when we're next in the area.",Date of stay: May 2015,Premier Inn Huddersfield West hotel,4,"Huddersfield, United Kingdom"
Fantastic food,"Six of us booked a table hoping for a good meal, but what we got was an experience. The food is excellent with large portions and the nan breads were the biggest I've ever seen - and tasty with it. All six of us really enjoyed the food and ended up sharing everything because it was all so delicious. The men drank beer but us girls stuck to the house white, which we agreed was very nice and reasonably priced. The staff were friendly and attentive and nothing was too much trouble. We were visitors to the area and still can't get over how reasonably priced the whole meal was. We'll definitely return when next in the area for another feast.",Date of visit: May 2015,Mumbai Spice,4,"Huddersfield, United Kingdom"
Just Heaven,"Me and my hubby have just returned from a wonderful 2 week stay at Rhodes Apartments. We can’t praise Tango enough for the warm welcome and the attention given to ensure that we had our every need taken care of. The apartment is situated in a beautiful spot with fabulous views and is perfect for a relaxing holiday. Atika cleaned our apartment every day and changed the bedding every three days, sometimes adorning our bed with flowers and petals . There is a minimart next door for food essentials and a number of family run restaurants very close by. We prepared light meals on the two ring cooker at least once a day and dined at the apartment restaurant on quite a few occasions. The menu is varied and the food always freshly prepared by the chef to a high standard and every meal was delicious. The whole building is spotless and the pool area constantly checked and cleaned. It’s about a 10 minute stroll into town for cafés, shops and restaurants and a few minutes further on is the beach. We were so sad to leave but know we will definitely return. Many thanks Tolga and to all your staff for such a fantastic holiday and we wish you all the very best for your forthcoming marriage in November.",Date of stay: October 2013,Rhodes Apartments,4,"Icmeler, Turkey"
