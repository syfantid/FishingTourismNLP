Weekend in Bologna,"I Portici - Hotel Review

Overall lovely hotel. Staff predominantly lovely & helpful.

Pros
• Great location - 10 min walk from Piazza Maggiore.
• V clean & tidy
• Staff in the bar (Osteria Portici) are fantastic. Fabulous cocktails.
• Room turn down service - lovely touch
• Most staff engaged with very helpful & keen to help.
• A great selection of toiletries.

Cons

Nothing major - just a few niggles.

• Room too warm for the time of year. We had thought there may be AC (as advertised, and there was a control panel on the wall) but we were unable to affect the temperature. Had to ask twice for the heating to be turned off in our room.
• Room is described as soundproofed but we may have been unlucky as we did not find this to be the case. It is true that you cannot hear the traffic outside when the window is closed, however, we were able to hear people in the room next door using hairdryers. Unfortunately, we also had an extremely noisy family in the room above & could hear the children running around like a family of elephants. Staff did address this on the first day for us - after going down to reception to ask them to. This was not a straightforward request as one member of staff suggested it was a difficult request for them address.
• We were three adult women sharing a family room. The room was only set up with 2 coffee cups, 2 glasses & 2 peoples worth of toiletries. This was not a major problem as staff were happy to top us up, we just found it frustrating that we had to ask - as there were clearly 3 people staying in the room. Toiletries were not always replenished. We paid for 3 people for 3 nights, so feel that should be acknowledged.
• There is no light above the shower in room 405. We found this odd. The main light doesn’t quite provide enough light in the shower.
• The hairdryer is of little use if you have long hair.",Date of stay: November 2019,I Portici Hotel,1,"Bologna, Italy"
Great Location for London CBD,"This is my second stay at this hotel in 3 months. Whilst the rooms are fairly basic they are totally adequate for an overnight business trip.
Hotel location is superb!
Great transport links.
Easy access via City Thameslink to St Pancras - short walk to Euston. Easy access to several tube stations Blackfriars, St Paul’s & Mansion House.

Plenty of bars & restaurants within walking distance.

This hotel has a housekeeping cupboard on each floor - you may need to request an iron.
Cold bottled water available by lifts to refill.

I found the staff extremely friendly & helpful.
Complimentary Wine available between 5-6
Coffee machine in lounge during the day.

Breakfast varied & plentiful / excellent service.",Date of stay: September 2019,Club Quarters Hotel St. Paul's,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Lovely welcoming & friendly bar.,"Great cafe / bar serving light meals, snacks & deserts.
Gentle jazz playing in the background- super views.

WiFi available.
Fantastic spinach & feta pie & the most incredible home made Galatopita

Service was fantastic- Victor & Panos extremely hospitable & nothing too much trouble.

Friendly atmosphere & excellent view of harbour.",Date of visit: May 2019,Ikion Cafe,1,"Alonnisos, Greece"
Great local taverna,"Just returned from a weeks holiday in Steni Vala suffice to say I ate here each night. Great food & excellent friendly service.
Varied traditional menu - this is a local Greek Taverna serving a good selection of local dishes.

My favourite was definitely the Scorpion Fish cooked in lemon although the fried aubergine was simply delish! incredibly light & crispy! The aubergine dip amazing!
Each dish a joy!

Excellent.",Date of visit: May 2019,Tassia's Cooking,1,"Alonnisos, Greece"
Brilliant! Totaly Relaxing Trip,"I have just returned from a wonderful and very relaxing break in Alonnisos, in all honestly I didn't venture to far from the hotel as the wonderful bay of Steni Vala is only 6 minutes stroll away, there are 3 Tavernas one of which Tassia's is rated as number 4 on Trip Advisor due to not only the most delicious home made food but incredibly friendly service. IKION café is the next property playing gently jazz and also offering superb service, in a relaxed atmosphere with super views. Between 3-4 pm the sailing flotillas arrive and moor for the evening.

A couple of stoney beaches with clear water are no ore than 8 minutes walk away.

Back to 4 Epoches!
Huge thank you to George & Katerina & Anna who made me feel so welcome wonderful atmosphere.
The hotel is spotlessly clean, rooms have small hob and refrigerator, I was on the ground floor but a second floor room would allow for incredible sea views and sunsets!
Breakfast was plentiful and varied, Greek Yoghurt, Pastries Ham, Cheese etc Cereals together with hot options including back egg & sausages - enough for everyone. The roof-bar wasn't open during my stay but I sat reading on the terrace which was fantastic, with sea and bay views.
Small and friendly hotel - perfect for solo guests as very safe and welcoming.
The staff here cannot fail to ensure you have a wonderful trip.",Date of stay: May 2019,4 Epoches Hotel,1,"Alonnisos, Greece"
Superb welcome & great experience,"Enjoyed a great stay at the Royal London House on Tuesday 28th August.
Plenty of staff on hand to assist as soon as I walked through the door!

Each member of staff passing reached out & enquired if I need assistance!

Lovely room, spotlessly clean with high end technology and Nespresso machine, lovely biscuits. Fruit & Still Water.

Great nights sleep!

Next morning on leaving the hotel I was faced with torrential rain - on hailing a taxi the service from the staff on attendance by the door was exceptional not only did they run out of the hotel to ensure the taxi drove further along Finsbury Square they also held an umbrella for me ensuring I didn’t get wet!

My opinion overall is that this hotel strives to ensure that each guest has a great experience and the staff work as a team to make it happen.

Thank you.",Date of stay: September 2018,Montcalm Royal London House - City of London,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Good transport links,"We booked this hotel as didn’t wish to stay in a city or airport corporate hotel - good call if you wish to explore Luxembourg.
Hotel is only 5 mins from a local railway station & 10 mins from the bus stop. Regular service into city centre.
We took a taxi from the Airport due to arriving late at night - however this would be quite an easy transfer during the day.

Reasonable priced hotel.

Initially we were shown to a room on ground floor - however due to the close proximity to the restaurant - it was very noisy!
The hotel responded very quickly and moved us to superior room on the second floor.
Absolutely excellent customer service dealt with swiftly & efficiently.

The new room was fully equipped for self catering -there is a shared kitchen available to all guests with lockers and although far more upmarket than a hostel shares the same ethos.

Room very clean and modern but probably not the best layout - clinical.

No coffee facilities in the general rooms at the hotel you are able to purchase pods for 50 cents.

Overall good hotel - very friendly and helpful staff - excellent service.",Date of stay: December 2017,Hostellerie du Grunewald,1,"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg"
Great Location Friendly Staff,"Booked this hotel fairly last minute as meeting a friend who was staying in St Germain - great location as only 5 mins walk to Metro. As per the other reviews the reception service is fantastic - extremely helpful & pleasant nothing too much trouble. Small but very clean & comfortable rooms.
No coffee machine or drinks facility in the rooms - they have a Nespresso machine in reception that is complimentary but coffee must not be taken to the room. Sadly this is due to previous guests causing damage etc - shame as this would be my only criticism .
.
I took the Le Bus Direct from CDG to Gare Montparnasse and the hotel is 10 min walk. Ticket machine at Airport or pay on the bus. I got the at gate 14 Terminal 2TD very easy - made a stop at terminal one then left - transfer is about an hour subject to traffic and 17€. Bus stops at 3 locations. Gare Lyon Gare Montparnasse.

Took the metro all weekend - quick easy - buy 10 tickets for just under €15 - use also on the buses. They don’t appear to expire! Used some from two years ago.

I would stay again - very reasonably priced hotel - left more money to enjoy Paris!",Date of stay: November 2017,Hotel Le Royal Rive Gauche,1,"Paris, France"
Conference Stay,"Stayed here for 3 nights as part of a conference, extremely friendly hotel. Good atmosphere. I had room 224 which was large and spacious. Bed was comfortable. Very centrally located just off the M69. Lunch was of extremely good quality and varied. In terms of Conference Catering I do feel the standard of lunch provided was better than average.",Date of stay: October 2017,Jurys Inn Hinckley Island,1,"Hinckley, United Kingdom"
Very Remote - not for me,"Firstly let me say that these studios are very clean although basic.

Fairly limited in terms of kitchen equipment - although there is a small oven the two ring electric plate is nowhere near a plug socket - it's probably just adequate for breakfast or simply lunch on the terrace.

Showroom clean & water hot and plentiful.

Wifi - drove me nuts. Very intermittent and dependent on where about the phone was positioned in the room.

Small TV on the wall.

The studios are on two sites - we stayed in the lower building & the second floor rooms having the better view.

The nearest shops & restaurants are a good 25 minute walk up hill and along the main road. Walking boots & high viz jacket recommended!!

The main road doesn't have street lights & quite hairy walking back at night.

We feel - car or quad bike essential whilst staying here.

Kanali beach is probably the nearest - having parked the car a very steep climb down a rocky path awaits - even tougher on the way back!

Beach is quiet - beautiful clear water no beds just naturists! - also possible to walk along the beach to Lourdata for lunch.

Pool was huge with plenty of beds - no pool bar open -
Wifi available.

Overall in my opinion better places to stay nearer nearer civilisation.

Lots available in Lourdata.",Date of stay: September 2017,Afrato Village Apartments,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great light lunch.,"Popped into Captain Jerry's quite late in the day - 2.30 ish.

Friendly & attentive service great food - cool music .

Good location on beach front - decent house wine served in good sized wine glasses - which was a welcomed change!

Enjoyed our visit - thank you.",Date of visit: September 2017,Captain Jerry's,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Average Lunch,"We visited Casa de Blue on our first day in Kefalonia - not many places open for lunch in Trapezaki.

Moussaka & Greek Salad - plate of juicy olives.

The moussaka was only just warm - not the best.

Friendly service not the greatest food.",Date of visit: September 2017,Casa de Blue Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Absolutely Fabulous Days Fishing & Boat Trip - perfect day out at sea!,"Just returned from my first fishing boat trip - what a fabulous experience!

A great day out - well entertained; fed & watered together with great company.

The day starts with a welcomed hot drink & introduction to other guests - between four and ten can be accommodated - 6 aboard today!

First stop is to pull in the nets and discover what delights the ocean has provided,
you can either join in or merely observe the process. Identifying the catch and learning the rope techniques all part of the fun.
From here it's the first stop - a quiet bay to swim, snorkel or chat.
Lunch is then prepared from the trawl. Efi prepares restaurant quality fare -simple fresh and plentiful.
All of us absolutely delighted with lunch - compliments all round.
Produce is from their own garden - vegetables & fruits.

A sail around the coast to Poros and a leisurely return to shore.

We considered many day trips before tie one and delighted with the choice.

Wonderful - many thanks.",Date of experience: September 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Morning Coffee,"Drove across to Lixouri from Argostoli, parked up and called in here on spec for a drink.

Friendly service, good coffee, warm buttery croissant - delicious.

Clean loos & good wifi.",Date of visit: September 2017,V + S Corner,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fabulous Lunch,"Firstly let me say that this is a typical family run Greek taverna serving freshly cooked food. It is not a fine dining establishment.

Called in for lunch today and enjoyed the best house wine so far this trip! Which apparently they buy in large barrels we have assumed locally.

We ate Freshly cooked grilled sardines served with a small garnish of home cooked chips these were absolutely delicious typical of a simple lunch on a Greek island together with a large Greek salad.

We ate late afternoon, there were other diners and we found the atmosphere was very relaxing.

Table overlooking small harbour.

We shall definitively be back for an evening meal.",Date of visit: September 2017,Lithero Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
A lucky drop in!,"Arrived yesterday and after settling in and having a little mooch around headed closer to home for supper so to speak!

The young lady asked if we had booked - ah! the restaurant was fairly busy and couldn't accommodate us outside however she offered a choice of 2 tables which were both more than acceptable. First tip - ring and reserve a table in peak season.

The fairly typical Greek menu with lots of options - freshly cooked and of an extremely high quality.

We chose the trio of dips which contained humus and a gorgeous fresh tomato dip and a then a feta cheese dip - fabulous. The fried squid crisp and not greasy.
One of the best salads I've ever had - Gefiri - simple but exquisite.
The Sofigado cooked slowly but moist & flavoursome.

Whilst the restaurant was busy - the staff were very attentive & above all happy & amiable - great atmosphere

Generally we are not so lucky on the first night and will definitely be returning this week.

Thank you.",Date of visit: September 2017,Gefiri Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great French Bistrot in a very central location.,"Its very rare to find a superb restaurant so close to a main Gare! literally across the road from Cannes station is this wonderful restaurant. Traditional French Menu, freshly prepared, good sized portions and served with a warm friendly smile.

I was fortunate to join a party on Saturday night, we shared a platter of starters Foie Gras de canard mi-cuit toast Poilâne & Tartare de Saumon which was exceptional.being a - for me the main course was Magret de Canard entier sauce secrète - cooked to perfection and served as a complete meal - fennel - ratatouille timbale, potatoes - a huge plate and great value.

Good choice of Wines which are not overpriced and can be viewed on the website, Overall a fantastic restaurant that delivers high quality food at very good price.",Date of visit: June 2017,La Meissouniere,1,"Cannes, France"
Last minute booking - good location,"We arrived in Cannes late on Saturday afternoon and fortunately found that the Bleu Rivage had rooms available.

In a side street between the Carlton and Miramar - this hotel has a great location for the joys of the Croisette.

Recently updated - Room 7 was clean and adequate. The staff are very welcoming - Lorenzo was especially keen to ensure that we were happy with the room - super service.
I would not recommend the annex standard rooms as they lacked freshness - perhaps damp. If looking for a cheap room with access to the beach and shops you can't go wrong. Not a luxury hotel but a reasonable cheap base.",Date of stay: June 2017,Hotel Bleu Rivage,1,"Cannes, France"
Superb Friendly Family Atmosphere,"I have just returned from a wonderful week on Skopelos staying at the Dionyssos.

Firstly the season doesn't really begin until the last week in May so we were very fortunate to be the first guests in the Hotel.. Skopelos was very quiet and a perfect time to go if looking for a peaceful : chilled: relaxed trip.

The hotel has a magnificent outdoor pool - from the terrace you have both coastal & lush green inland views.

Buffet breakfast is varied and plentiful - this can also be served in your room which is a fantastic bonus!

The general theme throughout this hotel is to ensure guests enjoy both their stay in the hotel & the maximise facilities.

Also the bar prices are very reasonable.

Thank you Yannis & the team!",Date of stay: May 2017,Hotel Dionyssos,1,"Skopelos, Greece"
Wonderful Day Trip,"I was very fortunate to join a sailing trip to Alonnisos with six other guests.

The weather was perfect - the company suburb.

Vasillis creates a very relaxed atmosphere - this was my first sailing experience and absolutely loved it.
Anyone considering a sailing trip should share the experience with Vasilis & Pirati (the cutest dog ever)

Peaceful chilled & totally relaxing - we stopped at beautiful scenic bays to swim in crystal clear waters then lunched in Alonnisos town.
Following lunch we took a taxi to the old town views of which was stunning!
& the orange cake sublime.",Date of experience: May 2017,Aegeo Sailing,1,"Skopelos, Greece"
Poor,"Took the bus to Stafilos Beach and to be honest very disappointed!
Early in the season but the beach was grubby and nothing of particular interest there.

Large ants.",Date of experience: May 2017,Stafilos Beach,1,"Skopelos, Greece"
Traditional Bar,"Very traditional Belgium Bar - no wifi no English Menu!
Warm atmosphere, wholesome menu lots of character.
Very authentic, hops hanging from ceiling, made a change from the bars in the main square.
No frills - local vibe.
We loved it.",Date of visit: December 2016,De Windmolen,1,"Bruges, Belgium"
Super Friendly Bar near the Windmills.,"Taking a stroll out of the town towards the windmills we stumbled upon this lovely bar restaurant. Delightful. Great Service,
warmth,
free wifi,
delightful staff
variety of wine available if had enough beer!",Date of visit: December 2016,De Verloren Hoek,1,"Bruges, Belgium"
Fantastic Service,"Just returned from a four day break on Guernsey.
As a solo traveller I thought it would be a good idea to hire a bike and explore the island.
Pre-booked an electric bike for a couple of days and THE best decision ever!
The warmth & level helpful service at Millards is amazing - the bike was also awesome - Bosch technology no less!
Totally recommend and I will definitely return and hire again.",Date of experience: September 2016,"Millard and Co, Scooter Rentals",1,"Guernsey, United Kingdom"
Traditional Guest House,"Firstly it’s important to understand and appreciate that accommodation in Guernsey is fairly expensive, what you have here is a very reasonably priced B&B - St Georges is situated on a main road, and any sea facing rooms will be noisy - I found the location, which is a good 10 minute walk into town perfect, the walk is along the sea wall and passes the Marina, plenty of coffee stops. - However there is a bus stop outside and the fare £1.00 per trip.
I found all staff to be really very helpful and am genuinely quite surprised by other reviews.
There are 21 rooms and in order to provide a smooth breakfast sitting, guests are requested to pre-order hot food the evening before, which again I didn't find a problem, everything was of a good quality and plentiful.
My initial room was a single quite small and noisy but very clean, I am realistic to accept that if you choose a low cost room then accept the consequences. Second night I had sea view double which was really pleasant - OK the TV was small I didn't travel to Guernsey to watch TV and was perfect for my needs.
St George's offer guests B&B - this isn't a five star hotel and I would suggest guests be realistic.
Overall - a very reasonably priced B&B and I would have no hesitation in staying there again subject to availability as often fully booked.
A thank you to all the staff who definitely went the extra mile and made my stay very pleasant.
Tips - Hire an Electric Bike from Millard’s (again staff here are amazingly helpful) and explore the island - 20 minute walk there or catch the bus - a must is Le Petite Cafe - express lunch great value..
I tended to have a splendid lunch out and then grabbed a sandwich / meal deal at the Co-op on the way back to hotel.
Pub - Le Piette Hotel Bar two doors away has a good local crowd.
Trip to Herm Island is essential – 2o minutes on the ferry and £13.00 return – fabulous walks along the coastal paths.",Date of stay: September 2016,St Georges,1,"Guernsey, United Kingdom"
Lunch,"I called in without reservation to partake in the 'Express Lunch' / Le Petit Cafe - this is situated next door!

Fabulous. Very French & excellent value! Total £12.50 for a Sirloin Steak Salad, glass of wine & cappuccino. Happy days!

Vey small busy cafe, laid back approach - pleasant staff.

Would highly recommend.",Date of visit: September 2016,Le Petit Bistro,1,"Guernsey, United Kingdom"
Quick Overnight Base,"The hotel is well located and easily accessible from the motorway and main routes.
New hotel very clean and minimalistic. Bathroom was compact but really very pleasant - only fault bring that the shower not very powerful.

Extremely comfortable beds and good linen.

Limited choice in hotel bar - but this is a very similar model to Holiday Inn Express - so to be expected.

Breakfast for me was a little chaotic although quality was quite good and plentiful.

Overall a good stop over.

We used as a base for lunch at Le Manoir QS - just need to book a taxi!",Date of stay: September 2016,Hampton by Hilton Oxford Hotel,1,"Oxford, United Kingdom"
Never fails to deliver!,"This has now become an annual pilgrimage - lunch at Manoir!

A totally wonderful treat for any occasion. We choose the 5 course tasting menu with a shared cheese plate and take all afternoon to enjoy the beauty and warm ambiance of the surroundings.

Here the staff deliver on every level - professional attentive and above all determined to ensure that every dining experience lives up to expectations.

LMQS isn't just about food - which as you would expect is fantastic but also about the delivery. From the initial pre lunch canapés, followed by the knowledge of the sommelier, vast assortment of freshly baked bread the day moves on at your pace!
Thank you once again - perfect way to spend an afternoon.",Date of stay: September 2016,Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons,1,"Great Milton, United Kingdom"
So good we ate there twice!!,"Just finished our second meal of the weekend at The Dining Room - originally unable to book a Saturday night table so went Friday night.
Wow!

A very small bijou restaurant serving incredible food.

Locally caught fish & crab, amazing Welsh Lamb and inspiring flavour combinations - what a great chef!

The Lamb with Cockles and Nefyn cider, is better than any lamb we have eaten before! We were blown away!

Service was warm & friendly - table is yours for the evening as only one sitting.

Pricing is spot on for the quality of produce, service, presentation and above all the talent of the chef!

Already looking forward to our next trip to Abersoch, and visiting The Dining Room again.

What a jewel in the crown of North Wales!",Date of visit: August 2016,The Dining Room,1,"Abersoch, United Kingdom"
Very dated accommodation,"I booked this room very last minute as usually happy with the Travellodge formula for a quick overnight base.
The young lady on reception was absolutely excellent - in fact couldn't have been more helpful curtious and efficient - she helped me carry luggage to my room as no lift - total star.
No onsite restaurant facility just a MacDonalds & petrol station Spar, although a local Gastro pub was suggested when I asked if anything nearby.
** my tip would be drive five minutes into Alcester to Waitrose - whilst no hot food available at least cold cuts salad and good wine! Also on that site are a variety of takeaway food options.
Sadly my room 213 was fairly noisy - with lots of slamming of doors - and unless curtains closed then guests walking down the passage can view into the room.

Overall I thought not really up to scratch for a business traveller.
But huge thanks to the most charming happy and very helpful receptionist - perfect welcome.",Date of stay: July 2016,Travelodge Stratford Alcester,1,"Alcester, United Kingdom"
No internet in rooms,"Just returned from a wedding in Plympton - I flew into Exeter the evening before - this hotel is literally just off the A38 - therefore extremely well located as a stopping point for anyone travelling.

Staff extremely pleasant, courteous & helpful.

The rooms are very tired and dated - bathroom small - only a hand basin in the bathroom of room 10. - carpet has seen better days

However clean and comfortable - had a great nights sleep- the close proximity to the A38 wasn't an issue . The shower was powerful enough in the morning and whilst I chose a late shower - plenty of hot water in the new block.

My only criticism would be lack of working internet in bedrooms - and if advertised should be available.
Internet is strong in the reception
area but if wishing to catch up on work emails or plan day from room
despite reception rebooting router no access - which is a fairly common comment from other reviewers and still an issue!

Overall a motel stop which was low budget and served its purpose.

There is a large Tesco Extra within 10 minutes which I found most useful - 24 hours and easily accessible in both directions.",Date of stay: May 2016,The Smithaleigh,1,"Plympton, United Kingdom"

Lovely Location Yacht Club,"We stopped off at the entrance to Port St Charles merely to take in the location & view.
Had a look of Port Grimoud and we were curious!

After enquiringly at the gatehouse we were directed to the Yacht Club / Restaurant - fabulous position,

We ordered four refreshing beers - in a glorious location - just under 40 BD. fabulous service and well worth a stop.",Date of stay: April 2016,Port St. Charles,1,Barbados
Special Birthday Celebration,"The moment you arrive at The Cliff it's a warm friendly welcome!
Contrary to some other reviews - we rocked up in a low budget rental car the passenger door opened by a lovely man with a huge smile & courteous manner.

This restaurant has immediate impact due to the incredible location - sure it is very expensive but you do get what you pay for!

Attentive staff - incredible food - great views - I don't find it pretentious - warm relaxed atmosphere, it's a destination place that never fails to deliver.

The booking service excellent - despite almost seven weeks in advance - waterside wasn't available but this was made clear at the time and another date offered! - however as birthday meal booked the available table which was fine.

Emails sent confirming dress code and anticipated costs! - perfect!

Thanks for another great night.",Date of visit: April 2016,The Cliff,1,Barbados
Mid-Week break,"Firstly we chose a poor day to travel - A55 closed due to chemical spillage and the journey was horrific - uncertain of our arrival time we called ahead and Debbie couldn't have been more accommodating and took any check in concerns away immediately - she left a key and welcome note.
The guest house is located just a five minute walk from the main thoroughfare of bars restaurants and shops, we parked the car and left it for the duration - perfect!
We stayed in room two which comprises both double and single beds, with small but perfectly acceptable en-suite -room, was spotless and comfortable.
The main reason for my review was the standard of the breakfast - Buffet bar for cereals, grapefruit, juices & yogurts - then a superb Full English using quality ingredients, excellent food served by smiling happy staff.

Debbie & Steve are lovely, helpful hosts who regularly welcome back guests - we shall definitely return.",Date of stay: March 2016,The Wylfa,1,"Abersoch, United Kingdom"
Over hyped,"Total disappointment - booked for late lunch / sure views are excellent .
Food is mediocre and service below standard.

Best welcome / service ever,"We visited on Saturday 7th November lunch very wet & wild day! The first welcome was at the door - shown swiftly to a table and attended immediately . Practically every member of staff checked on the table to ensure service and then asked how we found the food. It was excellent. To be fair we ate brunch and although 3 very different plates -all 3 excellent.
Very good food / service / happy staff.

Excellent Staff,"Stayed here for two nights as part of a work conference.
The staff are incredible - from reception/ bar/ conference room /restaurant nothing was too much trouble all requests met with a smile and a desire to assist- a credit to the industry.

Restaurant Food of a high standard, my only comment would be that the drinks are expensive. Large Red Wine was £11.00.
Comfortable bed, perhaps the overall decor slightly dated - but in the whole scheme of things a good venue .",Date of stay: October 2013,Macdonald Ansty Hall,1,"Coventry, United Kingdom"
"A little gem, that allowed in Daisy!","After enjoying a Fish n Chip lunch and brisk walk round Whitby, we needed afternoon tea and cake to warm up and relax..

We spotted Sherlocks earlier in the day, delicious home made chunky cakes in the window and olde world charm. To our delight they allowed us to bring in Daisy a very small and well behaved Shih Tzu.

Service was good, very pleasant happy staff a warm inviting place.
