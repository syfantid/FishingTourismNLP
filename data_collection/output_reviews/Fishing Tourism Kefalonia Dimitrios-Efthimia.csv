0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bardsey123,September 2019,5,A magical day!,"An absolute must for anyone visiting Kephalonia even if you are not into fishing! Efi, Dimitrios and Mohammed are fantastic people who went out of their way to make every part of our trip enjoyable. Greeted with coffee, tea and pastries we set off to sail down the coast. We watched the hauling in of the fishing nets and the preparation of the fish, drinking refreshing tasty home made lemonade. We then had a swim in a beautiful bay before sailing further down the coast for another swim whilst Efi cooked the fish and prepared lunch. The highlight of this second swim was dipping into a pool of clay at the end of the beach and covering ourselves in this elixir of youth!! We all swore we looked 10 years younger afterwards!!! The very best part of the day came with the consumption of beautifully cooked fish with salad, potatoes and bread washed down with really good home made red wine, bliss on a plate! The company was really convivial and it made for one of the best days of our holiday."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Greekaholics,September 2019,5,Great Day's Fishing and Swimming!,"We had a fabulous day with Dimitris and Efi. Helping to take fish from the nets, then 2 swimming stops, then a lovely lunch prepared by Efi from the fish caught plus salads and wine etc. This was one of the best days of our holiday in Katelios, Kefalonia. Thank you Dimitrios and Efi, and Mohammed the crew man."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ramallah123,September 2019,5,Best day of my holiday. Fishing and eating with great hosts,"Such a wonderful day spent with Efi, Dimitrios and Mohammed on their fishing cruise. The experience is one I shall never forget. Swimming in the small secluded bays. Great company. The fish we caught in the nets were the best fish I have ever eaten all cooked by Efi. Served with lemon potatoes and salad and washed down with red wine, beer or soft drinks. Our hosts were exceptional. I cannot wait until next year so I can do it all again. Thank you for the best day of my holiday. A*** all the way "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y1422ASsusank,September 2019,5,Magical Fishing Cruise,"Getting down with the locals...... Well, what a perfect day spent with the wonderful, charismatic Efi and husband Dimitrios.   Together with the fisherman of few words, Mohammed (but when he spoke, his words were kind and full of wisdom). It was magic watching him work those nets. It was a day of fun, wonder, relaxation and laughter, gently cruising the coastline of Kefalonia.  We stopped a few times to haul in the fishing nets and those who wanted to helped free the vast assortment of fish and crustaceans from the nets.  A real education for a complete novice like me.  So we continued, anchoring twice to swim in exotic coves that were almost inaccessible by land.Meanwhile,  Efi magically conjured up the most delicious  barbecued seafood feast, accompanied with local fresh salad and Efi’s secret recipe of buttery lemon potatoes.  Not to mention carafes of local wine and fresh fruit.....Amazing how sharing good food and a few glasses of wine can unite strangers into friendship, united by such a splendid experience!   Saying goodbye was hard.  The end of a memorable day, feeling very happy and content.  Very thankful to all three of our perfect hosts."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meeks81,September 2019,5,Amazing experience A*,"If you are looking for a boat trip with a difference look no further. This is an amazing experience for all ages. It’s a great experience to learn how to haul fishing nets in and about the array of fish caught. The day started with the most amazing cookies and coffee and a very friendly welcome.  Then it’s time to haul the nets, once all of the nets are in you stop of for a swim stop. while the fish are being cooked for lunch, which was amazing so tasty and the home brewed wine went down a treat.  Information about the different spots/places on the way which is a really nice touch. I really can’t rate this trip highly enough and if your wanting something different to the normal boat trips this is definitely for you.We received a lovely welcome and they couldn’t do enough for you. Will definitely be booking the trip again when we are back to this beautifulIsland."

We had a lovely day, a multitude of differnt fishes caught, and great Food. We enjoyed also the remote and quiet beaches we visited. We can heavily recomand this activity! Jennie and Michael"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JP134,September 2019,5,Good Catch ;-),We had so much fun spending the day on the fishing boat getting to know different sorts of fish while helping to get the fishes out of the nets.most of the fish we fished we Efi grilled and fried us and made us a amazing Lunch. We also stopped at two beaches where almost nobody was so cool.Too bad we haven't seen any seals or Dolphins or carettas but the animals have their own way of living so you can never know when or where they will appear. It was very relaxing to just enjoy the view of the neverending ocean and silence between. Thank you for a perfect last day on Kefalonia.
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sprow,September 2019,5,What a day ,"My wife and I met up with Efi and Dimitrious at the harbour lovely couple. My wife use a stick but it was not a problem she walked on fine. We were offered coffee tea or water with dry snacks which were very tasty. We set of to bring in the nets and hauled in lots of fish a big catch see photos. We then went to a place were the seals hung out but none there ((nature is not on demand) maybe next time we go? We then dropped of at our first cove for a swim beautiful beach, then on to the final beach which had clay which is claimed to knock 10 years of your age two of us did it twice but our wife’s looked disappointed when we swam back. Back board Ffi and Dimitrious had been busy cooking our fresh fish we caught with great salad, Greek potatoes lots of lovely fish wine and beer flowed there were four couple who never met before but we became friends. Efi and Dimitrious are great hosts and we will be back also we highly recommend this boat and crew Jackie and Paul xx"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ttzenos,September 2019,5,"A really unique boat trip, which is a must if you visit Kefalonia!","My wife and I took this trip on board Dimitris and Efi's boat last week and enjoyed it to the full. I cannot overemphasize how satisfied we were with everything offered in the course of the trip. The weather was so nice, the boat was comfortable and amazingly clean, the hosts were so caring, considerate, generous and ready to cater for our needs. They offered us breakfast when we boarded, despite not having promised to do so, to make us feel welcome. There were plenty of cold water, soft drinks, beers and wine on board and they constantly asked us whether we wanted some. In a little while everyone on board felt comfortable enough to help themselves to the fridge! The fishing experience was really cool. Efi and Mohamed (their assistant) were patient while taking the nets on board, to enable us to take part in untangling the fish ourselves and show us how to do that. Efi explained so many things about the different fishes caught and was so patient and eager to answer our questions. I should also stress that Efi did her best to explain everything in English, given that most on board were not Greek speakers, and did a very good job indeed. We also swam in marvelous secluded beaches with crystal clear water, inaccessible from land. My wife took a natural spa bath in a place where natural clay was available in shallow water. She loved it. And here comes the food!!!! Efi and Dimitris chose the best fish caught to prepare a feast for us. The grilled and fried fish was excellent, delicious and abundant. I love fish, so I ate lots of it. Everyone did, and there were leftovers. Dimitris and Efi were always there, attending to the table and ready to help us. And they served us their own wine (given the end of the season, their own wine was limited, so there was also great wine from other local producers available too), beers and soft drinks. Lots of them! The whole experience was incredible, interesting and fantastic, not boring at all. We had such a great time so we want to thank Dimitris and Efi for their kind-heartedness and generosity and wish them all the best! If you visit Kefalonia, do not miss this trip!!!!! It is a must!!!!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Destination734599,September 2019,5,Wonderful day out!,"This was a belated birthday treat for my husband for his 60th and we both loved it. Nothing was too much trouble from start to finish, Efi's English is excellent and was so knowledgeable about the different kinds of fish, and all three of them were so friendly and jolly.After first getting to know the other passengers over coffee, tea and biscuits we set sail to the first of two areas where the nets were waiting to be brought aboard and you could help as little or as much as you wanted, it was great fun.We stopped at two small beaches which could only be reached by boat and the water was so clear and a beautiful turquoise. You could get off the boat and swim if you wanted to and at the second stop you could swim ashore and cover yourselves in the liquid clay which Efi told us would take 10 years off our husbands, this bit she was telling fibs about!!!!!.During this time they cooked the fish they had caught and then laid the table with it plus potato dishes, salad and bread and home produced wine or beer, cold drinks and water.It was such a great day with good company and wonderful hosts. We would definitely do it again."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/199chrise,September 2019,5,Fishing like never before,This was an absolute treasure of a day.  I Was assisted on board by the lovely Efi and Demitriou as I am a bit small and stiff.  Coffee and tea were offered before we set out.   First to fishing nets where we helped take the fish from the nets to put aside for lunch.  Efi explained about the nets and the type of fish we'd caught and then we headed to a cove for a swim while lunch was prepped for us.  Another cove for a swim and a clay bath them back to the boat for lunch and it was absolutely delicious.  relaxation time before heading back to port. Efi produced lovely home made lemonade.  I could not recommend this tour enough.  Thanks to all the crew 
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rubymatthias123,September 2019,5,Fab day out!,"Thanks so much! We had a great time this morning. Efi went out of her way to help us at every point, even offering to book us a ride back to Agostoli with her friend afterwards as we had no transport. The day was amazing and the food delicious. We would love to come back again and would recommend to anyone. 11/10 x"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellecawley,September 2019,5,Absolutely superb fishing trip,"Fishing Cruises Kefalonia ""Dimitrios-Efthimia a huge thank you for a fantastic day. The family had an amazing day and the dog loved every minute.You guys are wonderful hosts, very accommodating to our requests of bringing our dog and the baby.The food was beautiful, wine and beers flowing all day as well as all refreshments.Our Private trip was very affordable,  I would highly recommend this to everyone wanting to do something special and a little different.See you guys again next year."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pengini9,September 2019,5,A Perfect Day on the Beautiful Ionian!,Our extended family group of 10- ages 3 to 69- thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful boat trip. Efi & Dimitri were lovely warm hosts. Lots of fish caught in the nets which young and old were delighted to watch come in. The secluded swimming spot we were taken to was paradise on earth. Our catch was perfectly cooked- absolutely delicious with plenty of food (and drink) to go around. We will remember this day for many years to come. Highly recommended!
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albasharp,September 2019,3,Not value for money....,"Positive points:Interesting to see real fishermen/woman at work and see net fishing techniquesHosts very friendly but only the lady speaks English so hard to communicate and ask questions of other hostsBoat was very clean and organisedAll kinds of fish are caught including: flying fish, lobster, calamari, crabs, barracuda, sea bass, scorpion fish and many more!Negative points:You board boat early at 08.00 and you are greeted to a jug of hot water and instant coffee with dried breadsticks and very dry biscuits- I think decent coffee and cake is more appropriate to the price paid.A bit boring watching and helping to bring the fish in as it takes time to release from nets could be made more interesting by imparting knowledge of the fish etcI saw photos on TripAdvisor of calamari and lobster with pasta served for lunch which looked delicious and encouraged me to book but reality is that they choose the fish you get to eat which in our case was a small offering for the 12-people in the boat and no sign of the calamari or various other fish which were caught. Seemed like they were set aside to sell in the restaurants and we just got a meagre portion. The two lobsters we did catch were cooked and split in four and looked delicious but they decided to pull straws for who got them and would have been much fairer to give each of the four families onboard one half each. We didn’t even get to pull a straw never mind taste it! No wine was served in the boat and we were told they had finished it as they produce their own and it was the end of the season so there was non left-not acceptable if you are selling it as part of your excursion, particularly if you don’t drink beer? It should have been replaced by the local robola wine from one of the Kefalonian wineries and explained that they had run out but it was a good local substitute.When eating and deboning fresh fish one needs a knife. You are given only a fork so hot fish straight off the grill and no knife is not easy to eat! Drinks are VERY limited and hidden away somewhere so that you need to ask for them. They should have done a briefing at the start of the day to explain where drinks were so that people felt comfortable and at ease in drinking what they wanted. I drank a glass of lemonade and a water all day long.You are taken to a few bays but there isn’t really anything to do other than swim and they make it quite clear when it’s time to prepare lunch that they want you off the boat til it’s ready. It would be a good idea to invest in some paddle boards and flippers so that you can go off and explore in the caves when you’re kicked off the boat.All in all I left feeling VERY ripped off and not really able to say anything about it as it would ruin our day...hence I hope they read this and use it constructively to enhance what they are currently offering. I would value that experience at a maximum of €40 for what we experienced and sadly would never recommend it to anyone. For a couple it cost €150 and I feel that is taking the mikey really."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D4954AKpaulb,August 2019,3,Nice trip but expensive,"Positives:Lovely hostsShort boat trip Experience traditional Greek fishing boatGood variety of fish caughtHosts knowledge of the fishSwim and mud spaGreat food made with lots of homegrown produceNegatives:Following part of their working day-bringing on 2 very long nets.Not compulsory to help untangling fish from net, but this part takes a long time and a little tedious.Only 12 cans of beer on the boat, no wine(plenty of water).Longlines can be used but only if you bring your own!  I’m on holiday mine is at home.Snorkels and masks provided but first beach is long straight with only pebbles of various sizes, no fish or anything of interest to see.A few in the group don’t eat much fish normally and not familiar with while fish.  Struggled de-boning the fish at dinner.Unfortunate for us:Didn’t see any seals, dolphins or turtles.Overall:Some good moments but a bit dull at times.  At 75euro It felt very expensive for what we experienced. "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SWnick68,August 2019,5,Wonderful day that makes you 10 years younger,"We can't recommend a day out with Efi and Dimitrios highly enough. We helped bring in the catch of parrot fish, crayfish, barracuda, mullet and cuttlefish fish before sea swimming at remote bays and covering ourselves in clay from a natural spring to get 10 years younger!! The huge lunch of freshly cooked fish, wonderful salads and ice cold beer soon puts the years back on again before heading home after a truly memorable day which the boys declared as the best of the holiday.Thank you both so much Efi and Dimitrios x"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDM41,August 2019,5,Hard to think how it could have been better....,"We went out last Tuesday and had the best time; lovely hosts, good company interesting experiences and the most amazing fresh fish lunch it's possible to have anywhere I'd imagine....If every single review on TripAdvisor is 5 stars, that tells enough of a story in itself (and is amazingly rare), so I won't repeat what's been written previously as there's no need.Just thank you for a superb day that we won't forget x"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jilk2809,August 2019,5,A wonderful day out,"A day out with Effi&Dimi is a day I can recommend for everybody.You learn about Greek food, all the varieties of fish, help out with the nets and then Effi cooks them for you! And we vhere lucky not to only see seals but as we anchored close to them some passengers swam close to where we spotted them and then the seals came as close as 5 meters! It was a great day out!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenllewellyn315,August 2019,5,What a day!,"We have just spent the day of Dimitris and Efi’s fishing boat. What a fabulous trip, we would highly recommend this experience. This is our 3rd visit to Kefalonia and by far the best thing we have done. Dimitris and Efi are such welcoming hosts and we were fortunate to have some lovely Italian fishing companions for the day. We got to see beautiful coastline and beaches only accessible by boat. After helping empty the fishing nets, we were taken to paradise beach and swam in the sea while Efi prepared a magnificent lunch with the catch of the day...so delicious!The trip is restricted to a maximum of 12 people so it feels very personal. If you are looking for a trip that is a little different and great value for money, then this is for you!"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M9905BZtraceys,August 2019,5,5 star fishing cruise ,"I highly recommend this fishing cruise, it was so good last year we returned & booked it again this year. It's a family run business with all home made foods at lunch, Effi cooks the fish that are caught everything tastes amazing. Beautiful people, beautiful cruise, beautiful food."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gillian248,August 2019,5,Reality of fishing,"A very educational trip. Ate fish I’d never even heard of (pork fish) and felt sorry for the stingrays and octopus that we caught as they also got sliced up and thrown into the pan.  Lovely hosts, excellent food, more than enough for everyone. You will catch loads of fish that will be cooked for your lunch and your hosts will make you very welcome."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebsWalsh,August 2019,5,Superb - 10/10!,"My family had the best experience on Dimitrios and Efi’s fishing boat out of Katelios. It was an absolute amazing trip and such an education for all ages! You can be hands on and get involved in untangling the fish from the nets, learning about all the different types of fish or sit back and enjoy the friendly atmosphere. Efi cooks a fabulous ocean to table dining experience which is simply delicious and the homemade wine is a real treat too! We also enjoyed a couple of swims along the way. Efi and Dimitrios are very welcoming and lovely hosts who go out of their way to make you happy. The other guests on the boat were so friendly and this trip was the highlight of our holiday - 10/10! Big thanks to the crew - we had a superb day and the memories will stay with us for ever xx"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelStewie,August 2019,5,BEST DAY EVER IN KEFALONIA!,"Where do we even begin. We have been on this trip with Efi, Dimitrious and their crew member Mohammed now for 3 years in a row! And each year we have enjoyed it more and more when we have thought this was impossible. This trip is fantastic for all ages with something for everyone. As they reel in the morning catch Efi is a fantastic teacher, explaining about each fish as they appear in the nets - and what a range of fish there are!! We have seen octopus, parrot fish, pork fish and fly fish just to name a few. Once the catch is in, you get to jump off the boat and into the amazing blue waters and enjoy a swim. On the second stop Dimitrious swam with us to the shore where he showed us natural clay, covering his head in it and then dipping the wet clay into small stones showing us his new hairdo leaving us all in fits of laughter. All whilst Efi and the crew are busy preparing a 5 star lunch from the catch of the day. Not only is the fish the MOST DELICIOUS fish we’ve had from our stay on the island, but it comes along with fresh tomatoes, and herbs from Efi and Dimitrious’ own garden along with homemade wine and lemonade! They make you feel so welcome and are the best hosts we could have asked for, from not knowing them before our trip 3 years ago to now calling them firm family friends! We can not recommend this trip highly enough and if you’re unsure just go for it - you will not regret it!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R7175OFmichelleb,August 2019,5,Memorable Day,"We live in Bournemouth and my husband is a keen fisherman so when we found this trip on the internet and read the reviews we knew we had to book it.Wow we weren’t disappointed.. from the minute we stepped foot on Efi & Dimitris boat we felt so welcome .. coffee and cakes and a spotlessly clean deck .. plentiful fish from the nets that had been put out the evening before and you had a chance to help with the catch ! Octopus,A flying fish ! Parrot fish,Red mullet (sweet to eat!) bream to name but a few .. homemade lemonade to die for .. off to several beaches where you can swim and then later a clay beach to cover yourself in cold clay (looking like a tribe from Pirates of The Caribbean ) but for me the highlight of the day was the lunch that follows the catch .. Efi is a superb host and can cook ! The lunch was some of the best tasting fish I have ever had and we eat a lot of fresh fish in our house .. drizzled with olive oil lemon and oregano fresh from the griddle ..warm potato salad fresh bread it’s worth going just for the lunch alone.. homemade wine and watermelon from the garden when sat in one of most beautiful parts of the world I’ve ever been to . The Ionian islands are stunningly beautiful.Truly such an amazing day from 8-3pm it’s such a good value day for all my family who loved every minute and we have already said we are going back to Kefalonia next year and will book to go back to see Efi & Dimitrios again.Everything was perfect ..If you are off to Kefalonia please please book this day out .. you will not be disappointed.Such fabulous hosts.Efi such a great passionate cook...Dimitrios superb skipper "
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mtbellini,August 2019,5,Outstanding!!!,"This was absolutely the highlight of our trip to kefalonia. Demetrios and Efi were very personable, friendly, and accommodating hosts and you felt as if they were long time friends. They put nets out the night before and as we sat on the boat we watched as they reeled in the fish that would soon be our meal on board! They were super knowledgeable about every fish they reeled in and took the time to explain every detail. They took us to remote places to swim (only reachable by boat) and we took full advantage of jumping off the boat while inhaling the delicious scents of freshly food cooking for us. This was a one of a kind experience that cannot be missed!! The home made wine, freshly cut salad were an added delight! I can personally say that my family and I will never forget this amazing experience and we will definitely be back next year!!!!!!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackieDean500,August 2019,5,WOW....BEST TRIP EVER !,"An amazing trip...Efi and the guys were so friendly you instantly felt like old friends. The boat is well equipped and impeccably clean. Coffee and cakes on arrival. Plenty of drinks for the day, and Efi's homemade lemonade is a must. Sorting the fish from the nets is as hands on as you want, the choice is yours. The food Efi produces, both the cooked fish and homemade salads is both delicious and plentiful. Scenery second to none and we stopped for leisurely breaks at 3 secluded beaches. An absolutely stunning day out, loved every minute."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MESal2013,August 2019,5,The Best!!,"Dimitrios and Efthimia, with the able assistance of Mohammed, gave us what was simply the best day of our holiday (and probably of many recent holidays).The warmest of hosts, everything they did and provided was first rate.With a boatload of lovely fellow guests, an amazing experience helping with the nets, beautiful beaches, crystal clear waters and incredible fresh food this was an amazing day we will always treasure and recommend. Well worth the 5:30 alarm and 6 a.m.start from Fiscardo. Thank you!!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmajZ6910MB,August 2019,5,Making memories. ,"Without doubt this was the most memorable day of an already amazing holiday. Efi and Demitrios made us all feel part of their family during our time on their boat. Nothing was too much trouble, they fed and watered us with the freshest possible ingredients (we had just taken the fish from the nets), watered us with their home made wine and answered every question as if it was the first time they’d been asked. The locations we went to were incredible. I’ve never been swimming in water that colour before!A very special day made even more special by the amazing crew. Thank you x"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bad_bleep,August 2019,5,"Been twice, WILL GO AGAIN!","I’ve been on this boat trip twice now with family and friends and I never intend to stop going on it! Each trip is so different and unique that it’s worth doing it over and over again. The trip starts with some coffee and tea on the boat, then we go and pull up the fishing nets. Then we find a nice exclusive bay and eat there! We went to two bays in the trip I did a couple days ago however, the first where we swam, and the second where we swam and ate our catch! The staff are very nice and warm and provide an amazing experience. Some people are out off by the fact it is a ‘fishing trip’. IT IS NOT!! Yes you do some fishing and pull up the nets but it is full of other activities as well! These include swimming and eating an amazing fresh lunch. I highly recommend as there is nothing else on the island that can beat this. Yes, go visit the Melissani caves... but this is far better. I cannot stress how great this trip is. "
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P8249UArichardm,August 2019,5,Fish-tastic!,We’ve been on plenty of great boat trips in the past but this is so much more. This is authentic fishing and you can either help or sit back and relax.  You get all the usual boat trip stuff ie amazing secluded swimming spots and plenty to drink but the cool bit is catching the fish and then Efthemika grills what you’ve caught that day. You don’t get fish any fresher! Highly recommend! Ps. All three of your hosts are so lovely too!
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beachhut2020,August 2019,5,Absolutely FABULOUS day!!,"From reading reviews prior to our holiday, this trip was a definite!! The very BEST boat trip!! 8am depart from the harbour returning around 3pm.... perfect day assisting bringing in the nets & helping (if you wanted to) remove the fish, returning some to the sea, learning the names from Efi & identifying the huge variety. Our 1st swim stop at the “mud bath” beach  (it didn’t provide eternal youth unfortunately) gave the crew time to prepare & cook our haul.... delicious, served with Efis salads & plentiful wine & beer!! Another swim stop after seal spotting & a cruise down the coast before return.... we can’t praise this high enough!! Dimitrios & Efi are amazing hosts & we’ll be back!!! "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendymaggs01,August 2019,5,Highly recommend; a must do experience,"If you are travelling to Kefalonia you must give this unique experience a go. Wonderful hosts, great food, chance to see the beautiful coastline off shore and swim in magnificent waters."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BecBatty,July 2019,5,Fishing trip,Fantastic trip with our boys aged 10 &  7 years old we were all made to feel welcome. The boys loved swimming in the sea and the lunch was simple delicious!

0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rsdfoodie,July 2019,5,Exceeded expectations!,"My son and I decided to try a fishing trip and it turned out to be the highlight of our holiday!When we arrived at the harbour, we were welcomed onboard the boat by the owners Dimitrios and Efthimia who gave us hot coffee and some lovely homemade biscuits. The boat was well appointed and obviously proudly maintained. There was plenty of room for the twelve guests onboard and the main deck was covered to give protection from the sun. There was a clean WC, a freshwater shower hose and wash taps for guest use.  We left the harbour and motored out to the first nets which had been set out the night before. As they were brought up we saw a huge variety of fish species of all sizes, shapes and colours We were encouraged to help remove them from the nets which was great fun - although not as easy as they made it look! By the time we collected the second net we had a bumper catch of wonderful fresh fish. Efi selected the best from our catch and set about cooking them. The larger fish were seasoned with salt and spicy wild oregano and griddled whole. The smaller fish were dusted with seasoned flower and fried in olive oil. She went on to make a fresh potato salad and Dimitrios made a salad of tomato, cucumber, sweet pepper and red onion - all home grown. Two magnums of homemade wine were taken off ice and we set about what I can only describe as a feast of some of the most delicious fish I have ever tasted!! After lunch Dimitrios took us to a secluded swim spot and we had a relax before heading back to the harbour, all of us full and content :-)If you are at all interested in fishing and good food, I can’t recommend this experience highly enough. Dimitrios and Efi were perfect hosts exceeding our expectations on every level !!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bones2025,July 2019,5,Boat trip unlike any other!,"Such a beautiful trip! All of the wonderful things you’ll read on here are absolutely true, it’s a really magical day! Do it if you get a chance!This was our second amazing trip with Efi and Dimitrios and we will be taking a third with them when we return next year for sure. We travelled as a family of 4 with 2 children who just loved watching to see what the catch that day contained as did we, it’s absolutely fascinating!Mohammad (the most patient, lovely, gentle man) spent a good hour with our children showing them how to get the fish out of the nets. He was just so gorgeous with the children as were Efi and Dimitrios as always! We all felt very relaxed and so well looked after. Nothing was too much trouble.Efi is the most amazing cook. It’s incredible to see what she can create on the boat. We ate some seriously delicious fish and were lucky enough to try some slipper lobster as there was one within the catch that day. We stopped at 2 really beautiful beaches for swimming and snorkelling and had a natural mud bath on one too. Thank you all for helping us make some wonderful holiday memories. See you in 2020.Jen and family xxx"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Global640546,July 2019,5,Boat trip,"What a great day!! A little fishing with the nets hauling in the catch, great local knowledge and genuine hospitality. Lots of swimming opportunities and hands on with the catch. Lovely crew always attentive to each passenger. Lovely to eat what was caught, fish has never been so fresh. More swimming in blue seas and a glimpse of a turtle on the way back. Superb day for anyone"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcsX5442UF,July 2019,5,Awesome day out,"We have just spent an awesome day with Dimitrios & Efthimia, we have had several boat trips during our visits to Kefalonia, this was by far the best we have been on. A working fishing boat, an early start out to the fishing grounds, bringing in the nets and seeing the catch, all explained by Efthimia a wide range of fish which you can help untangle from the nets then watch being prepared for lunch whilst having a leisurely swim and then the most amazing lunch, amazing potatoes and salad to accompany your catch, friendly, attentive and really genuine people. If you only have time for one boat trip, this is the one. AWESOME  "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1958PH,July 2019,5,Brilliant day out!,"What an amazing day out on the fishing boat with Effi, Dimitri and the ever busy Mohammad.The maximum of twelve guests makes it a comfortable experience in the boat, loads of room to sit and move around, coffee tea and nibbles upon arrival, and as required all day! In fact all food, soft drinks, wine and beer are available as part of the price, with the freshest fish for lunch that you will ever have the pleasure to eat.The fishing experience is a fascinating part of the day, the team pull the nets in and you can help remove the fish from the nets or sit back and watch the crew as they go about their work describing each type of fish as they pull them in.Three swim stops throughout the day in beautiful blue bays made this a fantastic day to remember.I look forward to returning next year and going out with the crew again.Highly recommended!!"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonathanXYZ,July 2019,5,Lovely relaxing day for the family,"Took my two teenage boys on the trip. They were fascinated by the extensive catch from the nets, all sorts of fish and seafood - including a flying fish, stingray, lobsters etc. We swam off the boat at a couple of beautiful beaches and enjoyed a wonderful meal. The hospitality was fantastic, very friendly and warm. Highly recommended!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Salmonman69,July 2019,5,TREATED LIKE FAMILY!!,"Dimitrios  and Efthimia  are wonderful hosts, very attentive to our needs and they made us feel like family on this beautiful boat with a toilet on board. This boat only takes 12 people max on a trip, My family of 7 with another family of 4, made this feel like a semi-private tour. They charge $75.00 Euros and is worth every penny. If you like to eat fresh seafood from your catch, it does not get any better or fresher than this, The lunch was outstanding, using tomatoes and herbs from their own private garden for Greek salad and potoes with olive oil from their olive trees, plus homemade white wine that puts Rebola to shame in my opinion.I would definately recommend this tour without any hesitation, as this will now be a tradition any other time we come to Kefelonia in the future.THANK YOU DIMITRIOS AND EFTHIMIA FOR A VERY MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE!!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/61JF2016,June 2019,5,Another fantastic trip!,"We had another fantastic trip with Efi and Dimitri (our third!). It's amazing to see the catch brought on board and if you want to you can help to untangle the fish from the nets. The swimming stops are always in beautiful locations and it's quite easy to get into the water and back on board again. I had a bad arm but still managed it! The lunch Efi prepares is the best fish you will ever taste and most of the other ingredients come from their garden, even the very good wine is from their grapes. Next time we are in Kefalonia we will definitely do this trip again - it's a lovely day out and Efi and Dimitri are now dear friends."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulRogan,July 2019,5,Fishing only part of the fun!!,"A wonderful day on board this boat, with fantastic hosts Dimitrios and Efi. The day started out with a cruise of only half an hour or so to where the nets were laid, then came the anticipation of seeing the nets hauled up and everyone mucking in to get the catch out of the net. Many different kinds of fish, slipper lobsters, cuttlefish and crabs were all hauled up, and Efi was really keen to point out any interesting specimens. The flying fish were especially colourful. After the catch was in, a short sail brought us to a small beach where you could go for a swim, or walk on the beach, making sure not to disturb the turtle nests which could be seen from the trails left up the beach by the female turtles hauling themselves out. Back on the boat then for a short sail to some caves where we were lucky to see the critically endangered Mediterranean Monk Seal, then on to the last beach for more swimming and mud baths, followed by a magnificent lunch of the fish that had been caught that morning with Efi's beautiful fresh salads and wine from their own grapes. After lunch, more swimming and then a slow cruise back to Katelios for the end of a great day.."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katiekX6012HR,July 2019,5,Fantastic fishing trip,"We had the best time out with these lovely people. Not only was the fishing experience fantastic for the kids and us, but Efi’s cooking was incredible! They are all so hospitable and friendly. ️ The swimming in the sea was amazing and the beaches truly beautiful. A fantastic family day out. If you like seafood, sun and swimming then this is the trip for you!!"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cona950,July 2019,5,Thank you so much!,"Our family had an amazing time on Dimitrios and Efi’s boat. It was a memorable experience to bring in live fish from the nets and then to participate in preparing them for a exquisite feast. I can still smell the aromas of the fish being cooked tempting us back into the boat soon after we jumped into the magical Ionian sea for a swim. When fish is this fresh, all you need is basic seasoning. Efi and Dimitrios actually collect their own salt and oregano from the island, which is another reason for the unbelievable taste. The white wine also made by Efi and Dimitrios was delicious and a perfect match with our food. I can go on and on about the food, but just as superb was the multiple stops along beautiful isolated beaches, including the opportunity to have some natural beauty therapy with the famous Kefalonian clay at one of the beaches. Finally, we can’t speak highly enough of Dimitrios, Efi and their crew member Muhammad. They are beautiful people, and took such great care of us all. It genuinely felt like we were a part of their family. We will always remember this day and hope to return again. Magical island, magical people, magical memories. Bravo Dimitrios and Efi for a brilliant set up. "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chriswright50,July 2019,5,Brilliant Day,"A fantastic experience we loved it, so will try to book for next Friday. Thoroughly recommend to anyone that fancies a day on a boat. Fish caught are cooked onboard for you"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairelE2854YL,July 2019,5,Always the highlight of our holidays 🐠🥂,"This is mine and my boyfriends second time on the fishing tour this year. I can honestly say I wouldn’t dream of visiting the island without taking this trip. It has been both years the absolute highlight of our holiday! Efi and Dimitrios greeted us as if we were old friends which was lovely. I was touched they had remembered us from the previous year. They are both clearly very hard working, smiley, genuinely nice people who are eager to please. I’m not- unlike my boyfriend hugely into fishing. That said I always very much enjoy this part of the trip. You can be as involved as you like helping untangle the fish from the nets or watch on there is no pressure! There were two young boys on the trip with  us aged around 10-12 who thoroughly enjoyed this part of the trip- a fantastic family tour as well as couples! Following the fishing we were taken over to a lovely beach which was all for us no one else there. There was even natural clay where you could give yourself a free spa treatment! Whilst we relaxed there and swam in the tranquil waters Efi & Dimitrios prepared us a lovely spot of lunch. Efi did not disappoint with her cooking skills. How she makes such sensational food on one little stove amazes me! She is an extremely talented cook. Definitely one of- if not the best meal we had during our holidays both years. Home made wine is always flowing, lots of beer or soft drinks for children including Efi’s delicious home made lemonade. On the way back we stopped and had one last swim (and lots more home made wine)Before docking back in Katelios harbour around 3pm. We look forward to seeing you both next year for another fabulous day out on the sea! Thankyou so much to you both! "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/419miket,July 2019,5,Fantastic Authentic Experience - Truly Special Family Memories,"We had a fantastic day, treated to a unique experience. As others have said, there are plenty of boat trips on Kefalonia and elsewhere. This offers something different. Dimitrios and Efi make you feel welcome, with smiles on their faces, from the first moment you step onto their lovely boat. Helping them bring in the catch is something very few people will get to experience, and gives you a great insight into the life of the new fishermen of the Mediterranean. A special mention too for Muhammad, hard working, the patience of a saint and all with a smile on his face. You can get involved as much or as lit as you want. Then plenty of time for swimming, snorkelling, sun bathing, chattering with newly made friends, and simply relaxing. Even a clay bath if you fancy it, go on - it promises to make you twenty years youngerMeanwhile Efi is cooking the most delicious lunch including a wonderful selection of fish fresh from our catch. Family holidays are all about memories. Thanks again to Dimitrios, Efi and Muhammad for giving us a day to remember. Mike, Lucy, Jack & Issy x"

She is also fussy about cleanliness and was very impressed with how clean the boat was and the care taken in preparing the food. Started with homemade lemonade and nibbles then watched the nets being hauled in with variety of fish.  D & E took time to show us the interesting fish. Visited two bays for snorkelling whilst fish was being prepared and cooked.Delicious spread of freshly cooked fish plus fresh salad, her own potato salad and homemade wine.  There was more food than we could eat!I would recommend this to almost anyone.  Perhaps too long if you have very young children."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gooner2018,July 2019,5,Fishing in Kateleios,"We had the most amazing day, welcomed with coffee and pastries, then set sail to gather in the nets, such an amazing experience, we cheered when we saw the first fish , which was followed by plenty more. Efi was so good explaining all about the fish, from snappers to lobster and making sure everyone was included. Off to the beach for a swim whilst the owners sorted the days catch. Home made lemonade . Then off to another beach  for pre lunch swim and then the most amazing food ever, and all prepared onboard. It was the best day of the holiday.  So many memories and laughs ️"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sallydicksonuk,July 2019,5,Amazing day!,"Highly recommend this trip! A warm and friendly welcome from Efi, Dimitrios and Muhammed. Coffee and sweet treats to start whilst meeting other passengers, then off to sea. Swim stops, seals, a clay pool, rod fishing, and bringing in the nets all part of a perfect day! Lunch was amazing- Efi cooked the fish we caught and provided salads and homemade wine - delicious! Will definitely book again ."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamc720,June 2019,5,Best Fishing Trip Ever!,"Spending the day with Efi and Dimitrios (not forgetting Mohammed) is the best day you will have on your holiday. As you make your way out to sea, you will get a lovely breakfast of tea/coffee and homemade biscuits/cakes..You'll not only learn how difficult being a fisherman is, but get to help bring in the catch for the day (if you want to), which is so much fun.Dimitrios cleans the catch and Efi then cooks it for lunch ( there is always so much left over). As well as the freshest fish you will ever have you will have homemade wine/ouzo/lemonade, plus beer, water and soft drinks. All the salads, potatoes, herbs and fruits are organic, grown by Efi and Dimitrios. It goes without saying that Efi's cooking is to die for!You will have swim stops at the most beautiful beaches/coves, accessable only by boat.This is no ordinary day out as Efi and Dimitrios are great company and truly kind, funny and very informative. We didn't stop laughing all day.Great value for a full day out.Thanks Efi and Dimitrios for yet another wonderful day with superb food, drink, but most of all lovely company / friends.Can't wait until next year!Best wishes to you for a good season"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HannahFine,June 2019,5,The dream day out!,"This trip was better than fantastic. We started at 8am with a very warm welcome from Efi & Dimitris with coffee and nibbles. We set off to start bringing in the fishing nets. It was so incredible and we caught a huge variety of fish. We were able to help the professionals and were educated well. We moved to an even more stunning location where we could snorkel in the turquoise water. The fish was prepared and cooked on board for our lunch. Efi is an inspirational woman. She grows and makes most of the produce we were given. Homemade lemonade & wine, gorgeous salads, and fresh fruits to snack on. The lunch was delicious and more types of fish to try than ever expected. Thank you for making our honeymoon so special.️"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathrynpC4267IX,June 2019,5,Fantastic day out,We had a wonderful day out with Dimitris and Efi. They were so kind and accommodating to us and our 6 month old baby. We were made to feel very welcome and nothing was too much trouble. The lunch of our freshly caught fish catch was absolutely delicious and the views of the coastline from the boat were beautiful. All in all it was a relaxing day out which we would highly recommend. 
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/153estherj,June 2019,5,The best day ever!!!,"Our fishing cruise trip with the lovely efi & dimitris was a day we will never forget. Such an amazing experience, retrieving so many fish from the nets, plenty of swimming in the sea, the freshest fish you could ever have cooked for you with so much more. I could not praise this up enough and we will definitely do this again and again. Thankyou"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KefaliniaSunseeker36,May 2019,5,Excellent a must do trip,"Went on this trip in May and we had a fantastic time , you are made to feel like family , the food is amazing , we are booking again for our trip in 2020 ...we loved it xx"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahwU4227ZB,June 2019,5,Every year gets better and better!,"This was our 7th trip in 3 years with Efi & Dimitris and as in previous years it was the best day of our holiday by an absolute mile! You never know what interesting people you are going to meet on the boat, taking a maximum of 12 people the group size is perfect for getting to know your fellow fishermen and women for the day. Giggles galore and the freshest, prettiest food in the whole of Kefalonia.The swim stops were well thought out, avoiding the busier tourist beaches and heading instead to some hidden little gems, accessible only by boat allowing us to swim in crystal clear water in peace and privacy. Whilst on the boat the crew are very knowledgable about the fish that come on board, ensuring safety at all times but keeping the atmosphere relaxed and fun. It is truly a learning experience of traditional Greek fishing, allowing you to see the wide variety of marine life on the island close up. On each trip we always seem to find something new, from lobsters, crabs, rays, barracuda, snapper, mullet, stargazers, hake, bream, parrot fish, eels, scorpion fish and our personal favourite this year the flying fish (which was released back to the Ionian sea) to name but a few. The boat is impeccably clean for a working boat with facilities available on board. We were served a feast of freshly caught, freshly cooked and locally sourced food by our hosts, washed down by homemade lemonade (a firm favourite every year), homemade wine, Greek beer or soft drinks. There is something for everyone on this trip. The fishing tourism business has become quite a competitive market in Kefalonia but Efi & Dimitris are the original and best. Their 100% positive genuine reviews speak for themselves with people returning year after year. Already looking forward to next year’s trip!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KeithM449,June 2019,5,Excellent Fishing Cruise,"Great fun with first couple hours netting a very good selection of fish, then a couple of swimming/snorkelling opportunities then finally a fantastic, huge fresh fish lunch - absolutely deliciously!!! "

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieP123456,June 2019,5,Great Day Out,This was a really great trip and a fantastic experience. We had lovely hosts who made us feel very welcome and put on a great lunch from the days catch. We were able to watch the nets being pulled in and the option for three swim stops. I would definitely recommend to anyone who likes to eat fish or would like to try more.
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O5451FAkenm,June 2019,5,Dont miss it,Went on tour what a great day out got to sample great fishing and fabulous food  wine and lemonade saw lots of places which you could only reach by boat totally great experience  with lovely  hosts a not to be missed tour if your ever in kefalonia

Three generations of our family on board and we had a great day. Food, boat and hosts all first class and next time we're in Katelios we'll be back. A must do trip!! Thank you Efi & Dimitrios for the perfect day."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lilyah1,June 2019,5,Amazing tour with Efthi and Dimitrios! ,"We loved this special boat trip in Katelios. It’s so different to typical cruises and we feel lucky to have had a taste of real Greek life in Kefalonia. We had three opportunities to swim in the clear turquoise sea and enjoyed lots of relaxation time. We released the fish from the nets and Efthi cooked us a beautiful fresh meal. We drank homemade wine, ate fresh salads and tucked into the tastiest fish fresh from the sea.It’s a day we will never forget! It’s great going with a small group of people as you have the chance to talk over lunch as well as hear Efthi’s stories. Thank you Efthi, Dimitrios and Mohammed! We loved it and will hopefully be back in the future. Lily and Jack "
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patrickfV2082GK,June 2019,5,The highlight of our trip to Kefalonia!! ,My wife and I enjoyed a fantastic trip yesterday with Dimitrios and Efi. My wife isn’t massively into fishing but loved it because whilst some of the trip is reeling in the nets (people can be as involved as they want to in this...or not) the rest of the trip was swimming in amazing areas only reached by boat and snorkelling around the area. We both had a fantastic day and our best meal of the trip was one Efi cooked on board from the catch. Highly recommended to anyone and the hosts couldn’t be friendlier. A++++++++
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tropicskincarehelen,June 2019,5,Amazing day with Efi and Dimitri!,"Just had the most fantastic day with Efi and Dimitrios! Both of you were so friendly and hospitable and have is a day to remember. We sadly missed this trip last time we visited Kefalonia and booked in advance to ensure we got to go for this visit. This trip is an absolute must for anyone that wants to experience something different where you can be hands on as you like or just sit back. We took our two children who loved to see all the difference types of fish and help pull the nets in. The crew had fantastic knowledge of all the fish. Efthi is an amazing cook and managed to knock up a banquet of most the fish from the catch today along with beautiful homegrown produce and own wine. I’ve never tried so many different types of fish in one meal. We also had opportunities to jump off at two lovely beaches accessible by boat only and try the local clay as a mask on our bodies whilst on one beach. Everything was planned to give a perfect day. My son who loves fishing wants to go again this week if possible  it’s a shame we aren’t stopping closer to Katelios. We all loved today so thanks so much for everything and we will definitely be back again and wouldn’t hesitate in recommending this trip to anyone.I have been visiting Kefalonia for 30 years with my family and and always look for new places to visit. This was one of the best and we will definitely book again. I’ve met many people from Kefalonia over the years and just love the friendliness of locals, Efi and Dimitri who clearly are passionate about fishing and are such lovely people who certainly make this trip special."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniela511960,June 2019,5,This is a must ,"Today will  be about Kefalonia, Efthimia and Dimitrios. Kefalonia is my favourite island from the 7 Greek island I’ve seen so far. And Efthimia and Dimitrios will be, from now on, one more reason for that. They are my favourite tour hosts, ever. The food Efthimia cooks ( fresh, catch of the day fish, sea food and vegetables) is delicious; Dimitrios is funny, communicative and helpful. Their small boat is spotless, and comfortable. For  those who, like me,  had no idea about net fishing, it is very instructive, too. Don’t miss this experience, if you are in Kefalonia. It’s a must.And now about Kefalonia : as in all the Ionian Sea islands, water is unbelievable clear, and in 50 shades of ...blue. It changes colors,depending on the moment of the day. At this time of the year the water is rather cold, but refreshing, all in all. People are friendly and helpful and speak English quite well. There are lots of guests houses, b&b, hotels. The entire island is full of small, cosy villages, each and every one of it with its special feature. As the island is practically a mountain in the middle of the sea you’ll definitely need a car, as everywhere you go, you’ll have to go up and down on windy roads. The views are amazing, breathtaking, wherever you look. And it’s not crowded if you chose to come beginning of June or late August, beginning of September.I don’t know exactly about July and August but most certainly it might be too hot. Depending on your interests, the hosts of your guests house will advise you. Argostoli the capital, is a nice,  clean and neat city, with something for everybody( fancy restaurants and hotels, dancing clubs, local designers shops, playgrounds for children ) but  if you prefer just to relax and enjoy a good bath in Cristal clear waters and white, yellow, black sand, look for lodging in the villages scattered all over the moutains. You won’t regret it. "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KIRBYTOURS,June 2019,5,Fantastic day - highly recommended ,Just returned from a fantastic day with Efi and Dimitrios. We had a fantastic welcome and I can't recommend highly enough.We wanted to do something a bit different to a standard island cruise and this was perfect. They have a well equipped traditional fishing boat with lots of seating. The first couple of hours were spent reeling their nets in that had been put out the night before and seeing what was caught. Some of this was also a fantastic lunch. Definitely the best meal of our holiday! Also included were drinks and we also had two or three nice long stops for a swim and relax on beaches only accessible by boat.A definite five stars and if we come back to kefalonia again we'll do it again! 
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreaBude,May 2019,5,A Must Do,"Amazing day fishing with Efi and Dimitrios, the perfect hosts. You start with bringing in the nets, you can help if you like. Then there’s the chance to swim from the boat, whilst lunch is prepared. Fab food fresh fish, home grown salad and Efi’s potatoes ️ plus homemade wine. A must do, great chance to sight see and relax in the best company."

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Propert,May 2019,5,Best day of holiday,Went on trip with Efi and Dimitrios on 31/08/18.It is a great way to see and swim in the secluded coves especially the one with the mud bath.You can watch the fish coming out of the nets as they are brought up from the sea bed and help empty them or just sit back and watch.Efi cooks the catch for the best meal you will ever taste.It’s an awesome day out and ideal way for children to learn about the sea.Would fully recommend to all.
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sefm21,August 2018,5,Unforgettable experience!!,We took part in this tour in August and had the most amazing time!! I have done a few boat trips in different parts of Greece and this one stands out as the most unique and unforgettable experience! Dimitrios and Efthimia were wonderful hosts and so helpful and friendly! Been able to experience fishing with nets was so fun and then we had those fish prepared for lunch. The meal that was prepared for lunch was absolutely delicious! Along with the fish there were a selection of other dished prepared with ingredients from Dimitrios and Efthimia's own garden.The swimming stops throughout the tour were stunning! We really enjoyed been able to swim in such secluded beaches with crystal blue water. Overall this tour was a highlight of our Greece trip and I would highly recommend it to anyone!

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X6932XOlauraf,September 2018,5,Best day of our holiday!,"A fabulous day on Efi and Dimitrios' working fishing boat.  You couldn't meet a more welcoming and friendly couple.  I emailed Efi from the UK and booked our places in advance.   We were greeted onto a spotlessly clean boat with a coffee and biscuits.  We then helped bring the fishing nets in and taking the day's catch out of the nets, Efi helped us to identify each species.  We had 3 swim spots during the day, one being to a small pebbled cove with crystal clear warm water, perfect for snorkelling and totally idyllic. Being summoned back to the boat, we were greeted with the catch of the day for lunch, having been grilled and accompanied with the most delicious greek and potato salad, and local wine/beer, all prepared by Efi.     The day went far too quickly and it is a trip we will definitely repeat next year when we return to Kefalonia.  I can't recommend this trip highly enough."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albion_12,August 2018,5,Fantastic family day out,"We were in Kefalonia for 2 weeks with our 4 teenage kids.  For our second week we rented a villa just outside Skala and were looking for some activities to keep everyone happy.  I stumbled upon Dimitrios and Efi's fishing trip on TripAdvisor, and wasn't really sure - it was quite expensive, would the kids enjoy it, all day, what if someone wanted to get off the boat, what if we were travel sick, would there be life jackets?!!  In the end we went for it and i'm so glad we did!! To see the kids actually enjoying finding the different fish in the nets and un-ravelling them, to experience the wonderful Greek hospitality of our hosts - it is too much to write!  The life jackets were excellent quality, although not really needed. Nobody was travel sick and the water was very calm.  One of the stops involved visiting a natural mud pool which everyone enjoyed, especially the girls - a freebie beauty treatment thrown in!  And the day we visited we had the great good fortune to land on a beach in time to watch the ocean turtle eggs hatching - a fantastic experience.   And then there was the food!!!  A thoroughly enjoyable meal, with the pleasurable company of our hosts and one other family aboard - the freshest fish I've ever eaten, accompanied by wonderful local Greek produce from Efi's own garden, and homemade wine.   I thought the day might drag, but in the end everyone was surprised and disappointed when we realised we were heading back for land.   A really great experience, I would recommend to anyone - really was money well spent.  Dimitri and Efi - sas efharistoume!!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/591selinak,September 2018,5,Best day of our 6 week holiday!,"This was the highlight of our trip. Dimitrios and Efthimia were absolutely wonderful hosts, soo down to earth and entertaining and go out of their way to make sure everyone is comfortable and has a great time. Not to mention the food was better than in any restaurant by mile!!!! Such a great cook!We went to 3 secluded beach spots to swim and in between helped remove fish from a gill net. The fish was prepared and cooked while we were all swimming and everything was timed to perfection. I will definitely do this again when back in Kefalonia!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueHenderson63,August 2018,5,A great day out,"A wonderful day out with Efi & Dimitrios, a working fishing boat where you help (if you want to) to bring in the fishing nets with Dimitrios. But so much more, they then take you off to a quiet bay where you can have a swim or walk along a beach while Efi cooks you a delicious lunch, usually all the different fish they have just caught. Back onto the boat for lunch and then another quiet bay for more swimming. Only small boat maximum people 8-10, it was full with all my family so felt even more special, like a totally private hire. Efi & Dimitirios are such lovely people, very friendly and although we were strangers when we got on board, I definitely now would call them friends. Can't wait til next year and our next trip."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mskittykat74,July 2018,5,An unforgettable experience,"We spent the day with Efi and Dimitrios celebrating our daughters 16th birthday and it was an amazing day that we will never forget. Efi and Dimitrios are wonderful, friendly people who make everyone feel really welcome. We started the trip with coffee and bread and Efi's homemade apricot marmalade, which was delicious. We also saw Adonis the turtle in Katelios harbour, my children were absolutely thrilled. Then we went to the fishing grounds, it was so interesting learning about all the different fish. Efi cooked an amazing lunch with our catch which all of us thoroughly enjoyed. We also had several swimming stops at fabulous beaches. If you come to Kefalonia and want to do something amazing and unforgetable go and spend the day with Efi and Dimitrios, you won't be disappointed."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doromaysam,August 2018,5,So much more than fishing - fantastic day put,What a fantastic day we had with Efi and Dimitrios.  From the moment you step on their boat you know from their warm welcome that you are in for a good day.  The harbour turtle made an appearance before we set off as an added bonus.  Once out the harbour we headed towards Poros whilst drinking coffee and homemade biscuits.  Once stopped the nets are pulled in and you either watch or join in with the removal of the various small fish from the nets - the kids of all ages loved this!  During all this Dimitrios and Efi are watching and guiding - ensuring what should go back to the sea dies - an Octopus was sent back once we’d all watched it move across the deck. Once the nets are in we head back towards Argostoli again you can just sit and watch the view or help with removing the bigger fish in the nets.  Dimitrios knows just where to stop and we got to see a seal before various beach stops where kids of all ages can snorkel or jump off the boat and enjoy the crystal water.  Even a spa treatment is thrown in with a stop at a bay where there is mineral rich clay that had us all covering ourselves and baking before a swim back to the boat to remove the clay and have a delightful lunch - Efi cooks up a storm of freshly caught fish and beautiful salads.  A few more stops after lunch on the way back to Katelios harbour.  Such an amazing day from start to finish and one we will definitely do again. In short amazing 
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurenceD285,August 2018,5,Another great day!,"Our second trip with Efi and Dimitrios and this time was every bit as good as the first; starting with coffee and savouries then help pull in the nets and remove the fish. Off for a swim at one of the beautiful local beaches whilst Efi and Dimitrios clean the fish and prepare lunch.Lunch is a selection of the catch, grilled and served with local grown salad and potatoes. After lunch a change of bay and more swimming, a light dessert of fruit then on to another bay for another swim before heading for home.Efi and Dimitrios are the perfect hosts making you feel welcome and ensuring that you want for nothing.Can't recommend highly enough, can't wait to see you next year!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Departure565572,August 2018,5,Great experience ,"We had a fabulous day fishing, swimming and eating what we caught. The fresh fish tasted amazing. I highly recommend this trip. "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewmanJJL,August 2018,5,Second visit,"Fantastic day spent with Efi Bacha Takidou and Dimitrios on 13th August. When we booked our return to Kefalonia this year we knew this day trip was a must again.  Loved the whole day, from the swimming in the beautiful clear Ionian, the clay spa, seeing the many varieties of fish and then lunch. Efi you are an amazing cook and the homemade wine was excellent. Have never had the opportunity to try Barracuda before. Such a wonderful day with such lovely people."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leedsunited70,August 2018,5,Unforgettable day ,"Met  warmly by the lovely couple who run this boat we headed straight out to sea and collected two 1km nets.  All packed with a wide range of fish.  We all helped unpick the fish which was great fun and really informative.  We then cruised for some swimming on a secluded beach and then to another - whilst the food was prepared - a bonus was that the next beach had some clay reserves which we liberally applied to ourselves and then lay in the sun baking like ceramic pots.  A quick wash then food time.  It was perfect in every way - fresh - really really really fresh! organic, locally produced salad and wine (from their own land) and cooked with love, care and attention!  A meal we’ll never forget.  The boat isn’t crowded at all and as a result we all got to know each other and had some good chats and laughs as we cruised back to the harbour - where we met and fed a friendly turtle called Tony!  Do this trip it’s fantastic."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/biekeleenknegt,August 2018,5,Amazing learnfull experience !!!,We went with our family and had a great time !!!We got to see how to fish and were able to try it ourselves which was a once of a life experience also we stopped at a few beaches where we could swim and later that day we ate the fish we caught ! I really recommend this to families and friend and I can promise you that you'll have a great time.Dimitrios and Efthimia are a lovely couple to hang around with and they'll give you a excellent time :)
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/236debim,August 2018,5,Fantastic cruise,"Just got back from our fishing cruise. What an amazing day, Demitri & Effi were fantastic hosts who couldn't do enough for you. The freshly caught fish were cooked to perfection, accompanied by a delicious potato salad and homemade wine. We cruised along the beautiful coastline with a couple of swim breaks in coves only reachable by boat.It's a trip we will do again and highly recommend. "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisontB9059YT,August 2018,5,Superb day out!,"We booked the trip via email when we arrived on the island, we received a prompt response and were able to book a day convenient for us.  We have 2 teenagers and they thoroughly enjoyed the day, although it would also appeal to younger children aswell.  When the nets start to come up with the abundance of fish in them it is fascinating for both adults and children alike! Our 18 year old son enjoyed the challenge of taking the fish out of the nets!   Lobster, baraccuda, cray fish, scorpion fish, pig fish, stingray to name just a few!!  We were then treated to visiting a few coves where we were able to swim from the boat whilst Efi and Dimitrios prepared the fish.  The meal that was prepared was amazing! - all the fish that had been caught had been cooked and served with fabulous salad, bread and washed down with wine and beer!  A perfect day out which was the highlight of our 2 weeks on Kefalonia - thankyou!!  If we ever re-visit the island, we would not hesitate to do this trip again."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adriantracy,July 2018,5,A truly amazing day,"A trip for everybody, from lazing, relaxing, soaking up the sunshine type of day, to becoming involved in the daily catch if you wish.We started the day by having a light breakfast of coffee and home made marmalade/biscuits, before taking a leisurely trip out to the nets, here you can just relax and take in the amazing sea views or watch the daily catch come on board.  We then took off to view the beautiful Kefalonia scenery before stopping off at secluded beaches that can only be reached by boat.  Whilst you cool off in the most beautiful blue sea Efi and Dimitrios prepare a banquet fit for royalty, with produce fresh from the sea, collected from Katelios or from their personal garden or neighbouring islands.  Watch out for the wine its a bit delicious, home made by the beautiful couple.There is then time for a swim after lunch or a little line fishing before setting off back to Katelios. The boat is spotlessly clean, it also has excellent toilet facilities.  For those of you considering a boat trip, this really is one for all the family.  There is never more than 10 people on board and they also do private trips.This is the second time we have been on this trip and are already looking forward to our next.  A big thank you to Efi and Dimitrios the nicest and best hosts you are likely to meet.Adrian and Tracy"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevine181,July 2018,5,Unique day.,"This is a special trip. If you have the opportunity, take it. And you may have the best lunch you will ever have on your holiday."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422gavd,August 2018,5,Top notch day out,"Forget the big organised tours with a large boat crammed with tourists - if you want a bit of an insight into small scale local life combined with a relaxing day visiting beaches - loo no further than this trip.We joined a small group of folk for the day, which began with coffee & a light breakfast.  We were soon off & pulling in the nets - helping (if you wanted to) to untangle the assorted fish.  We were surprised to be joined by a large eel almost immediately - but it was soon cast back overboard by Dimitri to hunt again.  We caught mainly parrot fish in the 'big fish' net, with a wider selection, including several cuttlefish in the smaller fish net.  We also threw back some interesting stuff, like rays and scorpion fish, before setting off for our first beach.  On the way we stuck the boat's nose in a couple of caves - catching a nice view of a seal.Once there, we enjoyed a relaxing swim, while Efi prepared dinner.The meal was lovely.  The fish we'd caught was supplemented by salads, potatoes and cold drinks.The second beach we visited was a bit better for snorkelling and it also had a natural clay pit that we all used to cover ourselves in.  Not sure what cleansing qualities it had - but it was good fun looking like a gargoyle for a while!There was (I think) a third beach that we should've visited, but we stayed longer here as one of the youngsters in our party had been a little sea sick on the initial journey. Besides the freshly caught fish, much of what we ate and drank had been grown and produced by our hosts, including the breakfast jam, salads and rose wine.In summary, a memorable and worthwhile trip expertly hosted by local folk.  Champion!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthawL4027FG,July 2018,5,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,"Thank you Efi & Dimitri for a fantastic & fun fishing trip. We enjoyed every part of it & it was a highlight of our holiday. You are great hosts & if returning to Kefelonia we hope to see you again! Sam, Dave & Oliver."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelguyd,August 2018,5,Best day out ever!,"This was a the second time we’ve been on this trip in so many years.  Efi and Demitri are wonderful hosts, nothing is too much trouble for them.  They do all the hard work and you get all the glory and, if fishing’s not your thing you can just watch.  They know the best secluded bays to take you to for a swim, at one of the beaches Demitri has even cleared a path of stones from the sea to the shore so its easier to get walk on to the beaches and try out the natural clay pools for a great mud pack!Whilst we’re chilling in the sea and on the sand Efi creates the best lunch ever. All the salad and veg are home grown from their garden as is the wine, you eat what you catch, so the fish really can’t be any fresher.  It really is a feast!My son and I love our days out with them so much, we’re going out again next week before we go home. "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindseym58,August 2018,5,Most amazing day!,"We have just had one of the most memorable days of our lives.All thanks to Dimitrios and Efthimia.What a day! And where to start?!?First of all we must say if you are visiting the island this is a MUST do trip. Even if you do one this has to be it.We saw turtles, seals and so many types of fish. Helped trawl the fish from the sea and helped get them out of the net. We learned so much about each fish thst was caught, Dimitrios and Efthimia are so knowledgeable and truly know what they are talking about. We sailed to two remote beaches. Both breathtaking. One had a pit of natural clay. We covered ourselves in it. It felt amazing to use earths natural resources in that way. Our skin looked and felt like we'd been at a spa for the day.Even our teenage son joined in. We swam in the perfect turquoise waters and so much fun diving and jumping off the boat.While we were left to enjoy our surroundings Dimitrios and Efthimia were preparing and cooking up a storm on board. All the fish caught from the morning we ate. It was the best meal we'd eaten since being here. Everything was so fresh and tasty. We were astounded with all that was provided. Homemade lemonade, wine, fresh watermelon,  salads, fish, bread. We were all stuffed! The boat was constantly being hosed down and kept clean. We could go on and on but you just have to experience it yourself. It's for every age from young to old (or wise) Really was a day to remember.Thank you so much Dimitrios and Efthimia!!We will be coming back again!! Lindsey, Lee and Lucas"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wordl_Traveller,August 2018,5,This is a “Must Do” if you are in Kefalonia,"Run by the two nicest people in Greece - Dimitris and Efi. We had the best day!  We started at 8am from Kefalonia Harbour and set out to pull in the fishing nets that had been set the night before. Kids were Uber excited as we pulled in Parrot fish, bass, bream, mullet, Scorpion fish, squid and cuttlefish plus more - and everyone helped. Then went to a deserted beach for swimming and discovered a hidden gem... natural mineral-rich clay which we plastered all over our bodies before swimming back to the boat for a FANTASTIC meal of the fish we’d caught plus fresh vegetables from Efi’s and Dimitrios’ garden all washed down by their excellent home made wine!My 14year old daughter described it as “the best day of my life” Enough said!I really recommend it!John"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahEver86,June 2018,5,A FANTASTIC TRIP!,"This trip was absolutely incredible. The hosts were so friendly and kind, we had such a fun day and enjoyed every moment. Efi’s cooking is so so tasty, and her homemade wine is even better! We caught and ate an wonderful amount of fish, the swimming in the sea was just paradise and the whole day was honestly one of best I’ve ever had on a holiday. Well worth every penny and can’t recommend the trip enough! "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tillymint1975,August 2018,5,An unmissable experience.,"We had the extreme pleasure of doing this trip last July and our family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children of 8 and 12) loved the trip so much we knew we just had to do it agin this year. Efi and Demetri are the perfect hosts for your day and make you feel extremely welcome from the very minute you step on board. It may seem like an early start however you will not regret it. Breakfast is served on board with coffee and pastries but the best is the bread served with slathering of Efi’s homemade marmalade.There are two stops to help them haul in their catch from the nets that they have put out even earlier in the morning! The nets are brought in quite slowly so you can see each fish coming in. Efi patiently describes each fish and lets the children (and grown ups) take the fish out of the nets so they can see and feel the experience in equal measure. This year we caught parrot fish, red snapper, bream, cuttlefish, starfish, perch, and a flying fish. Once the fishing is done the rest of the day is dedicated to stopping at a number of remote little coves that you can really only access by boat. These little treasure are what dreams are made of. White shores and crystal clear blue waters. You can dive off the boat and swim in or just relax on the boat. The highlight of the kids day is when Demetri stops at a beach where there is an abundance of natural clay just in the rocks on the shore. If you fancy a spa treatment while out a sea just rub this all over you and let it dry in to make your skin feel lovely!While you are swimming, Efi and Demetri prepare lunch on board which, if you are a fish fan, is just heavenly. Some of the fish you have just help to catch being cooked in front of your eyes - it doesn’t get much fresher than that. All this topped off with breads, salads full of vegetables fresh from their garden and not least their own homegrown wine.On the way back Demetri lets the kids take to the helm and do a bit of sailing which they think is amazing. You could not ask to meet a more lovely couple to spend the day with. They share all their expertise with you and make your trip feel very personal. The boat is not crowded like on other trips we have been on. After the trip was over Demetri very kindly helped our son set up his fishing rod as we had brought one with us but no idea how to use! He didn’t need to do this but it was no trouble. I would highly recommend this trip as an experience not to be missed."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrpepper2016,July 2018,5,The best time ever!,"From the start Efi and Dimitri made us feel like we had always been onboard. We swam in crystal clear waters, helped to bring in the fish ( Snapper, Bream, Mullett, Scorpion and Parrot Fish ) which we later ate, with the most delicious salad and wine. Barracuda was my favourite, which I may have kissed! (optional) from the start to the finish we had lots of fun and learnt alot. Thanks to all our crew members and Efi and Dimitri Will see you again."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyinamsterdam,July 2018,5,The BEST day out!!!,"Our family of 6 (spanning the generations - from 84 year old Grandpa right down to our 7 year old) headed out with Dimitri and Efi today and I can't say enough good things about the entire experience. We had a lovely friendly welcome and were straight away offered a delicious breakfast spread (Efi's bread with homemade jam; delicious!). We were joined by another family of four (who had returned for a second year running, which says a lot about how great it is), making up the 10 maximum that the boat is allowed. It is the perfect number - convivial but never feeling crowded. We headed out to two nets first, to winch them in and help separate the catch from the nets. The kids and adults loved it and Efi and Dimitri are very knowledgable, teaching you about each fish that you come across. They answered all of our questions in lots of detail - it was a fascinating insight in to the working life of fishermen (and women!). They are absolute natural with the kids, making sure they are safe but also making sure they have tonnes of fun too. After the nets were in we headed off to stop at a series of remote beaches, where we jumped off the boat and swam ashore, while Efi prepared the lunch. And the lunch was out of this world - huge amounts of food to go round and such a privilege to have such a wide range of the freshest fish that we'd just helped to haul in then prepared by experts for us. Efi's garden provides the rest, from the homemade wine right down to the pickled samphire on the salad. Huge wedges of watermelon rounded the day off as we buzzed back to the harbour. All in all it was the best day of our holiday, hands down!"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dodger7569,July 2018,5,An absolute must!!!!!,"Thank you all for a fabulous day, Our Family will be in touch to book 2019!!!!For anyone considering a boat trip, I cannot  praise this trip high enough....Food fantastic....Hosts terrific...Even learned something!!See you next year!!!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreaBude,July 2018,5,A must do !!,"Possibly the best trip we've ever done. Day starts with lovely breakfast,Efi and Dimitris then set sail. Bringing the nets in and helping is just great, followed by a swim from the boat. They prepare the most amazing lunch (Efi the potatoes were amazing️) and never eaten such fresh fish. If ever you visit Katelios this really is a must, can't recommend it highly enough. "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dawniebrander,July 2018,5,Perfect day!,"We booked this trip via the gift shop on the walk down to the beach from our hotel. We wanted something different from the usual boat trips and we wasn't disappointed. We boarded the boat at 8am at Katelios harbour and were welcomed by Dimitrios and Efi. They are a lovely couple and we felt like family rather than tourists. There is a maximum of ten people per trip and on our day there was eight of us and we all got along really well. Once we left the harbour, we were presented with bread and gorgeous homemade marmalade, biscuits and tea and coffee. You then watch Dimitrios start pulling in the nets and you then see what fish has been caught overnight. Efi then untangles them from the nets, you can help if you wish or just watch and learn whilst taking in the beautiful scenery. Once all the nets are in you can swim off the boat to a small beach whilst the fish is prepared for lunch. Efi then amazingly cooks the fish to perfection on limited facilities. Amongst our catch we had parrot fish, red snapper, cuttlefish and two small lobster! Back on the boat for lunch which was served with Greek salad, potatoes and bread together with homemade wine. Totally delicious! After lunch you are taken to another beach for a swim if you wish or you can stay on the boat and chat with Efi and Dimitrios and other guests. You return to Katelios harbour around 3pm. This is a fantastic trip made special by Efi and Dimitrios and a must for anyone visiting kefalonia. Highly recommended. Thank you both. Mark and Dawn."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickj989,July 2018,5,A lovely day on the water,"My wife and I had a great day with Efth and Dimitrios. It was idyllic on their very chilled boat and lovely and cool (er) on the sea.We caught dozens of species of fish which Efth talked to us about with her excellent English. She then cooked up a feast on the boat, one of the best meals we have ever had with their own fish and...vegetables, olive oil, wine etc, amazing!They have two sets of snorkel and masks we used. All you need to take is a swimming costume and a towel, there is a loo on board and a cabin below to change in.One of the highlights of our holiday!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulwA4462PQ,July 2018,5,Super trip - a must do.,"The early start ( actually not that early 8am) was more than compensated for by the experience of the day. Loads of fish caught of all varieties. We loved getting stuck in releasing the fish from the nets - sometimes finding it a challenge to untangle them - in contrast with Efthimia, who could always quickly work it out. They tasted fantastic barbecued or fried - Bream, Parrot fish and Red Mullet mainly, served with salads, potato salad and finished off with fruit. Great atmosphere.We got to experience the Kefalonia shoreline and the crystal clear waters and to swim in lovely warm water at three locations. So much more rewarding than a simple “cruise”. The other party on the trip had been before, a ringing endorsement that we will repeat the next time we are in Kefalonia."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cocop286,July 2018,5,Formidable ,"a unique experience in a magical setting, a day that goes far too much. the welcome and kindness of efi and dimitrios and pleasant. They receive us as at home with a lot of nice attention and simplicity. fishing and really very good and to share the meal together it's just great. This is 2 times that I do this activity..I really advise everyone to do and especially to redo..thank you efi and dimitrios ."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3413ACiand,June 2018,5,A Special Day ,"Well the real highlight of a great 2 weeks in Kefalonia. Such a lovely atmosphere as soon as you step on the boat. Efi & Dimitrios are the perfect hosts with all the information and humour you could wish for.  The whole experience was outstanding from pulling the nets, to swimming at the beautiful little beaches. The fresh fish was amazing, as was the salads. It's hard to believe food of this standard can be produced on a little stove on a rocking boat. If you want to do something a little different on Kefalonia then I suggest this as there are so many special memories to be had"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Madcow4762,July 2018,5,5*Only way to describe this trip,"Stunning day out with the lovely Efi and Dimitri. Meet the boat at beautiful Kateleios harbour at 8am. Welcome aboard by charming hosts Efi and Dimitri. Motor out to bring in the nets and help as much or as little as you wish to untangle the catch of the day. Swim and Zumba the at your leisure whilst Efi and Dimitri prepare sumptuous lunch on board. Beer and wine and soft drinks are all included also try the Grappa! Another swim or a snooze before heading home, back to the harbour by 3pm. Tips for the trip: wear non slip boat shoes whilst on board. Take sunscreen although there is shade on the boat. If you are prone to seasickness take a Stugeron tablet an hour or so before the trip. The boat can be a bit rocky whilst the nets are being hauled in. Can not recommend this trip highly enough. Without a doubt it was the best day of our holiday. Efi and Dimitri make you feel more like family than tourists!!! A must do whilst in kefalonia !!!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussellS1872,July 2018,5,Wonderful fishing trip with Efi and Dimitrious,"Absolutely brilliant day out. Dimitrios and Efi are the most caring and friendly hosts. They take you out to gather the catch from the nets and you get to help extract the fish from the nets if you want to. The fish, including squid and scorpion fish, are then cooked up for one of the best meals you will have in Kefalonia. You get a couple of opportunities to swim in the crystal blue waters and they provide a selection of beer, home made wine and soft drinks. I highly recommend this day out."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ethanh994,June 2018,5,Family trip,"We had a fantastic day but what made it extra special was the care and attention Efi and Dimitri took with ourselves and our 5 year old child . A big memory for him best wishes Hamill family , ireland"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/popsypony,July 2018,5,Brilliant day made by Efi and Dimitrios,"Had a lovely day yesterday with Efi and Dimitrios we where due to do the trip early in the week but due to the bad weather Efi rearranged it for us, from start to finish this trip was fun and full of information about Kefalonia and the fish we caught and Efi cooked. There was 8 of us on the trip which was really nice as so many boat trips are crammed! But on this trip we all got time to get to know one another. We managed to catch lots of fish and cuttlefish Efi and Dimitrios explained what we where catching which was really interesting, we stopped in two beautiful places for a lovely swim and the lunch they provided was amazing. But most of all the day was made by Efi and Dimitrios hospitality they are really good hosts and made sure we where all catered for and that we enjoyed our trip. Highly recommend and a must do if coming to Kefalonia."

Fresh fish all cooked whilst you can go for a swim in the crystal waters, then sit back on the boat to eat together with home made wine! Fantastic day out enjoyed by all of us, such great memories to take home for us. Thank you "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulW5022,June 2018,5,Brilliant Day Out,Did the same trip last year and was just as brilliant this year. Fantastic hosts whose home made wine is a treat. Cant get fish fresher than that just pulled out the nets and cooked whilst you swim/snorkel off a secluded beach. Not to be missed
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruth642015,June 2018,5,Such a great day,"We had such a special day with Efi and Dimitios, we watched the nets being brought in, what we caught is what we ate, cooked by Efi while we swam to a sucluded beach, Efi used home grown ingredients, and we drank home made wine. We had a amazing day which some very special people"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairelE2854YL,June 2018,5,Memories we will never forget!,"Me and my boyfriend booked onto this trip and we weren’t disappointed. We were immediately welcomed on board by Efi & Dimitrios and given some bread with Efi’s delicious home made marmalade and coffee before setting sail.When the fishing nets were pulled in you could get as involved as you wanted to. My boyfriend was happy helping and untangling the fish from the nets however I was just happy watching, either way we both felt involved in the action!The variety of fish we caught was really interesting and both Efi and Dimitrios are clearly very knowledgable about the local marine life, teaching us all about it. They caught Lobster, Red Snapper, Baracuda, Parrot Fish, Stingwray, Flying Fish and many more.We were then taken to a beautiful spot with turquoise warm water and a secluded white stone beach. Whilst Efi & Dimitrios prepared us our fish lunch we snorkeled, and chilled in the sun. It was extremely peaceful and tranquil.The seafood lunch which was prepared was the some of the most delicious food we ate in our whole 10 day holiday. I was expeciting some of the mornings catches to be held back and sold once we docked back in Katelios but absolutely not! There was enough Lobster for 2/3 per person! Everything was home made from scratch by Efi who is an absolute talent cooking us such a feast on one stove. The lunch was washed down with as much of Efi & Dimitrios’s home made wine as you wanted and it was absolutely delicious! Efi & Dimitrios are such a welcoming and friendly couple who clearly have a passion for what they do. They were so accomadating and made us feel very at home aboard their boat.There is no doubt in my mind that we will be visiting Kefalonia for many more years and we will certainly be going on this trip again and again!Thankyou for such a fabulous trip!"

It was a really great day! I would definitely recommend it."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahwU4227ZB,June 2018,5,Best day of our holiday ,"This is the second year running we have been on a fishing cruise with Efi and Dimitris and it was just as good as we remembered! You feel part of a team from start to finish. Efi is the hostess with the mostess! :)From getting the fish out of the nets, to the beautiful swim stops, the homemade lemonade and wine, the delicious fresh fish lovingly cooked onboard the potato salad, the information about the island and it’s marine life, everything about the whole day was perfect."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacation551501,June 2018,5,Great day!,"We had an absolutely Awesome day out with Dimitrios and Efthimia.Within minutes of arriving on the boat we’d been made to feel extremely welcome and soon after watched the first net be hauled from the water, everyone joined in removing the fish and learning what they were.The day continued to get better and better we swam, made new friends and then were given the most delicious feast of fresh fish, salad and home made wine. Need I say more!!If you have the chance to go on this trip don’t miss it. It was an unforgettable day!We hope to return.Thanks Dimitrios and Efthimia.Amy and Nim Lockwood"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vasilisl2017,June 2018,5,Join and Enjoy an Unforgettable Fishing Cruise ​with your Family or Friends!,"We reach the fishplace where we will have the chance to experience fishing with nets not only for Cods, Red-mullets, Scorpion fish, Dentex, Seabreams but also for Lobsters, Norway Lobsters and Crabs. If you like you can help us empty the nets. Only when we pull in the nets do we realise how excited a fisherman gets at the sight of a good catch. You can also experience the magic of fishing with a fishing lineor a fishing rod.After fishing we steer to a beautiful isolated beach close to the fishing place, which has access only by boat. Meanwhile we empty the nets and we store the fish in ice. We anchor by the beach and there you will enjoy a wonderful swim or snorkelling in the turquoise crystal clear waters while Efthimia will be preparing a delicious meal.Under the shade of the boat, feeling the sea breeze we enjoy a good lunch made of the fish we caught, fresh organic vegetables from our garden, olive-oil from our olive grove and homemade wine of fine quality made from our organic grape vine."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MECR8,June 2018,5,This is a must do!,"Absolutely fantastic day! From beginning to end we had a great time. We loved helping get the fish out of the nets, Dimitrios let us be as hands-on as we wanted to. The food cooked and prepared by the couple was delicious and Efi's calamari is THE best around! We even had cherries from their garden after lunch. You don't have to like fishing to do this trip, just enjoy the sea air, clear water and most fresh fish on the Island! Great couple and a brilliant trip! Emma and Matt x"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/occred,May 2018,5,Amazing day! Best part of our trip!,Efi and Dimitrios are the best hosts you will ever meet. They treat you like family and do everything thing they can to make your fishing experience great. Efi is a great cook.She created a feast which we could not even finish. They obviously love what they do and are happy to share their love of fishing with you. We even caught eel and octopus!This will be the most remembered day of our trip! It is the first thing we mention when asked about our trip. After seeing many ruins in Greece this was a wonderful opportunity to spend time with the people of Greece. DO THIS! You will not regret it.
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucyI88,May 2018,5,Happy Day on the Boat,"An amazing day out for our group of 8 people!

2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelsparkle,August 2017,5,A fantastic fishing adventure!!! ,"Fantastic trip with such friendly people! We took our three children; age 9, 2 and 1, we all had a brilliant time! Helping with the nets, holding the fish (our two year old daughter is blind, Efi helped her feel the different fish), Greek dancing on the boat (which our little ones loved) , letting our two year old help with prepping the dinner (which was so yummy), jumping off the boat to swim and having a go at fishing! Thank you to Efi, Dimitrios and Muhammed for such a wonderful day and helping us create such beautiful memories! We hope to be back one day soon!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariannefps,September 2017,5,Fantastic educational day out and so much fun! ,"I went on the fishing trip with Captain Dimitrius and Effi and it was an incredible day out. They are fun, friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had the best time. You get to observe and join in on the pulling in of the fishing nets seeing how it works behind the scenes while learning so much. You then get the freshly caught fish cooked and salads from Efi's garden and it was the best meal I have had in 2 weeks in Kefalonia. My father wanted to do some fishing with a rod and while this is not normally part of the trip they accommodated this and he caught two fish. You also sail to see the beautiful coast lines and hidden beaches. I cannot recommend this trip highly enough for a great day out. Thank you so much for a great day! "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veeSouthport,September 2017,5,Absolutely Fabulous Days Fishing & Boat Trip - perfect day out at sea!,"Just returned from my first fishing boat  trip - what a fabulous experience!A great day out - well entertained; fed & watered together with great company. The day starts with a welcomed hot drink & introduction to other guests - between four and ten can be accommodated - 6 aboard today!First stop is to pull in the nets and discover what delights the ocean has provided, you can either join in or merely observe the process. Identifying the catch and learning the rope techniques all part of the fun.From here it's the first stop - a quiet bay to swim, snorkel or chat.Lunch is then prepared from the trawl. Efi prepares restaurant quality fare -simple fresh and plentiful.All of us absolutely delighted with lunch - compliments all round. Produce is from their own garden - vegetables & fruits. A sail around the coast to Poros and a leisurely return to shore.We considered many day trips before tie one and delighted with the choice.Wonderful - many thanks."

A brilliant day out with Dimitrios and Efi , they are such a lovely couple and will go out of their way to ensure you enjoy your day, They set their nets at 3am in the morning and you then join them at 8am when they collect their nets and you get to see what was caught. You also get the chance to swim in amazing clear waters whilst Efi prepares a wonderful lunch with the fish that was caught along with salad and bread etc. Muhammed was a great laugh and you can help him to empty the nets. It is a day that no one should miss and we thoroughly recommend it. We are returning to Kefalonia next September and will be sure to catch up with Dimitrios and Efi again."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolynwY7430UT,August 2017,5,Wickham's Trip with Efi and Dimitrios,Wonderful day out with fabulous hosts! Loved helping bringing the catch in before some lovely swim stops and the most amazing lunch! Super relaxing and so much nicer than the bigger boat trips which are so much busier. Thank you Efi and Dimitrios xx
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drbarbaraconway,August 2017,5,"What an amazing experience. We were welcomed by Effi, DImitri and Mohammad onto the fishing boat and the day began","We helped get in the 2 km nets and sort out the fish, including a lobster. We got to have 3 beautiful swims on deserted beaches including a brilliant beach with clay that made our skin feel re vitalised. Effi cooked a fantastic meal with the fish caught and my husband experienced lobster for the first time. We were made to feel welcome and all the people with us on the experience bonded and had a rare shared moment in paradise with turquoise seas and fun moments. A perfect day and perfect hosts, thank you DImitri, Efficient and Mohammad."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GIZMO654,August 2017,5,Brilliant! ,"Effi, Dimitrious and Mohammed really make this trip - thank you to you all for a fabulous day out! The day starts with donuts and coffee for breakfast followed by bringing in nets that contain your lunch. My 12 year old enjoyed untangling the fish from the nets and Efi was full of local knowledge. A couple of sublime beaches later complete with a full body clay treatment we were ready for lunch. And what a lunch! Fresh fish, an always solid Greek salad and then; Effie's Potato Salad - to die for! Great company from the Netherlands and Italy - a really special day. Again thanks to Efi, Dimitrious and Mohammed, so welcoming and instructive. Would definitely do again. "
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adriantracy,July 2017,5,An amazing day,"Even if you are not keen on fishing, this trip is totally amazing.  Seeing the team at work, followed by swim stops in the beautiful, clear, blue water. Lunch consisted of the freshly caught fish ""amazing opportunity for novist fish eaters to try something new"" all the vegetables are home grown, which great pride is taken when offering traditional Greek recipes.  The hosts are so welcoming and friendly you can not help but feel apart of their widen family.  Thank you for a fantastic experience and a trip we shall repeat next year. Trip ideal for families with children as well as couples and groups."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6245gillian,August 2017,5,The best trip ever,"This is the most perfect way to spend a day. Starting with breakfast on board the boat this day includes bringing the fishing nets in and helping to unload the fish if you like or just take photos if you prefer. Then some swim stops in crystal clear water to deserted beaches and to cover ourselves with the natural clay. You are made to feel so welcome and the lovely Effi cooks the fish and serves it with a delicious salad, potatoes, bread and wine. There are plenty of drinks in a cool box throughout the day. This is a day everyone, young or old would enjoy it was truly perfect. Many happy memories made here. "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Propert,July 2017,5,Amazing,"My daughter told me to book the trip as it looked really interesting to me spending a day on a working fishing boat & so glad we did it.We had the most amazing day with our hosts and our fellow passengers newlyweds Piotr and Malwina from Poland and Danielle from Blackpool who were great company.Emptying the nets, snorkelling in secluded bays, eating fresh snapper and lobster and drinking a few cheeky glasses of wine and plenty of laughs.An awesome day we will never forget.Thank you for your hospitality."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joehL6827DZ,July 2017,5,"Must do ,I repeat must do !!!",Best trip ever we set off at 8.00 am and where we were made very welcome on the boat with coffee and breakfast we then pulled the nets of fish and lobsters with descriptions of what was what especially for the kids on the boat.We moored up off of a beach accessable only by boat for a swim whilst lunch was prepared and I won't spoil your surprise but lunch is brilliantAll in all its a fantastic day out and Efi and Demetri WILl make your trip as great as ours was 10/10
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heatherlS2616TY,July 2017,5,Perfect Day out,So glad we did this - it was a bunch of six of us and we loved every minute. Effi and Dimitri were so kind and welcoming and we felt right at home. It was a great mixture of seeing the fish in the morning and then travelling around some beautiful islands and beaches that we would have never found on our own. The lunch Effi cooked for us on the boat was out of this world and their homemade wine was delicious as well! Couldnt recommend this more strongly!
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3776AOsophieb,July 2017,5,"Incredible day fishing, snorkelling, eating delicious food and drinking wine","This was such a great experience. We set off at around 9am. We spent the morning net fishing, and then stopped at an island for a swim. We stopped at another two beaches in the afternoon, before eating a delicious lunch of fresh fish, salad and wine brewed by Efi and Dimitrios. It was a great opportunity to see the island, with the added benefit of the local knowledge of Efi, Dimitrios and Mohammed. We were a group of 6 friends, aged 28-30, but the experience would suit all types of groups of all ages. Efi, Dimitrious and Mohammed are fantastic. Definitely recommend this. "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drumc0vitt,July 2017,5,Fabulous fishing adventure ,"My family and I (2 adults and 2 children aged 10 and 12 years) had a brilliant day fishing with Efi, Dimitrios and Mohammed. The morning started with delicious treats, coffee and juice before setting off to haul the fishing nets in which had been laid much earlier in the morning. It was really interesting and informative, particularly for the children, to see where and how we get our fish.Among the catch was a flying fish, an octopus, cuttlefish, baracuda as well as many many more types of fish. Those that wanted to were encouraged to get close to the fish, helping to identify them and throwing some to the ever eager seagulls flying and following in wait. Once the catch was in we moved off to a bay where you could swim, sunbathe or watch as the fish were sorted. Efi cooked the most amazing lunch seemingly effortlessly, everything freshly caught or home grown. We really couldn't have wished for more and certain my have never eaten that quality of fish before. Afterwards the children, having expressed an interest, were give rods and lots of help and encouargement to fish from the boat and had immediate success, this time returning the fish alive to the sea. Before returning to the harbour there was an additional opportunity to fish or swim and we had a delicious fruit salad. The best and most memorable part of the day though was Efi, Dimitrios and Mohammed themselves who couldn't have been more friendly, informative or helpful. From the warm welcome to the ongoing care and attention, the fishing lessons and fabulous hospitality we were thoroughly spoiled. They work so hard and deserve every success. "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/61JF2016,June 2017,5,Another fantastic trip!,"We went out with Efi, Dimitris and Mohammed on this trip last June and absolutely loved it. When we decided to come back to stay in lovely Katelios again this year we knew we had to do this trip again. We cannot recommend it highly enough. It's a great day out - you can help with getting fish out of the nets if you want to, swim in the beautiful water and then eat the fish which Efi cooks to perfection. A lovely relaxing day in great company!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tour605907,June 2017,5,2nd Trip ... just as fabulous as the 1st !!,This was our 2nd trip with Efi and Demitrios and was just as special as the 1st ! We had taken my 74 year old Mum along with us this time and after taking her to Fiskardo on a boat trip she was a little apprehensive due to the long day she had had on that boat trip ... however  she was delighted to have been part of what she described as a super day and the best day of the holiday !Efi and Demitrios along with Mohammed look after you so well and ensure your day is special for everyone on the boat.The trip this time took a different route to haul in the catch of hake ( along with mackerel octopus rep snapper) and we  yet again were taken to secluded beautiful bays to swim prior to lunch . Efi surpasses herself with the food she prepares .. all home grown and Demitrios is a wonder to look at preparing the fish caught for lunch ! I would never tire of this trip ... relaxing ... interesting and wonderful people !! My Mum can't wait to go back next year ! 
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahwU4227ZB,June 2017,5,Cannot recommend highly enough!,"I have to say, in all the years we have been coming to Kefalonia this is the BEST and funniest daytrip I have ever been on thanks to our wonderful hosts Efi Bacha Takidou and Dimitris Takidis and our lovely new friends Victoria, Simon, Sharon and Keith. We made the best memories with the best people.If you are ever in the area please check out Fishing Tourism and  Cruises Kefalonia, these guys are amazing. My cheeks actually hurt from smiling so much! We met at Katelios harbour just before 08:00 and were met with baked goods, Greek coffee and were introduced to our crew. Efi was the hostess with the most-ess, teaching us how to untangle the fish from the nets, telling us the type of fish we were dealing with (whilst making sure we stayed away from the poisonous scorpion fish!), serving us the most delicious homemade lemonade. The food was prepared for us while we snorkelled at a secluded private beach. Dimitri was fascinating to watch as he prepared the fish for cooking. We enjoyed several platters of the fish we had caught that morning along with fresh Greek salad, Efi's homemade potato salad and delicious anchovies. Dessert was a fresh fruit salad washed down with wine and ouzo.We returned to Katelios at 15:00 with full stomachs, grinning from ear to ear with wonderful memories of the perfect day and new friendships formed. We have already booked to go again tomorrow! Simply cannot wait!"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/r0sew00di,May 2017,5,Amazing Day,"We cannot recommend this experience enough! We were welcomed with coffee, juice and homemade cake and massive smiles. We helped take the fish out of the nets (maybe more of a hinderance), Efthimia, Mohammed and Dimitrios were extremely patient and very helpful, explaining lots of things as we went and were very attentive. This was followed by an amazing lunch, all cooked by Efthimia including the fresh fish caught that day, homemade lemonade, salt, wine, olive oil, fruit and veg and much more. We were part of a party of four and this is suited for all ages. I am pregnant and they were very caring and there was a young lad who was very keen on fishing so Dimitrios provided bate and helped with rods as  well as letting him drive the boat (if that's the correct term!). Overall we could not fault the experience and it was a fantastic end to our honeymoon. Thank you so much!! "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jdg73,May 2017,5,Catching lunch,"Highly recommended  - a great day out, Dimitrios and Efthimia run a very tight ship with skill and good humour. On this trip you experience the real life of a fisherman, visit beautiful places to swim, weather permitting, see lots of strange creatures from the deep and get to eat some of them beautify cooked by Efthimia.On our trip besides ourselves 74 and 68 there were another young couple with a boy of three and a baby of four months, all coped with, without fuss."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindseys535,May 2017,5,More of a food tour,"I selected this trip because we wanted to go deep sea fishing, but the only fishing we did was collecting the nets on the boat. After the initial disappointment we really had a wonderful time. Efi and Dimitrios were very kind and helpful. Efi prepared a delicious meal of Greek potatoes with the fish we caught in the nets. We swam at a beautiful beach and got to talk to learn a lot about what it is like living in Kefalonia as a fisherman. So this isn't really a fishing tour, but more of a food and culture tour on the Ionian Sea. With that in mind, this was a really wonderful experience and should definitely be on your list of things to do!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardsX8512XZ,May 2017,5,Not to be missed!!!!,"Just back in from a brilliant day out with Captain Dimitrios, Chef Efi & 1st Mate Mohammed.From the onset we were made welcome and certainly felt at home.Nothing too much trouble from this unique and very enjoyable venture, it might be a working boat but today we were the stars, seafood does not get any better and Efi knows how to present an excellent selection fresh out of the water, all accompanied with organic veg and salads from their garden, did I mention the wine and ouzo? or the homemade olive oil, vinaigrette, local salt the list goes on, extremely enjoyable and certainly a pleasure to be a part of.Don't change anything guys, this is pure gold.Most certainly a day to remember, any time your in Oz it's our shout.R & T."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankrT893OG,August 2016,5,Don't miss this tour when you visit Kefalonia!,First to say: We have a lot of experience of tours around the subject of ocean and fishing around the world. But what Efi & Dimitri are offering is a wonderful tour that we never had before. Tell them your wishes and they make them come true. For anybody who comes to Kefalonia don't miss this!!!
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike57d,September 2016,5,Unique,"Not really sure what to expect and having to be at the boat at 7.30am was not the holiday experience I was hoping for. However from reaching the beach and being greeted by a beautiful sunrise to meeting Efi, Dimitrios and his parents on the boat my concerns had disappeared. The hospitality and friendliness that was extended to us and our 2 other fellow fishermen knew no bounds. Other than the fish we caught ( I use the term we with tongue in cheek) every thing else we ate or drank was either grown in Efi's garden or they had made. Including the wine!!A truely great day and the only issue we had was we had to get off."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tour605907,September 2016,5,Perfect !,"From start to finish the day couldn't have been more perfect ! We were welcomed onto the boat by Efi  and Demetrios as if we were old friends and by the end of the day we certainly felt as if we had known them longer than a day. Efi and Demetrios along with Mohammed and Demetrios parent's made the day so wonderfully special. The hauling in of the fishing nets.. to us novices trying to get our catch (lunch )of Red snapper .. Sea bream ... Squid .. out of the nets ... very very  tricky but made to look so easy by Efi who I hasten to add had the patience of a saint with us when we seemed to get the fish more tangled up in the net's !!! We had 2 opportunities to cool off in the sea. Once in the morning we swam in the clearest blue water onto a little cove to dry off before swimming back to the boat for refreshments and again before lunch we anchored at another stunning cove where Demetrios Mum showed us how to use the clay from the beach to have a clay body scrub ... Just fabulous ! Lunch was cooked and served by Efi on the boat . The fish caught in the morning was cooked to perfection  the organic vegetables and salad all from Efi and Demetrios garden just delicious !! The wine served was another product of Efi and Demetrios making !! The day was definitely the most memorable of our holiday and one that when we return to Katelios we will do again !The only disappointing thing about this trip was that it ended too quickly and that Jame's (a fellow day tripper ) didn't catch any fish with his rod he had bought all the way from Scotland .. But at least Demetrios Dad got the use of the rod whilst we were swimming and the amazing man did catch a fish !!! Unique trip with great company. Thank you Efi, Demetrios , Demetrio's lovely parents and Mohammed !! "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cuckooscot,September 2016,5,The Best Day of our holiday,"From the very start of our day out until we left our hosts in the early afternoon, this was just a fantastic experience. We tried our hands at fishing ( harder than it looks!), steering the boat and just enjoying being on board with such hospitable and friendly hosts. Nothing seemed to be any trouble and we were entertained in lavish style...Effi cooked a feast from our catch of fish and plied us with lemonade ( made from her lemons) and wine ( from their own grapes). We swam from the boat to the shore and Dimitri's lovely mother who was with us showed how to have a mud spa on one of the shores. I could not recommend this more highly for a fun day out...whatever your age and fitness I can guarantee that you will leave feeling as we did, that we had sampled one of the very best experiences to be had in Greece. Big cheer Effi and Dimitri and thankyou for the wonderful memories."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesonraid,September 2016,5,Great day out!,"What a great day out with Dimitrios and Efi, they were such warm hosts, and couldn't do enough for us. It was really interesting and fun to see the catch brought in, and help the fisherman. Then while the catch was being prepared we visited private beaches, and even had a clay mask treatment with cephalonias, renowned nutrient rich clay. Then onto an amazing lunch of various fish caught that day, the freshest you can get, including cuttlefish, Greek style. Nearly all the ingredients including homemade wine and lemonade are grown organically on their small farm, which made for great fresh salads. It was a really fun day out, and a great way to experience Greek hospitality at its best."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R6847DUhelenl,August 2016,5,Fantastic trip with lovely hosts,Dimitris and Effi are part of the new fishing tourism in Greece - a most interesting way of getting out there to see what life for fishermen entails. Really educational and I'm bringing my children next year - they will love seeing the colourful and varied fish - and lobster- a lot of which is later cooked by the hosts and eaten on the boat. Just come with swimming regalia - and snorkel - jump off the back of the boat into the cerulean waters and you can swim whilst lunch is prepped. Best fish I've tasted and you struggle to find anything fresher. Katelios harbour is easy to find - there's a toilet on the boat - and everything very clean. Message Effi and she promptly replies. The return journey was really exhilarating when Dmitris turns up the engines. I felt a bit sick and Effi had far superior pills on offer than the ones I had at home. Thanks guys !!!! Yamas xxxx

It was so interesting to see the nets brought in with the wide variety of fish that was caught. We went swimming off the boat at a beautiful beach and then Efi cooked a delicious lunch using several types of the lovely fresh fish. It was the best fish I had ever tasted. I can highly recommend this trip. Efi and Dimitrios make you very welcome on their boat and make it a very enjoyable trip. If we go back there, we will definitely go on the trip again."
