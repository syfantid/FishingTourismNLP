Authentic boat trip,"What a day! We found this gem of a boat at the Adamantas port in Milos, after looking at many other options for a trip around the island and to the lovely beaches. Our initial impulse was to go on a sailboat- but they were fully booked. My husband and a friend found this little fishing boat, and spoke to the captain and his daughter. The boat will take 12 passengers, maximum. This appealed to us. They take you to the most famous of the Milos beaches. They take you out to line fish - and then prepare the fish on board for lunch in the Kleftiko bay. A glass of wine, a spot of ouzo for the brave, some of the most heart tugging music by a fellow passenger- and our day was complete. It will remain in my forever. Thank you to the staff for an amazing day.",Date of experience: August 2018,Milos Fishing Trip,4,"Milos, Greece"
Perfection,"Charisma suites was everything it said it was. Best location. Beautiful room. Clean. Modern. Spacious. The service provided by the beautiful Maria was excellent. Her dinner recommendations were perfect, the beach she sent us to was fabulous. The bar service and cocktails made by Arturo were great. The staff was polite, friendly and very fit ..... all those stairs! Highly recommended.",Date of stay: July 2018,Charisma Suites,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Great sunset,"Great sunset, but if you don’t have an hotel with a view, get there early. It gets busy! The atmosphere is festive and if you’re lucky, the sunset is spectacular. Even with clouds on the horizon it won’t disappoint. The loudspeaker make for the best colours, so don’t despair!",Date of experience: July 2018,Sunset in Oia,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Modern boutique hotel,"We recently stayed at the Thirides Beach Resort for a full week. It was our first visit, but won’t be our last! What a gem. Gorgeous room, clean, spacious, new. Comfortable beds and pillows, lovely view, spacious bathroom, great amenities. The restaurant on site was superb. We had two meals there, both poolside lunches, and they were a treat. Fresh pasta, with homemade seafood... yum. The beach is directly across the quiet sand road, comes with umbrellas and loungers. Get there early on weekends to reserve your spot- weekdays were quieter and we had no trouble finding a lounger. This is a great location from which to explore the local area. We will be back.",Date of stay: July 2018,Thirides Beach Resort,4,"Mavrovouni, Greece"

"Gorgeous, modern Greece","I arrived as part of a large girlfriends' cooking excursion, and couldn't have been happier. The hotel is modern, new, clean and perfectly situated. Think Restoration Hardware by the sea. Our meals were tasty, the cuisine contemporary , the portions perfect. Some of us booked a total body spa, and it was blissful. A lovely, albeit too short, stay. Two thumbs way up.",Date of stay: May 2016,Camvillia Resort Messinia,4,"Vounaria, Greece"
