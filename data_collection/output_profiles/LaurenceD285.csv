Great night,"Great service from Dan C and Karen - thanks for the great service! Friendly service, great tapas, warm log fire on a cold Barrow night - what's not to like? Ok Trip advisor, getting a bit bored of the 200 character requirement, I've said all I need to.",Date of stay: January 2020,The Duke of Edinburgh Hotel,1,"Barrow-in-Furness, United Kingdom"
Another great day!,"Our second trip with Efi and Dimitrios and this time was every bit as good as the first; starting with coffee and savouries then help pull in the nets and remove the fish. Off for a swim at one of the beautiful local beaches whilst Efi and Dimitrios clean the fish and prepare lunch.
Lunch is a selection of the catch, grilled and served with local grown salad and potatoes. After lunch a change of bay and more swimming, a light dessert of fruit then on to another bay for another swim before heading for home.
Efi and Dimitrios are the perfect hosts making you feel welcome and ensuring that you want for nothing.
Can't recommend highly enough, can't wait to see you next year!",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Great beer, great location","We were just in Middelkerke for one night and were looking for somewhere to have a beer before bed. Stumbled across this bar and what a great find it was! G it gets selection of beer, great atmosphere and a great evening. We stayed for more than just one beer!",Date of visit: March 2018,Den Toogoloog,1,"Middelkerke, Belgium"
"Great location, good hotel","Good hotel, quiet, comfortable beds, hot powerful shower, good continental breakfast. We arrived late but the hotel and room key were left in the key safe outside the hotel.
Hotel is located 2 minutes walk from the promenade and 5 minutes from the town centre where we found a great bar (Den Toogoloog) for a few well earned beers after the long drive.
Friendly hosts and great value for money, recommended.",Date of stay: March 2018,Hotel Honfleur,1,"Middelkerke, Belgium"
"Lovely food, great service","We tried the Katelios grill as a change from the waterfront tavernas and what a great decision it was. Great service, and the spit roast pork was delicious. We'll be back next year.",Date of visit: September 2016,Katelios Grill House,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Friendly, good food","This restaurant was close to our apartment so we decided to give it a go. It has a pleasant atmosphere with the eating area being on a covered terrace outside the building, surrounded by plants and greenery shielding it from the road.
Service was prompt and very friendly, food was very good.
Just loses one star for portion control! Not enough pitta bread served with the dips and when we asked for more bread we were asked 'how many portions'! Never been asked that question in Greece before.",Date of visit: September 2016,Jerry's Elliniko,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Didn't bother, wont be back","Walking past this restaurant we stopped to look at the fish cooler and menu. The manageress, as is traditional, explained what the fish were and what the specials were. We decided to walk on and thanked her for her time - the dirty, disdainful look she gave us was comical! The previous restaurant where we did the same, the waiter smiled and thanked is for looking. Thanks Captain Jerry's, we won't be back.",Date of visit: September 2016,Captain Jerry's,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Our favourite,"Visited the Lighthouse Restaurant many times on both of our stays in Katelios and it never fails to please. Friendly service from the family, good value and good choice. A free liqueur for us and a fruit cocktail for for the kids with the bill and even a complimentary bottle of fizz on our last night. Watching the geckos in the rafters chasing moths with the moon rising over the sea with great food and service makes for very special holiday memories; we'll be back!",Date of visit: September 2016,Lighthouse Taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great food,"Excellent resting point after a long walk. Great menu but go for the large milk shakes, small ones are tiny..
The toasted brie and cranberry panini was the best ever!",Date of experience: May 2015,The Old Station Tintern,1,"Tintern, United Kingdom"
A firm favourite,"I have eaten at the Jay Raj on 4 occasions with friends and on business; each time was a pleasure.
Service is discreet but attentive and swift. The staff are polite and courteous and on each visit the other customers have been good humoured and not too noisy making the Jay Raj a 'safe' place to take business colleagues in the evening.
Each time that we have visited when there have been a number of us, rather than ordering from the menu, we have requested a mix of starters and mains which always delivers surprises with dishes that one may not have otherwise chosen.
Dishes are good value for money - no unpleasant shock when the bill arrives!
Recommended; I am sure I will be back on my next visit to Luton.",Date of visit: May 2015,Jay Raj Indian Cuisine,1,"Luton, United Kingdom"
Button it!,"I have visited The Snow Centre twice now and have had the same good and not quite as good experiences on both occasions.
The good is that it is friendly, has a nice bar and viewing area for an apr√®s beer; ski and clothing hire is quick and efficient and there is plenty of parking outside.

Booking is fairly straightforward on the website though on the first visit trying to book the best prices for a group of 4 was a little challenging. Second visit the website had been updated with a simpler format, easier to navigate but cost a little more :-(

The slope is a good length and in the evenings (both of my sessions have been in the 8 to 10 pm slot) the snow is nicely chopped up giving a more 'realistic' and challenging piste.

And the not so good?
On the first visit the second button lift was closed at 9:30 resulting in much greater queuing times and a significant reduction in the amount of skiing in the final 30 minutes.
On the second visit the second lift was not running at all. Through most of the evening two staff members were standing at the top of the slope chatting so staffing levels did not seem to be an issue but it was a little frustrating having to queue when large groups of beginners are being taught how to use the buttons.

So overall, great fun, a very enjoyable way to spend an evening, just loses one rating point for being mean with your use of the second lift!",Date of experience: April 2014,The Snow Centre,1,"Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom"
Almost like the real thing!,"It has been too many years since I last skied so as the family had other plans I thought that I would take myself off to the Chill Factore. I selected a time on-line (13:30 to 15:30) on a Sunday afternoon and queued for a short while at the ticket desk before spotting the pre-paid ticket issuing machines next to the queue. Next onto the automatic foot / height / weight machine that determines boot & ski sizes and another short queue to wait for my skis.
The website suggests arriving an hour early and if you are hiring clothes, boots and skis then this is probably about right; I took salopettes but next time will probably just take waterproof overtrousers as it is not too cold on the slope.
And so to the important bit - the skiing...well, as many have commented, the car park is too small and this gave the impression that the slope would be crowded - but it wasn't. Short lift queues, sometimes none at all. The 'snow' is more like finely crushed ice - not quite like the real thing, but much closer than the feel of a dry slope. The length is good; it is possible to either link many short turns or sweep down in a series of long carved turns. After five or six descents my legs had started to remember and by the end of two hours I was really enjoying myself.
Negatives? Not many really. The advanced skiers button lift on the far side of the slope could be faster - it takes over a minute from bottom to top so this eats into your allotted time quite a bit. My 'lift pass' (a barcode ticket) ripped off my string within 10 uses so it had to go inside my pocket resulting in much fumbling with pockets each time it was needed. Finally - a bench at the bottom, or top, to sit and watch or catch breath in mid-ski would be nice.
Overall a good day out and the closest thing to real skiing in the North West.",Date of experience: March 2014,Chill Factore,1,"Stretford, United Kingdom"
Friendly and warm,"Heading back up to Liverpool from the Forest of Dean, we decided to take a different route to the usual motorway drive and were looking out for a suitable pub to stop at for lunch.
Spotting the Colliers Arms we thought we had found just that but we were wrong! The log burning stove and bright interior was unusual and not what we expected. Friendly service and good food - albeit just a light lunch - was so much better than the motorway services that would have been the alternative had we taken the normal route.
The Colliers Arms has a slight identity crisis, combining bar, cafe, restaurant and small local produce general store - but it is none the worse for that; its diversity provides part of its charm and if we ever return to that part of the country, we will call in for lunch again!",Date of visit: October 2012,The Colliers Farm Shop and Tea Room,1,"Clows Top, United Kingdom"
