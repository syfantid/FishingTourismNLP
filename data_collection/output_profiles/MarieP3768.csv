"Good location, clean and comfortable.","Met our expectations for a clean well appointed hotel. However, when we called to add an extra day the hotel charged us more than the quoted rate on Expedia. They would not honor the Expedia rate at checkout. Lesson learned. Book on line, not directly with hotel. Our key stopped working twice as the hotel expected us to check out. Apparently front desk did not adjust checkout time on the key to the new reservation. Small annoyance.",Date of stay: July 2019,The Athens Gate Hotel,4,"Athens, Greece"
Amazing resort with natural thermal water pools,"We stayed at the Four Seasons outside of Athens in Vouliagmeni for 5x the price and this resort is equal to the experience and in some ways better due to the thermal waters, although the views of the sea are better in Vouliagmeni. Indoor and outdoor pools are filled daily with natural warm thermal spring waters. A full service spa. Delicious dining experience. We came last year and will plan to come again next year.",Date of stay: July 2019,Thermae Sylla Spa & Wellness Hotel,4,"Edipsos, Greece"
"First time in Milos, won’t be the last.",We enjoyed a wonderful week at the Ostria Vento. Elpitha made us feel welcome and totally at home from the first day.

Wonderful day!,"Enjoyed a lovely day with Capt Niko, his wife Frossa and 5 other friendly and interesting newly made friends. We were 9 total on this fishing boat, enjoying the amazing waters of Polyaigos and Kimolos. Every beach a wonder. Clean clear salty waters in semiprivate/private coves where you can swim to the beach and simply relax. A delicious meal was prepared from fish freshly brought on board by net. The hours passed peacefully and enjoyably. Looking forward to a return trip already.",Date of experience: June 2019,Milos Fishing Experience,4,"Milos, Greece"
Peaceful paradise,Seaview rooms with balcony. Beautiful hotel found down a rutted road that brings you to paradise. True farm to table dining. Wonderful friendly staff. Owner Semi is a great cook while her husband Achilles cares for the farm. Lovely hotel.,Date of stay: August 2018,Faros,4,"Pilio, Greece"
A Hidden Gem,"Away from site, just behind a nondescript building of commercial use and down uneven and uninviting steps you are greeted by lovely wooden doors. Open them to find beautifully crafted stone steps, a view that hits you like a dozen butterflys and magnificent stone houses. The owner Eleni is a gracious hostess that will ensure your comfort. The wood and stone were crafted with love by her husband. The rooms are lovely, clean and comfortable. The mountain village is traditional with a large platea and many restaurants. Truly a hidden gem.",Date of stay: August 2018,Archontiko Koti,4,"Agios Lavrentios, Greece"
Always amazing,We never tire of returning here. The traditional homes are fully equipped and aesthetically pleasing. Maria tends to our every need. Staying here is a wonderful experience you won’t forget. We take a catamaran to experience the beautiful waters around the island. I’d avoid the beaches and swim off the boat. We loved the restaurant Metaxi Mas. Maria can arrange transportation there and back.,Date of stay: August 2018,Lithies Traditional Homes,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Our second time,"Sailed on the Triton in 2016 with Capt Theo and loved it so much sailed again yesterday. This is the best way to experience Santorini.

Exceeds your expectations",Date of experience: August 2018,Santorini Sailing,4,"Santorini, Greece"

Near Kennedy Center,Enjoyed our visit. Friendly helpful front desk. Spacious and clean room with kitchen. Comfortable bed and linens. Pull out couch for our son was fine.

Lovely B & B,"Highly recommend this grand, beautifully restored B & B with plenty of privacy and a warm, inviting, informative innkeeper and staff. The home is conveniently located within easy walking distance to the park and squares. There is the option to take the nearby free shuttle around the historic district of Savannah.

Surpassed my expectations,"On our road trip from NJ to Florida my husband and I decided to stay for the night at the highly recommended Belmond in Charleston. We’re so glad we did. We were unexpectedly upgraded to the concierge floor. We enjoyed very much the salt water indoor pool that was immaculately clean and just the right temperature, the friendly and ever accommodating staff, the exquisite facility, comfortable and well appointed room, the delicious food and the convenient location. Five stars in anyone’s book. Well worth it.",Date of stay: April 2018,Belmond Charleston Place,4,"Charleston, South Carolina"
