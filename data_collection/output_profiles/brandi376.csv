Delicious and fresh,This was definitely a 5-star service. Very refined and fresh. You could taste the passion for cooking. Definitely recommend going.,Date of visit: September 2020,Valaora Resto Nafplio,1,"Nafplio, Greece"
Terrible service,"Had a reservation for 2 days and arrived to the counter with 15 mins late. Other clients being in front of us, the agent not only said that the car rented was not available but we have to paid 30 euros extra per day for a upper class...
First of all, in our reservation it is mentioned that we receive the car we choose OR similar... why would we have to paid extra??
Second, the agent at Zaventem was very condescending to us and showed no flexibility whatsoever.
Third, calling another agent for clarification, was at the end no help and only made us cancel our reservation. Apparently the agent at the airport had indicated in the system that we were over an hour late... what a lie and lake of professionalism!
I am not surprised why Sixt has such a bad reputation... Looking at their Facebook page, Yelp on Google review, Sixt does not have good reviews.
For our concern, this will be a NEVER AGAIN situation!",,Sixt - Brussels Airport,1,"Zaventem, Belgium"
Super,"Super is the word! A must do when in Istanbul. Staff is nice, the hammam is clean and cosy. Price is good for what you get.",Date of experience: September 2019,Cagaloglu Hamami,1,"Istanbul, Turkey"
Exceptional,"I've been to Paris quite a lot and the Flanelle Hotel is by far the best hotel I've stayed in. Absolutely everything was GREAT.
Situated in a calm street, only 3 mins away from the Arc de Triomphe and subway stop ""Charles de Gaulle – Étoile"" and 5 mins away from the Avenue des Champs Elysées.
The staff (literally everyone) is super friendly, attentive and caring of their clients. It is obvious that they are happy to work together and for this hotel.
We loved everything about our room: cosy, perfectly decorated (just what you need to have to make it feel like home), AC/heater, quiet, TV with internet browser, weather and flights information. The shower was amazing and brand new. The bed and pillows were super comfortable. Rooms are refreshed/cleaned everyday.
Breakfast (Continental) has everything you need/want: freshly baked Baguette and Croissant, fresh orange jus and detox jus, eggs/omelette (how ever you want them), cheese, salmon, toast, yogurt, crêpes... and way more!
The Hotel in itself makes you feel like at home. There is (free) sauna and hammam (perfect for 2) available (upon reservation so it is cleaned for the next use), there is beverage (water, hot drinks (free) wine and cocktails) available at anytime if needed, snacks (cake).... Room Service is also available too.
Definitely worth staying here, you will not regret.",Date of stay: August 2020,Hotel Flanelles Paris,1,"Paris, France"
Great experience,"Vasilis and Andonis are really great! Having no experience in fishing, they tough us how to fish and of course we all managed to catch something lol or at least to get the feeling of it. We had a great time and of course eating BBQ fish on the boat was such cool experience. Definitely recommend doing this with the duo, good family vibes. Thank you again :-)",Date of experience: September 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Trendy spot,Really nice spot on the rooftop. Design chicha (hookah) with funky flavors. Food is good Service is good. The view is good. Relax atmosphere. Definitely worth trying at least once.,Date of visit: September 2019,Lotiz Lounge & Hookah,1,"Istanbul, Turkey"
Bon et cosy,"Chouette petit spot pour casser la croûte et/ou (petit-)déjeuner ou encore tout simplement prendre un jus, café, thé. Le gérant (et serveur) est vraiment accueilant, amicale et au petit soin des clients.",Date of visit: September 2019,Terrace Coffee & Snacks,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Au top,"Vous visitez Rhodes ? Un must ! La Ronda a tout pour plaire ! L'ambiance, la déco, la musique lounch, la situation (au bord de plage) le service (et son suivie) et biensûr la cuisine: un vrai régale. Vous ne regretterez pas! Les prix sont tout à fait abordable! Bonne App !",Date of visit: September 2019,Ronda Restaurant & Beach Bar,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Super!,"EN: We had initially booked a Twin room and when checking-in, the receptionist surprised us with good news that as it was our first time, our room had been upgraded to a Privilege Double Room (with a nice view on the Eiffel Tour). So again thank you very much :-) The rooms are very well sound-proof. Atrium Hotel is well situated in a calm and safe area - only 2 minutes walk from the Tram T2 - 3 stops from La Défense - or 5 stops from la Seine Musicale if you are going to see a concert. All is all, the perfect spot for a relax and cosy stay. Breakfast was good as well. I recommend.
FR: Nous avions initialement réservé une chambre double et lors de l'enregistrement, la réceptionniste nous a surpris avec une bonne nouvelle: comme c'était notre première fois, notre chambre avait été surclassée dans une chambre privilège (avec une belle vue sur la Tour Eiffel). Encore une fois merci beaucoup :-) Les chambres sont très bien insonorisées. L'hôtel Atrium est bien situé dans un quartier calme et sécurisé - à seulement 2 minutes à pied du tramway T2 - à 3 arrêts de La Défense - ou encore à 5 arrêts de la Seine Musicale si vous assistez à un concert. En tout pour tout, un endroit idéal pour un séjour relaxant et confortable. Le petit déjeuner était également bon. Je recommande.",Date of stay: July 2019,Atrium Hotel,1,"Suresnes, France"
