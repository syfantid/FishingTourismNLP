GOOD TO BE BACK,"Yet again, amazing service, brilliant food and so glad this restaurant is open for business. Been here several times and never disappoints. Staff very friendly and polite and the food is amazing. Varied menu which gives customers a wide range of choice of meals to pick from. The saffron rice and breads they offer are to die for. Started with the Fattoush salad followed by Chicken Soltani, a skewer of marinated chicken and a skewer of minced lamb kebab (pic).

REALLY ENJOYABLE FOUR DAY STAY,"Very impressed overall with the complex. Very clean accommodation, excellent choice of food and good location in relation to other amenities. Would recommend paying extra for the pool view. Rooms are excellent size if a little dated. Our only criticism is that there is only one bar which is located near the large pool where the entertainment takes place on an evening. If you don't want to be involved with the entertainment then there isn't anywhere else to sit which is convenient to the where the bar is. You can get refreshments from the restaurant but the complex could do with a bar at the smaller pool which only offers tea and coffee during the day. Would definitely return. Thanks to all the staff who were really friendly and courteous all the time.",Date of stay: January 2020,Club Caleta Dorada,5,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
AMAZING DAY,All I can say is that this was one of the best trips I have ever done on a holiday abroad. Experience life on a real fishing boat and be fed by what you catch on the day. Food is amazing. A big thank you to Antonia and Michalis - totally charming and extremely friendly. Good luck with your business.

Excellent Break,"Went to the Yel last month. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay with two other friends travelling with us. Not a lot to fault with the complex, weather amazing, views brilliant, excellent cuisine and plenty to do. Two days before the end of the holiday Thomas Cook went bust, we knew it was a gamble booking with them, but it still felt worrying being in a foreign country with no knowledge of what was going to happen. We heard horror stories about guests in other countries been held ransom until payments were made - not here! The management could not have been more helpful, a credit to the Turkish people. Thank you for making our final two days a lot more relaxing than we thought they were going to be. I hope you recover from the Thomas Cook fiasco.",Date of stay: September 2019,Yel Holiday Resort,5,"Oludeniz, Turkey"
AMAZING RESTAURANT,"Visited this restaurant twice during September, sorry for the delay in writing a review! Absolute gem of a restaurant, the food on offer is varied and the tastes of the authentic Persian dishes was amazing. The staff who work there are so friendly and very accommodating. Breads are a must to accompany your main meal, and so cheap! No alcohol licence but the owners are more than happy for you to bring your own drinks into the restaurant and they provide the glasses! Can definitely recommend the Gheimeh Bademjun, diced lamb cooked in tomatoes with aubergine
- one of the tastiest sauces I have tried from any country. Don't bother ordering a starter the staff bring you a small starter salad which is more than enough. We will definitely be visiting again. Thank you for a wonderful dining expererience.",Date of visit: September 2017,Persian Cottage,5,"Middlesbrough, United Kingdom"
"AMAZING HOLIDAY, AMAZING HOTEL","Went to The Thalassi late May, only just got round to writing a review, sorry Eva!
What more can I say that hasn't been said already on the reviews. Dimitri and Eva are both charming and make sure you want for nothing, advice and help is always at hand. It's a small and friendly hotel so don't complain if you are looking for a hotel with all bells and whistles. This holiday is about experiencing true Crete charm - the guests at the hotel appreciate this, ask how many are returning for the umpteenth time. I don't wish to repeat what most people have said - all I can say is go and experience it. The island is beautiful, the hotel area is quiet and safe and the hosts are amazing. What more do you want? Just book it!
