They decorated the table so beautifully.,Date of visit: August 2020,Wine & Roses,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Nice experience,"We came here on midsummer night while sun was shining and we thought that we would be the only customers, but luckily we weren´t. The restaurant is stylish and waiters very attentive and friendly. Like it should in a place like this. We had a tasting menu (the only choice like we knew) with a bottle of wine. Fresh local ingredients. Pike caught by the main chef him self. Amazing techniques being used. Not all was our cup of tea, but over all we were satisfied. Over 3 hours well spent.",Date of visit: June 2020,Restaurant O,4,"Tallinn, Estonia"
Do not miss this unique experience,This was the place to be under MCO - and why not always. With one word: AMAZING. Breathtaking view. You can spot kind and polite dusky leaf monkeys playing in the trees and eagles flying in front of your nose. At the night time green lights of squid fishers in the silence. Staff is unbelievable. Room service bringing treats and tasty food. Our best experience ever! Humble thanks to the whole crew. We love you all. Hope that we meet again!,Date of stay: April 2020,Ambong Pool Villas Langkawi,4,"Langkawi, Malaysia"
"First time at a private pool villa, but not last. Amazing!","Maneh Villa was just opened few weeks before, so there was only couple of reviews. Because we were staying near Maneh Villa, we checked it out in before hand. Beautiful settings and very warm welcoming encouraged us to book a Deluxe Villa. This was worth it. We enjoyed a great service in luxury surroundings. Best experience ever. Splendid isolation and peaceful, but nice restaurants, shops and the beach very near within 5-10 minutes walk. Breakfast was served to the villa so politely and it was just perfect. Wish that we could have stayed longer. Some small things only: there was no place to dry clothes or towels on the patio. Strongly recommend!",Date of stay: March 2020,Maneh Villa Langkawi - Private Pool,4,"Langkawi, Malaysia"

A day like a dream,Genuine greek hospitality by Nancy and Giannis. Come as a guest leave as a friend is once again true:) It was exciting to try fishing guided by professionals.

Surreal beauty and peace,"Santorini is so busy today, but at our house it was so peaceful. The view to Caldera is really amazing. Beautiful sunset on our own terrace. We stayed for two weeks and didn´t get tired watching the view. The room is cosy and you have everything you need. Small pool was a plus. Nice restaurants and super markets near. Everything worked perfectly. Anna replied always very quickly and Nana did her part with happy face. Bidet would have been very nice and a better volume in hair dryer. These are no big problems and we can really recommend this unique house.",Date of stay: August 2018,Santorini-Hara's houses no4,4,"Santorini, Greece"

Loistava kokonaisuus,"Ihan arki-illan ratoksi lähdettiin nautiskelemaan Butter Chickeniä uudempaan Nepaliaiseen. Ulospäin ei niin houkutteleva, mutta palvelu ja ruoka viimeisen päälle. Naan-leipä ja tomaattichutney täydensi maukkaat kanat. Sisätila näytti viihtyisältä Hintatasokin kohtuullinen. Suosittelemme ja tulemme uudestaan. Kiitos taas tripin arvostelijoille, että osattiin tulla kokeilemaan.",Date of visit: August 2018,Koseli,4,"Vantaa, Finland"
Great experience!,"We don´t like crowds so we decided to have a private Sunset Dinner Cruise to celebrate our 6th anniversary. We invited our friends from Cactus Inn to tag along with sponsored price. When Chrystal Yachts booker heard that we are from Finland they organized their Finnish crew member Anniina to host us. Kiitos Anniina! We were her first Finnish customers! The whole crew: Captain Sparrow and Chef Aui were so perfect. Dinner was great, Pina Colada tasty (maybe too tasty) and beer really cold. We also had sparkling wine as a special surprise from the Company. The ""net swimming"" was maybe the funniest!",Date of experience: March 2018,Sunset Dinner Cruise Langkawi,4,"Langkawi, Malaysia"
Not our cup of tea,Wanted to see this top rank restaurant. Beautiful and nice ambience. Friendly service. Our meal was not special and a little bit overpriced.,Date of visit: March 2018,Pia's The Padi,4,"Langkawi, Malaysia"
"Beautiful place, beautiful food, beautiful service","Always when you come to a top rated restaurant, you have so high expectation that it´s a challenge to meet them. Even better than we expected. Kebaya did not have any problem with this. The four course dinner was perfect. Maybe the best food ever. We strongly recommend: don´t miss this unique place. Chris Ong designs his heritage hotels and restaurants with taste and the staff in all three places we visited is highly motivated and professional.",Date of visit: March 2018,Kebaya,4,"Penang Island, Malaysia"
Kaunis perinnehotelli nykyaikaisin mukavuuksin ja loistava palvelu,"Saimme normihuoneen sijaan 2-kerroksisen huoneiston, jossa pieni piha ulkosuihkulla. Yllättävän upea kokemus käydä alasti suihkussa taivaan alla. Kaunis rakennus ja sisustus sekä vertaansa vailla oleva palvelu. Sijainti sopivasti George Townin kupeessa. Aamupala mannermainen paikallisella twistillä. Sanonta: ""Tule vieraana ja lähde ystävänä"" toteutui kyllä täysin. Kertakaikkiaan tyylikäs paikka. Omistaja Chris Ong on toteuttanut useita tällaisia projekteja kotikonnuilleen todella onnistuneesti. Tutustuimme Seven Terraceen, Kebayaan ja Muntri Mewhin myös. Vinkki:tämän hotellin asukkaana voit tilata ravintola Kebayasta myös a la carte -listalta jos et halua koko illallissettiä. Suosittelemme kyllä koko ateriaa. Tämän hotellin ravintola oli lupia vaille valmis, joten hotellin palvelut vaan paranevat.",Date of stay: March 2018,Jawi Peranakan Mansion,4,"Penang Island, Malaysia"
What a pleasant surprice! Very stylish and welcoming.,We just stopped for a happy hour cocktails. We were stunned by the interior and all the details and decorations!

Just what we expected in a good location,We were satisfied with the apartment and the view. And of course we must say thank´s to the Krisa and her family for great service. The kitchenette was a little bit unpractical to use. Missed a place to slice the bread. The wifi was working so so some times. The bar should have more snacks than just peanuts.Would come again.,Date of stay: August 2017,Socrates Luxurious Studios & Apartments,4,"Kárpathos, Greece"

Fell in love to sushi and Stacey's,"Booked a table two earlier on the balcony. It was worth it. Nice view and ambience. We came in time but we had to wait a while. Had GTs on the house. We have tasted sushi years ago and now decided to try again. Beautiful and delicious. Desert on a stone with dusted Karpathos image was amazing.

Not a great price quality ratio,Passed this nice looking little restaurant many times and finally decided to have breakfast here. Surroundings and service was nice but to our opinion poor selection of breakfast and prices too high.,Date of visit: April 2017,Yam Yam Cafe & Restaurant,4,"Langkawi, Malaysia"
Great indian,We stayed in hotel nearby. We noticed that they have a table on the street walk that you can have a dinner and smoke. What a rare luxury in Singapore:) The young indian manager was very kind and service was perfect. We had the butter chicken twice and it was very tasty. Reasonable prices. There was a buffet inside. Seemed popular too.,Date of visit: March 2017,Riverwalk Tandoor,4,"Singapore, Singapore"
"Charming unique ambience, great food and service, low prices. All you need.","After 7 weeks stay and maybe 60 visits to this lovely restaurant, we really love this place. Breakfast every day from 8 AM to 1 PM (lots of choices) and dinner from 4 PM to 11 PM (Wednesdays closed). Lip, Fika, Liu and the whole crew serves you dinner in a relaxed friendly way. Seafood, chicken, beef, spaghetti, Asian, European - your name it, they got it. But don´t expect to find pizza or burgers here. Wines, cointreau, brandy and GT are not on the menu, but they have it. All prices are more than reasonable. Everybody loves this place: you find same faces night after night.",Date of visit: February 2017,Cactus Restaurant,4,"Langkawi, Malaysia"
"Rustic charm, excellent stuff, convenient rooms","This small hotel has a great location near the Tengah (which we prefer to Cenang) beach and many restaurants. The room is basic, but it covers all the needs. AC is working allright and the king size bed in room nr 3 is great. Not to mention great staff: Lip, Liu and Fika and all the rest. It feels like home. Wifi is not perfect but good enough - it´s not easy to find better at this area. Even the construction site (we were kindly informed about it in before hand) doesn`t bother us, but we can imagine what a paradise this must have been before that. The restaurant Cactus crowns the whole thing. We´ve been here fot 3 weeks and we have 2 months to go!",Date of stay: February 2017,Cactus Inn,4,"Langkawi, Malaysia"
Special intimate dinner,We came here to celebrate our birthday by having a tasting menu because we both want to experience many kind of tastes. And we did. Everything was good and the portions were just about the right size. The service was attentive and in the end we got small surprise gifts. We recommend all thought it was a bit far from our hotel in the old town.,Date of visit: November 2016,International Rīga,4,"Riga, Latvia"
OK italian,Nice looking place and quite OK pasta and lasagne. Moderate prices. Berry tiramisu and cheese cake good. Maybe too big. Should have shared. Price quality ratio and service good. The limoncello was not to my taste and I have had those quite many.,Date of visit: November 2016,Il Patio,4,"Riga, Latvia"
Good Indian food,We had chicken tikka Masala. I am used to eat spicy so I ordered one. That was my mistake. My wife's medium would have been spicy enough for me and for her the milder version. Service was good. The lightning could have been more dimmed.,Date of visit: November 2016,Singh's,4,"Riga, Latvia"
Good location,Nice old style interior and clean rooms. Location near the old town restaurants. Easy to access from the airport by bus nr 22. You can here people from the other rooms but we didn'the mind. The breakfast till 11 and that was great and you got the basic elemends of the breakfast allright. With bubbling:) The mattress was a bit too hard and the pillows were too thin. Other wise the room was big and nice.,Date of stay: November 2016,Rixwell Old Riga Palace Hotel,4,"Riga, Latvia"
Nice ambience and great service,"Latvian cider for a drink. Tasty. Dark garlic bread for a starter. Very tasty. Chicken breast and risotto for main. Beautiful portions, but needed more spices.

As great as one could expect,"We spent two weeks in this small village. Luckily and finaly we decided to try this number 1 ranked. We thought that it would be too fine dining for us. Not at all. Food was great, service perfect and atmosphere relaxed. We shared gratinated mussels for a starter. For main course we had two different chicken portions - simple but amazing taste. They have two seatings and the place is not very big so we recommend that you book the table in advance.",Date of visit: August 2016,La Terrasse Restaurant,4,"Thásos, Greece"

Left as friends...,"After a long journey from Hua Hin by taxi and ferry we felt welcome right away. Had some welcoming drinks and chatted with the manager Nick. And Nay was amazing. To us Nay was the key person. He made us feel welcome every day. ""Come as a guest and leave as a friend"". Indeed we did. The villa was as good as we expected. This is a place for families with children. We adult couples maybe need more privacy. That was our mistake. But anyway we enjoyed our stay for 39 nights and had many great lunches and dinners in the resorts restaurant. Chef was great. The last pizza had a text ""Good luck"" written on it and was served with a smile like always. The cleaning was not perfect, but it was done daily, so it was OK. The Fisherman´s village was close enough, 10 minutes walking, but the road was a bit bumpy and in the night time too dark. We would recommend the pool side villa for families or people who don´t mind about children running and screaming round the pool. Best regards to Nick, Nay and the rest of the crew from Kiira and Mikko from Finland.",Date of stay: February 2016,Dreams Villa Resort,4,"Bophut, Thailand"
Private heaven on the beach,The road to Zenzibar was through a jungle (maybe 200 meters from the main road) but it was worth it. Small and cosy restaurant right on the beach. We had prawns and snapper whit pepper and garlic sauce as the main food and bacon/ prawns crepes as starter. Desert also great. Delicious. Sun set gave us a blue moment of a life time. Perfect. After the storm they had fixed the place all right. Check this place and you won´t regret. Than you Yuyth.

Casa Bianca met the high expectations,"After reading the good reviews we had high expectations. We were not disappointed. Our room was on the 2nd floor with big private terrace with sunbeds and great views. Most clean place ever. Staff brilliant - special thanks to Antonia and Donna. No Caldera view but it is only 1 minute walk from Caldera. Also Imerovigli is a great town to be. It´s peaceful and only 15 minutes walk to Fira. We also recommend a bus trip to Oia. We spent two weeks in Casa Bianca - best experience was sunset sailing Antonia booked us. A bit expensive 115 €/each including transfer, BBQ and wine/beer. If we come to Santorini some day (we hope), we´ll stay in Casa Bianca.",Date of stay: August 2014,Casa Bianca,4,"Santorini, Greece"

Good welcoming but overall bad experience,We got some dishes we did not order. The curry chicken was tasteless and the bill included the dishes we did not order. Not our cup of tee this time. Don´t recommend.,Date of visit: August 2015,Taverna Vassilis,4,"Naxos, Greece"
Great experience,Luckily there was a girl marketing this 9D movie when we took a tour with the mini train. Special price 5 €/person when you have the train ticket. We took the offer and don´t regret it. 20 minutes of amazing visions and a glimpse to the the Rhodes history. Strongly recommend. Kiira and Mikko.,Date of experience: June 2015,Throne of Helios,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great pizza and good service,Just wanted to have quick afternoon snack. Thank´s again to TripAdvisor we found this nice pizza place just round the corner. If you want a quick snack in a nice place go there! Easygoing service.,Date of visit: June 2015,Antony Restaurant & Pizzeria & Grill House,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
"Tasty food, nice atmosphere and service",We looked the menu in the internet and we were little bit disappointed because there was no chicken foods on it. Luckily the menu in the restaurant was much better. Great chicken nuggets in curry sauce (real chicken) and breaded chicken with mushrooms. Very tasty and big portions enough. Recommended by Kiira and Mikko.,Date of visit: June 2015,Restaurant Agalma,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Excellent tapas and great service,"We must thank Tripadvisor again that we found this lovely small restaurant during our day visit in Puerto de Mogan. We spent easily almost three hours with tapas and a glass of red wine. Desert creme brule avec cortado con limoncello and interesting discussion with the owner Chris and ""half gipsy"" waitor. Thank you guys and good luck in the singing competition to your daughter. We´ll be back with our friends.",Date of visit: March 2015,The Olivia Lounge,4,"Gran Canaria, Spain"
Casa Bianca met the high expectations,"After reading the good reviews we had high expectations. We were not disappointed. Our room was on the 2nd floor with big private terrace with sunbeds and great views. Most clean place ever. Staff brilliant - special thanks to Antonia and Donna. No Caldera view but it is only 1 minute walk from Caldera. Also Imerovigli is a great town to be. It´s peaceful and only 15 minutes walk to Fira. We also recommend a bus trip to Oia. We spent two weeks in Casa Bianca - best experience was sunset sailing Antonia booked us. A bit expensive 115 €/each including transfer, BBQ and wine/beer. If we come to Santorini some day (we hope), we´ll stay in Casa Bianca.",Date of stay: August 2014,Casa Bianca,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Great food overwhelming service,"At the day time La Maison does not look like any special but in the evening it turns into a romantic restaurant. Great service, great innovative menu and not too pricy. Recommend.",Date of visit: August 2014,La Maison,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Romantic dinner restaurant,"Great food, nice atmosphere, not too expensive. Recommend. Book in advance in sunset time. The 1st floor was our choice.",Date of visit: August 2014,Mezzo Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"

We recommend definitively!",Date of experience: August 2014,Barca Sailing,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Excellent service,"Atmosphere like in a lunch restaurant - would have been much better with less light and some candles. Sweet & Sour chicken good, but curry chicken little tasteless. When we gave the feed back, supervisor came to us and was sorry. We got a dessert cheese cake for free, nice! Would recommend.",Date of visit: December 2013,The Pelican Grill,4,Jamaica
Excellent pasta and pizza,"Probably the best pizza and pasta ever. And the cherry cheese cake unbelievable. Moderate prices, good service. Music was not suitable for an Italian restaurant. We would recommend absolutely.",Date of visit: December 2013,Kenny's Italian Cafe,4,Jamaica
Would come again,Nice location on the beach. Safe and clean. New well maintained property. Great a/c and shower. Continental breakfast would have been perfect if an egg included. We recommend absolutely. Moderate price: 80 $ including continental breakfast.,Date of stay: December 2013,Rooms on the Beach Negril,4,Jamaica
Cosy and perfect,"It´s just perfect a combination of atmosphere, service and location in a moderate price. If we ever go to Mexico City we will stay in Casa Comtesse. Thank You Thomas and the Crew. Kaisa ja Mikko from Finland;)",Date of stay: September 2010,Casa Comtesse,4,"Mexico City, Mexico"
