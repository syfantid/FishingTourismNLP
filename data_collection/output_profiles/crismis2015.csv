Perfect stay !,"My husband and I recently stayed at Diana Studios for 7 nights. Our stay was incredible. The studios are simple but elegant, the pool is very nice, and the common areas are perfect. The manager Alex is a very special person, very kind and always accommodating for any needs. I was a bit sick the first few days of my stay, and he made sure I was always taken care of, he even went to the pharmacy to get some medicine for me. We were given great recommendations to visit the islands, and we felt very comfortable there. The location is perfect to view many areas of the island. Argostoli, the main town, is only 15 minutes away, so very convenient. One evening Alex and his family hosted a dinner for all hotel guests, and the mean was excellent, everything was fresh and cooked with love. We are so humbled by the kind hospitality Diana Studios offered us and we will definitely recommend it to all of our friends! THANK YOU SO MUCH for making our vacation stay just perfect!!! see you soon!!!",Date of stay: July 2018,Diana Studios,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Famous Lassi in Varanasi!,Very good tasting! A bit heavier than Bana Lassi. I personally preferred Bana Lassi in Varanasi but Blue Lassi is certainly an institution.,Date of visit: April 2016,Blue Lassi,1,"Varanasi, India"

"Nice appearance, poor service","I stayed at Ace Hotel DTLA for 3 nights during fashion market week in October. The choice for hotels downtown LA is a bit scarce, so, because of market and location convenience I decided to stay here. I brought the collection with me to invite buyers to view.

Check IN : check in staff not very welcoming and a bit standoffish. Like they are too cool for taking the time to check you in. I asked : is this where you check in? And she responded : have you already checked in ... hhhmmm..

It was 12 pm, I arrived from NYC, but the room was not ready. Ok, I was able to check in at 3 or so when they called me to let me know the room was (finally) ready.
When I first arrived I inquired about my package which I had shipped from NYC a few days earlier : fed ex had informed me it was delivered and I called the hotel to confirm they received the day before my departure. They told me ""all is good""-. Well, they could not find my package until 6 pm, and I had to call 3 times for it.

The room : it was ok, very small compared to hotel like standard, and others. Cozy but small, not too many amenities, sure, with nice character. No one walked me to the room, no welcome of any sorts. I spent 1,300 for 3 nights... I was expecting a warmer welcome that just ""here's the key, enjoy"". Especially being that it was my very first visit.

The breakfast restaurant: decent, not excellent for the price But there is not much choice around so you are a bit stuck there. Overall pleasant.

Check out : this is where things get interesting. I asked at front desk that I had a package ready wrapped up with ground label to ship back to NYC. At front desk they told me to ask one of the guys at the door, so I did, ""yes, sure no problem we will get this for you? What room, sure ok , done. So I checked out and left.

Upon my return to NYC, I was expecting my package to return, but only a week later I found out that it never left Ace Hotel. So I call once, no one knows of my package again for 2 days, no call back. I talk to front desk, they tell me I need to speak with Eric at guest services. Eric sounds bothered by my requests, and to make the story short tells me that it was my fault because I put together the package wrong and there was no label. WIth a week of back and forth, I specifically asked that they find the box and my collection was in there, and it was quite important.

Finally 10 days later the box is found, re-packed by Eric and shipped. I asked this to be shipped ground with my account , and they shipped express which cost me double what I was expecting. I called to inform the extra charge I had to pay: and I got yelled at the phone for being ""condescending"" and that "" they are NOT RESPONSIBLE for guests packages, and that oh well "" I told you it was going to be expressed"" .

No one , I repeat No one, called me to make sure I received the package ok,, or to apologize for the inconvenience. I asked Eric what the hotel would do about the extra charges and for the trouble of someone that obliviously misplaced the box, no help whatsoever. I actually was told I should ""thank them"" that they did not throw away the package.

I have been in this business for over 5 years and have shown the collection twice a year in LA. I have NEVER experienced this type of problem with a hotel and the receipt of pick up of a 40 pounds package.

In addition, I am very disappointed as this is the MOST I have EVER spent in a hotel for fashion week, with no costumer service whatsoever.

I am planning to contact the GM about this , I was told higher management would be reached out to find a solution, no one ever called me.

The worst attitude towards a guest, and very poor hospitality management.

I think next time I will just have a drink at the rooftop, but will not stay again for business purposes.",Date of stay: October 2015,Ace Hotel Downtown Los Angeles,1,"Los Angeles, California"
Awful,"Worst food I have ever had , worst Indian ever / please do not eat here !!!!

Basmati rice tasted plastic and the daal like it was out of a frozen bag. I cannot believe who reviews this as an ""amazing Indian"" it must be people that have never eaten Indian before ?! Even if that was the case I would not go here even If I was starving z.

Really terrible , stay away",Date of visit: June 2015,Madras Indian Restaurant,1,"Oludeniz, Turkey"
