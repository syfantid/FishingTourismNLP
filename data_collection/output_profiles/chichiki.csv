The best day out imaginable!,"We had such an incredible day with captain Gerasimos fishing and swimming. It really is a must do experience if you visit Kefalonia. It is such an authentic and friendly feeling on the boat it is clear that the family have poured so much love into the trips. They have thought of everything. We had brought a big bag of bits and pieces but we probably could have just brought ourselves as there was scuba gear, inflatables etc. The children were delighted. We were greeted with a buffet style breakfast to enjoy while we set off to where the nets were. After lifting the nets we did some line fishing. We swam on a gorgeous little beach that we had all to ourselves and then ate the most delicious meal of our earlier catch. This is a trip for all ages, we took our 17 month old daughter and our 13 year old son.",Date of experience: July 2018,Poseidon Fishing Tourism Kefalonia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Relaxing friendly place,"We booked Peebles Hydro, because of what was on offer for children over Easter and we were not disappointed, the kids club is great with friendly staff and lots of activities to keep the kids occupied. Breakfast and dinner is included in your stay and it allows you to head away from the hotel to explore nearby tourist attraction and grab some lunch. We really enjoyed all the family activities, such as quick cricket, football, prize bingo etc. Yes it is a bit cheesy, but if you like to get involved it is really good fun. The fantastic child care means you can have a lovely relaxed dinner in the dining room without the little ones (which is great) or wander along to the the cocktail bar for a drink after dinner. There is a huge choice of different whiskies which my other half enjoyed sampling. The food and the service at breakfast and dinner was very prompt attentive and friendly, every member of staff we dealt with in the hotel went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. The only negative I could find was the room wasn't decorated in a modern trendy way. To be honest on a family holiday, we didn't really care. It was large, spotlessly clean and we had a t.v. and tea and coffee making facilities, we spent so little time in the room it didn't really matter that the curtains were a bit dated.",Date of stay: April 2011,Peebles Hydro,4,"Peebles, United Kingdom"
A very warm welcome in Arbroath,"A unique and special place to stay. Raymond and Esther have thought of everything, the house is gorgeous and luxurious and the service is friendly and thoughtful. They kindly recommended a restaurant for dinner and made our booking. Welcomed us back on our return where we enjoyed complimentary drinks in the lovely downstairs snug. Our room was stunning, with a walk in wardrobe a beautiful free standing bath and double size shower stocked with Arran Aromatics toiletries. Breakfast was so good, we didn't need to eat again until dinner. We are honestly at a loss to think of anything they are missing. Truly worthy of their 5 star rating.

Will be looking forward to returning..",Date of stay: October 2010,Brucefield Boutique B & B,4,"Arbroath, United Kingdom"
