"Incredible day fishing, snorkelling, eating delicious food and drinking wine","This was such a great experience. We set off at around 9am. We spent the morning net fishing, and then stopped at an island for a swim. We stopped at another two beaches in the afternoon, before eating a delicious lunch of fresh fish, salad and wine brewed by Efi and Dimitrios. It was a great opportunity to see the island, with the added benefit of the local knowledge of Efi, Dimitrios and Mohammed. We were a group of 6 friends, aged 28-30, but the experience would suit all types of groups of all ages. Efi, Dimitrious and Mohammed are fantastic. Definitely recommend this.",Date of experience: July 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
