Horrible service,"Horrible checkin experience - came 2 hours early to leave our bagage. There was no one in line. The guy frrom the desk asked us to come back two hours before departure because they could not take our bags. We came back when the checkin was opened and found 300 people standing in line for our flight and orher 3 flights so we waited in line for one hour in order to leave our bags instead of 5 minutes the first time we came.
This line was only for getting the sticker for the luggage. The bags had to be left somewhere else, where of course was another queue.

After this wonderful experience , our flight was delayed one hour without even the decency of informing passengers of the delay or cause of delay. The luggage was loaded very fast but we saw that the crew arrived one hour late.

After this one hour delay , when bording the aircraft we sadly noticed that the aircraft was filthy -> see the attached photo.

No way am I flying again with this company..",,Ryanair,1,World
Best boat trip,"We went out on a tour of the island and on a fishing trip with Captain Dimitris last summer and it made our whole trip. The Captain had a keen eye and made sure everyone had a good time. He was a wonderful host.

One of us actually did not know how to swim and was afraid to go into deep water ,but the Captain made sure that he too spent time in the water so he took us to a beach where my friend could swim as well and not be afraid of the water being too deep.

If you are in Skiathos and want to go on a boat ride to see beautiful landskapes and enjoy yourselves then I highly recommend you to contact Capitain Dimitris !",Date of experience: August 2017,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Wonderful experience,"We had a very nice time while at Dino's. The food was very tasty and the service was impecable. Our order was taken right away and the food was brought very fast.
We came here multiple times here during our stay and even served breakfast on our last day - all in all a wonderfull experience. We would definately recommend this place!",Date of visit: August 2017,Dinos,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
