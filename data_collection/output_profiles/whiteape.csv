Lobster or sausages? You decide.,"This was a fantastic trip we did with Nikos and Froso. We're dropped a net coming out of the bay and pulled it in with lobsters and lots of fish while we enjoyed the sight and had a couple of beers with feta and tomatoes on some crunchy bread. We then went for a swim while they cooked up a fantastic feast of lobsters salad and spaghetti with some local white wine. Next we did a spot of fishing from the boat with rods. Then onto the bluest water I've ever seen for a swim and snorkel. Then we had yogurt with some grape jam. Then a little siesta then back to the bay in the evening. Had some lovely chats with the folks on the boat and was made to feel very welcome. We also saw some of the other boat trips cooking sausages on the beach while we were eating our lobsters lol.

All in all the best day we've had in Greece and really finished off our stay in Milos on a high.",Date of experience: June 2018,Milos Fishing Experience,1,"Milos, Greece"
Fantastic customer service,"Great food in a fantastic setting. Food was amazing. Dim sum platter to start with followed by sliced fillet steak with spring onion and ginger and King po chicken. Couldn't finish the beef so asked for a take away. There was a misunderstanding and food got thrown out but when they realised the give me some rice with pekingese duck, pork belly, and char six pork to take home. Really nice friendly staff and they went above and beyond. Will definitely be back.",Date of visit: July 2017,Yang Sing,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Absolutely delicious,"Just got a delivery from here. Was expecting it to be pretty good as it was a higher end delivery service but it was absolutely delicious. Lamb and chicken schwarma, falafel, hommos, babaganoush. Fantastic choice when you want something a little bit different but had a very spicy Thai green curry for lunch. Mild tasty which beautiful flavours and lovely grilled meat. Highly recommend",Date of visit: March 2017,Bakchich Manchester,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Scam artists avoid at all costs,"Brought some people to this restaurant and everything was ok until we went to pay. First they tried to charge for a bottle of wine we didn't have. They didn't write anything on the bill just the price so nearly missed it. Called them out so they changed it to a glass.
Price still looked wrong so queried further. They had added on an extra 15 for no reason. Told them how much it should cost so they chsnged it.
Give them my card and saw him write in the price. He then proceeded to put on an extra 10 quid for a tip. I said what the hell are u doin. He said service charge. I said that's for me to decide not you and he pressed enter to put it through before I could take it off him. Avoid at all cost. He thought we were tourists because it was St Patrick weekend but I live on princess street and will never bring anyone here again. Terrible service",Date of visit: March 2017,Rozafa,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Fish and chips,Very good fish and chips. Even give me a few chips and curry sauce while I was waiting. Very Good size portion,Date of visit: February 2017,Portland Plaice,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Ants in the food. Very tasty,Really clever and interesting menu and helps young Cambodian people to learn the business. Came with fiance and her parents and ordered a selection of tapas. Some menu items pretty out there which I love to see like frogs legs and red ants and beautiful cocktails. Definitely worth a visit,Date of visit: November 2016,Marum,1,"Siem Reap, Cambodia"
First experience in Chennai...,"...was waiting in Sangeetha after a long 16 hr bus ride from munnar for check in time at the hostel. Had poori and a doughnut thing and my gf had an onion Dosa with two fantastic south Indian filter coffee. Made me happy. Waiter was great and very accommodating helping us out by explaining the menu and sauces.

Very good value

Thank you from the Irishman in India.",Date of visit: November 2016,Sangeetha Vegetarian Restaurant,1,"Chennai (Madras), India"
Mini tiffin was awesome,"Visited with my girlfriend and had the mini tiffin while she had poori as well as south India filter coffee, obviously. Fantastic food and attentive waiter. Really very nice and great value for money.",Date of visit: November 2016,Hotel Saravana Bhavan Restaurant,1,"Chennai (Madras), India"
Best restaurant in alleppey,Delicious food and clean and safe. Great selection and very good prices. Found it on my last night but would have eaten here for every meal if I knew about it. Awesome keep up the good work,Date of visit: November 2016,Mushroom,1,"Alappuzha, India"
A little more expensive but worth it,"You will get delicious authentic food here and honestly the best service I have received in Goa. The waiters are true professionals and extremely efficient and knowledgeable. Because the food is authentic they may warn you that a dish is spicy and this is the one place in Goa where you should heed that Warning. I ate here 3 times when in palolem. Had a lamb biryani with raita, the rolled chicken massala and finally I decided to try their hydrabadi chicken. I asked for it spicy. It was delicious but hot. Luckily the waiter took pity on me when he saw me sweating and crying lol and brought me some curd to take the edge off.

The also had some good non spicy options for my girlfriend which she really enjoyed. One thing I would say is a caipirinha really needs to be made with crushed ice but apart from that very good.",Date of visit: October 2016,Dropadi,1,"Palolem, India"
Best pizza in India,"Not really much else to say
Had pizza here three times in my week in palolem. Shockingly good. Imported salami pepperoni ham and mozzarella. Chef is an Italian nonna and the food is fantastic. Staff are nice and friendly. Do book in advance though as it's always busy but on the plus side that means food is always fresh",Date of visit: October 2016,Magic Italy Authentic Italian Restaurant Pizzeria,1,"Palolem, India"
So helpful and a great location,"Booked a budget room and for the price was perfect. Location is good and has a nice rooftop and free WiFi. What made this place stand out though is how nice and friendly and accommodating and helpful both Rocky and his dad are. We arrived at 6 in the morning on a bus and Rocky arranged a driver to collect us, he let us check in early and have a sleep. Sorted us breakfast when we got up and booked a driver to take us around for the day at a cheap price. Also sorted our bus to bangalore and let us store our bags all day and sorted out lift to the bus that night at 10pm. Really appreciated all he did and would strongly recommend Rocky Guesthouse.",Date of stay: October 2016,Rocky Guesthouse,1,"Hampi, India"
Arrogant and unprofessional owner,"The problem with this place is the management. They make u feel from the get go that they are doing you a favour letting you stay here.

I've stayed in quite a few places in goa from five star resorts in utonda to basic backpackers in vagator and a few in between and the goan people have been fantastic in all of them. Very friendly and courteous and wherever we stayed had good value for money. Obviously when your paying more you expect more but the treatment we received at ciarans was just rubbish.

The management are arrogant, rude, offensive, condescending. They blame their paying customers for their own shortcomings.

Things go wrong. That's life but it's how the problems are dealt with that makes a place good or bad. I can't understand why a manager or owner would argue with paying customers over such petty things that can be so easily fixed with understanding and sometimes just an acknowledgement.

Basically I asked to extend my stay by one extra day at 3000 rupees after already staying there for 3 nights. I asked at around 8am. The manager said no problem but when I returned after breakfast I was informed that the room was booked online and I would have to pay the difference for a Seaview room. I said I didn't want to pay any extra and why should I pay for your mistake. The owner, an older man with a ponytail intervened and said I could pay extra or leave and started blaming me for punishing them for such a small mistake.

I said it may be a small mistake on your side but for me it's a mess up for me because now I have to go and pack my stuff, move out of my room, and go out and find somewhere else to stay for the night. I said we had three good night's here already, can't we compromise and come to an agreement. I'm happy to pay 3000. He started shouting that I was swearing and punishing him and said I would have to pay the difference. Because of the way he dealt with me I argued with him quietly and asked him to see things from my point of view. That they had made a mistake and was he really going to argue with me over a few quid. He then snapped and spat out that I should Take a room for free.

So I repeated I'm happy to pay 3000.

Again he said take it for free. I don't need the money.

I felt like he was trying to make me feel like a cheap skate and was coming across very aggressive. Not one to be easily intimidated I said that I would take the room.

So basically he could have made 3000 instead of 3500. That way I would have been happy and he still would have gotten nearly the full rate for the room. Everyone wins. Instead he lost the full amount, I got a free room for a night but felt uncomfortable and didn't enjoy it. Everyone loses.",Date of stay: October 2016,Ciarans,1,"Palolem, India"
Booked for two nights stayed for 4 and will return.,"Ravi is a really good host in this secluded backpackers situated 5 mins for the beach. Very reasonable prices and great amenities. This is the first season so everything is new, new kitchen, new beds etc. So everything is physically there but the best thing is the vibe and having such an accommodating and gracious host. He organised bike rental, ordered us food and comes to the front of the rooms every evening to light incence for the mozzys and was available for travelling advice or just to chill whenever you felt like it. All in all really good. Near some great restaurants too, thalassa and antares and the mango tree for a beer.",Date of stay: October 2016,Dreams Hostel,1,"Anjuna, India"
Beautiful clean quiet beach in goa,"Fantastic beach which is also a turtle sanctuary so no buildings. Clean all the time, great for swimming and golden sand. Cleanest beach I've seen in India. Also has a fantastic little cheap fish restaurant who's name I forget set back from the beach. Lovely semolina crumbed spicy mackerel fillets.",Date of experience: October 2016,Talpona Beach,1,"Canacona, India"
Best Sunday roast in Manchester,"Was in Manchester for three weeks in may and ate here every Sunday. Best roast I've had. Loads of rich gravy, creamy buttery veg and beautiful crispy roast potatoes with extra gravy on the side. Yorkshire pudding and medium rare roast beef that melts in your mouth. Looking forward to my next trip to Manchester.",Date of visit: October 2016,The Grill on New York Street,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Lovely restaurant,"Lovely restaurant and a great view. Had just started a new menu with some new additions. Chicken tikka starter was unbeatable. Perfect spice mix and completely boneless succulent chicken thigh was beautifully tender and delicious. Followed with a rajasthan special laal maas. Spicy fiery red curry but Can be toned down for Western palate with garlic naan straight out of the oven. In India I always wait until next day before writing reviews to make sure I'm not sick so this place is good clean and safe.
The owner is one of the few restaurateurs in India who seems to genuinely wants you to have a good experience rather than just fleece you.

Highly recommend.",Date of visit: September 2016,The Curry's,1,"Jodhpur, India"
Pretty good and safe clean food. Bad timing,Nice clean restaurant but very busy with Israeli tourists when we were there. Pasta came out quick and was very nice. Pizza was quite slow because they were busy so my partner was finished before my pizza arrived. The pizza was fine but could have done with a few minutes more in the oven as it was a bit white but I guess they were rushing to get the next one in. Sort out the timings and maybe tell customers when ordering that there will be an hour wait for pizza and it would be hard to fault. Juices and drinks were very nice and the guys that work there are very nice chaps.,Date of visit: September 2016,La Pizzeria,1,"Pushkar, India"
Scrimping and saving,"Ordered a lemon juice and a lemon and mint juice, a mushroom biryani and some deal and naan.

They're not afraid to charge for the juice but you get basically a glass of water. Didn't taste like juice at all more like a half a lime squeezed in. Limes are cheap as here and the stingyness has cost u a bad review.

Playing very loosely with the word Biryani. A bowl of rice and mushroom curry. Didn't taste bad but not a biryani. Raita was extra

Dhal was ok.

Nice views from the roof and easy going with hippy decor. Special shakes on the menu and beer available...ssssh.

Maybe we ordered poorly.",Date of visit: September 2016,Nirvana cafe and pizzeria,1,"Pushkar, India"
Good budget hotel,Not bad the guys in the hotel were nice and friendly. Helped us get some beers which was easier said than done which we drank on the roof with some other backpackers. Room was fine although hot water was scarce. Food wasnt amazing but some decent restaurants nearby. Room was clean and cool with ac so if it's just somewhere to stay to see the sites this is fine. Comfy cool and clean.,Date of stay: September 2016,Hotel Amer View,1,"Amer, India"
Awesome food. Outside looks rubbish,Food here was awesome. Vege restaurant but the food is so good u forget. I was recommended this place by my driver and although dubious on first impression the food was shockingly good. Don't be put off by the guys cooking the food on the street outside it is very good. Also if you have women or kids you can seat upstairs. Only men downstairs.,Date of visit: September 2016,Khandelwal Dhaba Purana Wale,1,"Jaipur, India"
Incredible building,"Built so the moghul princesses could watch the proceedings on the street without being seen themselves, this palace is definitely worth checking out if in jaipur. We didn't go inside. They wanted 200 rupees or something to go in so we just took photos from outside.",Date of experience: September 2016,Hawa Mahal - Palace of Wind,1,"Jaipur, India"
The water palace,This palace was built by a king for his brother. Only accessible by boat but government stopped boat trips because the water was getting too polluted. Absolutely full of fish you can see them from the banks and fishing is allowed once a month.,Date of experience: September 2016,Jal Mahal,1,"Jaipur, India"
Meet the monkey man,There was a man born in the temple who grew up with the monkeys and can communicate with them and knows each monkey by name.he now works as a tour guide and commands the monkeys to carry out his will. He can make the monkeys sit on you for a photo. But actually a beautiful temple and loads of wee monkeys.,Date of experience: September 2016,Monkey Temple,1,"Jaipur, India"
Very good for the price,Obviously this hotel has taken on board the bad reviews and decided to do something about it. There were some renovations being done at the front but inside looked good. I did wander into an out of bounds area and saw new tiles and cement so they are doing a big upgrade at the minute. However this didn't disturb our stay at all. We had a suite that was very nice. Big bed A/c and really nice ornately decorated furniture. We had dinner and breakfast in the restaurant. Food was very nice for dinner. We had some traditional rajasthan food and lovely fluffy pancakes for breakfast. Staff were nice and tried their best to be helpful as possible. The check out time is a bit early which didn't affect us on this stay but that's the only thing I could fault them on.,Date of stay: September 2016,Hotel Sagar,1,"Bikaner, India"
Ornately decorated palaces and armery,"Only 300 for tourists which includes tour guide so don't be tempted by the guys outside. Tour was in hindi but the guide came to us and give us a quick English explanation about each stop on the tour. Unique in that they have a lot of weapons on display, guns, dagger, swords, bow and arrows etc. Also have a world war 1 plane inside with two stuffed leopards which they call tigers.",Date of experience: September 2016,Junagarh Fort,1,"Bikaner, India"
What a dump,"Stayed here last night. Arrived at 3am on sleeper train and was soo tired I didn't realise how bad it was. When I woke up I thought I was in hell. Thank God I slept in my clothes. Pubes all over the sheets, plaster falling off the walls, leaking water all over the floor and everywhere covered in filth. I walked upstairs to see the restaurant. Terrible and no one there. Looked I'm the kitchen, called my tour organiser and was moved to a new hotel. When leaving I was confronted by a member of staff and asked why I didn't like the room. I told him to look at it. There was around 10 guys waiting to hear my explanation maybe they should be cleaning. Here are some pics.

There",Date of stay: September 2016,Karawan Grand Casa,1,"Agra, India"
Best in Khajuraho,"Not the greatest compliment in the world but after a couple of bad experiences in Khajuraho I only ate here. Food is clean. Quite tasty, good selection and the guys are nice. Prices are reasonable and it's right across the road from the main temples. And they sell beer.",Date of visit: September 2016,Raja's Cafe,1,"Khajuraho, India"
Black ham and an ant in my pasta,"Went here with my girlfriend after reading good reviews on TA. Order a pizza and fettuccine with pesto. Pizza was OK for India. Base was too hard and it had weird black ham which we picked off and hoped for the best. Pasta came next but was a weird fluorescent green although pasta was homemade and not bad and pesto tasted ok until we found several ants in it which was when I lost my appetite. After that we only ate a raj cafe and it was fine.
Told them about the ant and asked me to pay for pasta anyway. Offered me something else free. I politely declined. Nice. Probably avoid this one. Bloody disgusting.",Date of visit: September 2016,La Bella Italia Restaurant,1,"Khajuraho, India"
Ok far from 'luxury',"Booked a luxury room after three months travelling on the cheap. Nothing that isn't easy to fix. Number one there was so much dust in the room especially on top of the fans that I kept getting things in my eyes when lying on the bed. It took me a few days to figure out what it was. I cleaned one of the fan tops myself and there was at least a years worth of dust. Never been cleaned.
Secondly after flying all night and arriving very tired, the lad who showed us the room was very difficult to get rid of. Then when I finally had to politely ask him to leave he stood with a miserable face and his hand out looking for a tip. That would have been fine if he had ever offered to carry my girlfriends backpack. But he let her carry it up three flights of stairs without even offering. I don't expect anyone to carry my bag but she was very tired and visibly struggling with the heavy bag which made me angry and after being up all night and getting ripped on the taxi from the airport he doesn't know how close he came to getting the back of my hand across his face when his hand went out for a tip.",Date of stay: September 2016,Zostel Delhi,1,"New Delhi, India"
Very impressive with intricate carvings,Nice way to spend an afternoon. Old architecture and ruins with nice gardens to relax under a tree. The tower itself is very impressive up close. A must see when in Delhi. 500ruppee for foreigners and only 30 for locals is a bit of a rip,Date of experience: September 2016,Qutub Minar,1,"New Delhi, India"
Awesome Lassi,Firstly this place only does drinks and breakfast. Secondly this is a must for your visit to Varanasi. It comes in a clay cup set inside a metal chalise and it's really good especially for foreigners to keep you bacterial balance in order. The little streets around are also good for a stroll away from the busy main streets.,Date of visit: September 2016,Bana Lassi,1,"Varanasi, India"
Morning boat trip,A good way to see the Ganges is the morning boat trip. You can see many of the ghats with people bathing and on a clear day see sunrise. You will also see the body's being cremated and the Ashes spread into the river.,Date of experience: September 2016,Ganges River,1,"Varanasi, India"
First meal in India,"Had dinner here on our first day in India. Arrived in Delhi at 9.45 and our dinner here at six was first thing we had eaten since the night before in Colombo. Had been sleeping most of the day and wanted a breakfast/lunch/dinner type meal...also was pretty shook from the long flight so wasn't feeling too adventurous. This place was clean, had good service, good food and reasonably priced. Around 825 for two meals and two drinks. Biryani was pretty good and served with raita. Herself had butter chicken and garlic naan. Really nice. Will probably eat here again.",Date of visit: September 2016,The Indian Grill,1,"New Delhi, India"
Brilliant dive centre,I completed my open water here over the last couple of days. My instructor was Mandy and was with just two other divers also doin their open water. Very informative and knowledgeable and because it was a small group we all got plenty of attention if we needed it. Always felt safe during the dives and feel that I was thoroughly trained in the skills whilst remaining a lot of fun. Great experience and I would highly recommend to anyone beginning diving. My girlfriend has an advanced ticket and did some fun dives and she really enjoyed it too. Great bunch of people and thanks again.,Date of experience: September 2016,AquaCreed Scuba Dive Centre,1,"Nilaveli, Sri Lanka"
Tried to rob us with made up charges.,"Just had dinner here. Food was OK but we ordered two drinks from the cocktail menu. A Singapore sling at 750rp and a berry caipirihna at 700.our bill for the food was 6600 and then an older waiter came and told us the drinks are separate and will cost 2300. I paid and then thought about it and asked for the bill. The prices of the drinks were 925 and 950 each plus service charge plus tax. I asked to see the cocktail menu again and was given a different menu with prices much higher. 825 and 850 but still less than the prices charged. I argued that this was a different menu and the Waiter laughed in my face telling me I was mistaken and there is only one menu.

I asked the barman who served me where is the other menu and he went and checked and produced the original menu
Manager was called and refund issued...kind of. He give us one drink complementary and charged 925 plus service plus tax for the other. Whatever
Rubbish. Ruined the meal. Only honest person was the young barman. We're backpacking and decided to treat ourselves after eating cheap for the last month but as soon as they saw white people they thought victim and tried to fleece us. No good. Careful who you sell your franchise to.",Date of visit: August 2016,TGI Friday's,1,"Colombo, Sri Lanka"
Great place,"We stayed here for two nights. Free breakfast every morning and a dinner cooked every night. They have tents and bungalows. We stayed in the tents. Really comfy spring mattresses as opposed to those rubbish foam ones I've become accustomed to in Sri Lanka. Power points in the rooms. Mosquito repel provided in a plug in. Nice warm pool with slack rope across it. Large high ceiling chill out area with pool table and darts and a fridge and free chilled water cooler with bottled water.

So the things there are pretty nice but the atmosphere is really cool and that's the main thing about it. As soon as you arrive the lads make you feel very welcome and try to get to u involved in activities with them and the other guests. We did a surf lesson and Yoga and ate with the local family down the road at their house and went to a bit of a party with the lads friends. The only problem was we only stayed two nights. I think 5-10 days would of been a lot better to get the full benefit of the Camp.

Well done lads keep up the good work.",Date of stay: August 2016,Camp Poe,1,"Ahangama, Sri Lanka"
Content to be terrible,"The first thing you will notice is the arrogant attitude of the greeter. Impolite uninterested and lazy. Five of us were crammed around a table for 4 so we had to all tuck in our arms on one side. My brother and I are 6'2 and 6' and so my wee girlfriend was hanging off the edge of the table.

It took about 25 mins before our drinks order was taken although I asked at least 3 times politely if we could order from different staff.

If one or two things were bad I would let them slide if the rest was good but it wasn't the case.

The glasses were hot out of the washer. We weren't offered ice. I asked for ice and was fobbed off so just poured it onto a hot glass. I ordered gnocchi with sage butter and panchetta. It was gnocchi with butter and bacon. I asked wherr was the sage. A friend was called...he didn't know what sage was either.he went to find out. Came back 15 minutes layer when everyone else was nearly done with 2 sage leaves I'm his hand. He said u want this and dropped them on the table. It was rubbish, overpriced no-one knew what was goin on.

The staff were standing around yawning. Just a tourist trap. Unauthentice take ur money and run. U probably won't be back next week anyway. Lazy cooking. Just very bad",Date of visit: September 2015,Nosolo Italia,1,"Vilamoura, Portugal"
Great wraps,Had the spicy chicken two days ago and two tandoori wraps tonight. Really tasty and very good price. Guys are very friendly and they have cold drinks now too. Need to go back and try the buster burger,Date of visit: August 2016,Licensed to Grill,1,"Kandy, Sri Lanka"
Great place with great people,Planned to stay here two days but stayed and will stay again next week when I'm back in Kandy. Nice clean rooms. Great price. All normal beds so don't have to worry about top bunks. Great place for backpackers. Very friendly and nice people. Always around to have a chat or give advice on the 'chill out' balcony and invited us out with his mates for a bit of a session which ended up being pretty wild. All in all had a great stay here and would strongly recommend if staying in Kandy. Great for party people but could also be good for relaxing stay.,Date of stay: August 2016,Hostel 107,1,"Kandy, Sri Lanka"
Great tour with Randy Box (Salinda),"Really enjoyable evening and a great way to see Colombo fast. Was picked up at 4 and given King coconuts and a flower necklace for the misses. Went to a beautiful Hindu temple, floating markets, tea tasting, buddest temple, Dutch hospital and stopped for some tasty hoppers some government buildings then stopped for some chicken, curry daal and very delicious roti. Onto the independence memorial and finished off with some bbq at big bite restaurant. Nice to see locals in local restaurants. we give flowers to Buddha and watered the bow tree in the buddist temple. Salinda the driver was very knowledgeable and the cooler was full of beer and cold water.

The tuctuc has a speaker system and phone chargers too so you can blast out some lit beats and looks very different to other tuctucs in Sri Lanka with its blue and white paint job and convertible roof so the locals all want to check it out.

Definitely lots of fun and worth doing if your in Colombo.",Date of experience: July 2016,Tuk Tuk Safari Sri Lanka,1,"Colombo, Sri Lanka"
Please save your money-total rubbish,"Was supposed to be picked up at half three so sat in Arabian courtyard hotel lobby for over an hour waiting when the driver showed up after 4.30.

We were ushered to the 4x4 without a word from the driver who, apart from very brief and sometimes extremely vague instruction, didn't speak to anyone for the duration.

We were brought to a quad biking place that no one had mentioned? Driver told us, 'back in 30 minutes' and disappeared.

The quad biking was chaos, hundreds of tourists scrambling for a few bikes, so we decided to pass and get a drink for which we paid ten times the price printed on the 7up can.

Eventually driver returned and we went dune bashing which was quite good.

Drove close to camp and swapped drivers.

Arrived at the camp and was told to get out and given some brief ineligible instruction before the driver sped off.

Got on a very depressed and skinny looking camel for 45 seconds.

Went inside-no coffee or tea or dates.
No shisha unless you paid.
One soft drink.
Disinterested henna person.
Rounded up for a starter which was handed out by some grumpy chap and was pretty crap and cold.

Belly dancing was good.
Fire dancing was good.
Man in dress dancing was good.

No sandboarding that I or anyone else could see.

Food was OK. Buffet. Meat handed out, literally, some guy dug his hand into a bucket and plonked a kebab and a chicken leg on your plate. Service with a scowl.

Avoid it's rubbish and for a short stay will leave a bad taste in your mouth.",Date of experience: July 2016,Desert Safari Dubai,1,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
Fantastic and truly authentic,"Came here for a cheat meal after a week of hard gyming and healthy eating. Fantastic. Had the antipasti for starter and misses had the arancini
Both delicious and beautifully presented and followed by incredible pizza. Proper napoli style. Really excellent quality and very reasonable prices. Friendly attentive waiters that make you feel at home.

Great Chinese,Came here for Lunch with my girlfriend. Doesn't look like much from outside or inside but it is really fantastic food. Always full of Chinese people so that says a lot. Started with dim sum and soup and ribs and had a chicken dish for main. Will be a bit packed especially for lunch but delicious and an experience.,Date of visit: January 2016,Happy Seasons,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Boozy Lunch,"This is the first place we ate in once we arrived in Bergerac. We had been on the go since 4.40am and skipped breakfast so after a short walk from our b&b we arrived at La Flambee.

our hostess recommended it for a delicious traditional French lunch and we were very impressed.
On arrival at the converted farmhouse you will see goats and pigs and some other animals running around at the back but once inside it is a very nicely decorated restaurants. Our servers were very friendly and courteous and made us feel very comfortable, even complimenting me on my led zeppelin t-shirt and having a quick chat about rock and roll.

Ordered a delicious local wine recommended by the waiter that was very reasonably priced.
Had a black ham and artichoke salad for start and rack of lamb fire main and my girl had confit duck leg.

Both were fantastic and beautifully prepared and presented and the bill came in pretty cheap too.",Date of stay: May 2016,La Flambee,1,"Bergerac City, France"
