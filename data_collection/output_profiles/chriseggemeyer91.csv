Amazing Hotel With Amazing Staff!,"The Hotel speaks for itself -- it's situated in one of the most beautiful places on the island, with stunning views of the sunset and easy access to fantastic fixtures of Oia. The rooms are fantastic, with more amenities than I'm used to, and prompt service.

The real difference here: Elias. Elias is the hotel manager extraordinaire. The other reviews on here likely wax poetic about him as well, but I can't tell you the impact that he had on our trip. Not only did he arrange transit, but really shaped our entire time in Santorini, helping us pick out AMAZING meals (Ammoudi Fish Tavern and Red Bicycle), pointing us to good hiking, arranging a fantastic local tour, and following up on any issues we had almost immediately, no matter the time of day.

The hotel is expensive, but I guarantee you, it is entirely worth it.",Date of stay: June 2018,Art Maisons Luxury Santorini Hotels Aspaki & Oia Castle,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Best Fish Of My Life,"For starters, the crew are three of the nicest people in the world: Anthi, the captain, is extremely knowledgeable and engaging, and Marcos and Muhammad were very nice to us, going so far as to let us be involved (to the extent that wrangling run-away Octopus is involved) in the process of hauling in most of the catch.

After hauling in pots and net, Anthi and the crew will take you to a beautiful bay that makes for good swimming, and fantastic hand-line fishing -- we caught 6 fish among 3 people!

Most importantly, though, the food -- I can say with complete confidence that this was the best seafood that I've ever had in my life, bar none. Not only did we have the opportunity to try fish that we had never even heard of, much less had available to us in the US, but it was all prepared simply. I like to tell my wife that, when we came to Greece, it was my duty to find the best charred Octopus (one of my favorite foods). We ate at some incredible restaurants, but this blew them all out of the water.

When the time comes for us to return to Santorini, we will absolutely go again.",Date of experience: June 2018,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Fantastic Prix Fixe Restaurant,"WARNING: THIS IS A PRIX FIXE RESTAURANT. A lot of people seem to have missed the message and are disappointed to find out that it's 8 courses with small portions.

That out of the way, Red Bicycle was the best meal that my wife and I had on our honeymoon, and that's saying a lot. The meal is expensive, but what you get for it is a wonderful spin on several traditional Greek dishes. If you're looking for a typical Greek salad or gyro or something like that, then you've come to the wrong place. If you're willing to trust the chef, though, you're in for a treat. The service was superb, the food was phenomenal, and you can't beat the location. If we have the good fortune to return to Santorini, we will absolutely be back.",Date of visit: June 2018,Red Bicycle,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Best Way To See Mykonos,"I can't thank Panos enough for the wonderful day. This was my honeymoon surprise for my wife, and it turned into one of our favorite days of the trip. Panos was a fantastic host, taking us to some incredible places, including Delos, cooking a fantastic meal, finding us a secluded place to swim and enjoy the water, and finally taking us to the best spot to enjoy the sunset on the island. It's not a cheap trip, but it is worth every penny. Thank you Panos!",Date of experience: June 2018,Mykonos Paradise Cruises,4,"Mykonos, Greece"
