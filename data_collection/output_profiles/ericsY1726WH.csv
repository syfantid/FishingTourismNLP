Awesome Day Trip,We had a fairly large group of 11 and deliberated which boat trip we wanted to take around Milos for my father's birthday. This one was perfect! Tina and her dad made us feel like family as they took us fishing and to Kleftiko bay for snorkeling and lunch. I'd highly recommend to anyone looking for an authentic mom-and-pop island experience.,Date of experience: July 2018,Milos Fishing Trip,5,"Milos, Greece"
Great birthday idea,"I booked a morning flight for my girlfriend's birthday and man what a treat. Logan, Tina, and crew handled the whole operation smoothly and professionally. The great weather and quiet flying made for an awesome experience and perfect gift idea.",Date of experience: September 2016,Middle Tennessee Hot Air Adventures,5,"Franklin, Tennessee"
