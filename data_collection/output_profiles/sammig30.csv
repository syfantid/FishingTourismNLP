Can't fault it....,"Visited this pub prior to them being taken over and was not impressed. Well... I cannot fault the way this lovely pub has been turned around. What absolutely friendly, welcoming staff. Reasonably priced and food amazing. Went for Sunday roast today and it was absolutely fantastic. Booked for next week right away. Would recommend without hesitation.",Date of visit: October 2020,The Old Red Lion,1,"Staines, United Kingdom"
Couldn't leave without visiting...,"Myself and my friend have been planning a visit to this little pub for sometime, we finally made it. After finding it very easily from the station, we unfortunately made the mistake of not checking the opening times and realised we would not be able to go until the following day. Luckily having an overnight stay booked, we could come back. Which we did. Knowing the pub landlord would be quite surprised when he saw us made it all the more special. All beers and ciders are local as is the wine. A very small, quaint place just away from the seafront, lovely.",Date of experience: October 2020,Anchored Micro Pub,1,"Worthing, United Kingdom"
Lovely clean pub with fantastic friendly service,Stopped by here for a couple of days running. QR code displayed clearly and temperature taken at the door. Tables all well spaced. Staff all very friendly and we were made to feel like one of the locals. Had lunch on the second visit and it was brilliant. Portions very good and at great prices too. A must when we visit Worthing again.,Date of visit: October 2020,The Hare and Hounds,1,"Worthing, United Kingdom"
"Excellent and friendly service, food amazing","After trying to find a steakhouse open in Worthing, decided upon here instead. So glad we did as the restaurant was fantastic. Friendly greeting on arrival, made to feel so welcome, like friends. Served immediately for drinks and once food was ordered it came out promptly. I had the tagliatelle with fillet steak, amazing dish. My friend had the calzone. Really lovely and will definitely return when back in Worthing.",Date of visit: October 2020,Enzos Italian Restaurant,1,"Worthing, United Kingdom"
Asset to Staines,"First time visiting this restaurant and what a treat. Smiling, friendly staff welcomed us in. Hadn't booked but were accommodated with a window table. Immediately given olives, flatbread and a dip similar to tzatziki. A Turkish version. Very tasty. It took a while to be asked about drinks and food but once ordered was promptly brought out. I had a dish called Ali Nazik which was a choice of lamb or chicken. I chose lamb and it was amazing. Flavours were delicious. Would highly recommend a visit. I will definitely be going back.",Date of visit: July 2020,Fora,1,"Staines, United Kingdom"
Disappointed,"Came here on a week night to try and see how they are coping with the new rules. Started brilliantly with a chap on the door giving forms for track and trace and showing us to a table. Ordered drinks at the bar and food via the app. However as the night moved on, noticed more customers coming in without being signed in due to the member of staff having to help with food when he should have been on the door but also many younger customers going in and out of the wrong doors. It sounds petty but rules are rules. It is for everyone's safety. Put me off.",Date of visit: July 2020,The George,1,"Staines, United Kingdom"
Poor organisation and cleanliness,"Considering the current circumstances, I recently visited this pub thinking that their adequate outside space would make a good venue. On arrival, on a week night I was advised by the sign outside to find a table, order my drinks and they be would be served at a separate table for me to collect. Oh not during the week it seems. Customers are 'allowed' to order and collect from the bar. Ok. When waiting for my turn I could smell the stale beer eminating from the bar area. Probably the immense amount of dirty glasses on the bar which is no fault of the bar man, he had no help whatsoever. It made me want to turn around and not bother. Instead I did purchase a drink, needless to say I'm so glad I didn't order food, which turned out to be not on offer anyway even though there is a huge food on offer board outside. The system for crossing paths with other guests while they go to the toilet is laughable. The clientele are far from well mannered and language disgusting when I would consider this a family pub.",Date of visit: July 2020,The Pelican,1,"Addlestone, United Kingdom"
Quiet and chilled,Stayed 8th December for 5 days. Could have easily stayed longer. The location of our bungalow was perfect as usual with good distance between pool and to the exit gates. I know some people moan about the dated furniture or decor in the bungalows but this can be overlooked when you spend a maximum of an hour inside. Beds are comfortable enough and though we did not have a towel change during the 5 days it wasn't too much of a problem. Love the walk down into town or slight shortcut to the beach and walkway which brought us out just opposite the island bar and restaurant. Went self catering as the supermarket is so close. Stocked up beers and crisps. Though bars close by provided a break from the sun. Will be going back next year for sure.,Date of stay: December 2019,Bungalows Castillo Club Lake,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Relaxing & happy holiday,"This was my 4th visit to this hotel and again it was brilliant. From the moment I arrived with my friend, the staff were so welcoming and recognised us from last year which makes you feel great. They work so hard to make sure everyone is served within good time at the bars around the hotel. Though I have to say the bar at the infinity pool is a little too small and is packed, making it difficult to get a drink but this is not the staffs fault. This is my least favourite area of the hotel.
I had asked for a room which I had been given before and normally they can honour this, however at reception we were told you have been upgraded and there is still a sea view. I can assure you, the room we had was no upgrade and a lot smaller than we had last year, a little disappointed actually. Sea view if you strained your neck to see it. However, did not complain as we do not stay in the room for very long when away.
Food was very good. Ate at the African restaurant everyday apart from one night where we booked the Asian which was lovely.
We had fab weather which obviously makes it all the more amazing, will look to book next year but not yet sure.",Date of stay: November 2019,Hotel Riu Touareg,1,"Boa Vista, Cape Verde"
Excellent food and service,Had pizza to share along with the most gorgeous garlic bread ever! Service was fantastic so went again for my birthday meal. Steaks all round. Cava blush. Steaks cooked to perfection and how we requested. Service again was fantastic and would definitely go back.,Date of visit: October 2019,Tivoli Terrace,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Slap dash,Booked this lounge as it was reasonably priced and when travelling alone it's easier to get a table and have food etc. On my arrival it was quite clear that it had been busy but nearly all tables were full with glasses and plates. This is very off putting. The hot food was lacking and I had to ask if they were filling it up again. They did but dish by dish allowing the first things chosen to go cold. It was early in the morning but I did have a couple of glasses of their Rosé wine which was very nice. This lounge does not feel clean. The toilets are fine though. I can only compare this to the north terminal and that is looked after better. Next time I will book the aspire lounge.,Date of experience: September 2019,My Lounge South Terminal,1,"Crawley, United Kingdom"
A welcome beer,Just recently visited again to this lovely bar. I had walked down from Cala Ferrera and it was boiling hot. Had a couple of very welcome cold beers sitting in the sunshine looking at the gorgeous view. The lovely harbour. Wonderful location. I'll be returning.,Date of experience: September 2019,Jolly Roger,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Excellent,Enjoyed a fantastic meal here. Friendly staff. Reasonable in price and good quality. My king prawn madras was absolutely delicious.,Date of visit: September 2019,Spice of India,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Excellent,Have been here before and enjoyed my meal and service so I went again. Once again food and service was superb.,Date of visit: September 2019,Steakhouse Rancho El Patio,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Disappointed with my room given,"Just returned from this hotel after 4 nights stay. Before my arrival I had requested if possible a high floor. Upon arrival this was not mentioned at all and I was allocated a 1st floor room. I would not have minded so much except this was on the side of the building where the refuse lorry comes in each morning, sometimes as early as 5.15am. I know they have to do their job and get round to a lot of hotels but this is very annoying and loud. I did not sleep at all well once woken. I have to say that the staff are an asset to the place, special mention to Simone who works all hours. Maria on pool bar, always smiling and very polite and Juan who is also very polite and help. Of course Luis. Food is plentiful and drinks good. I opted to upgrade to all inclusive purely for the drinks. I ate out 3 out of 4 nights. All in all a lovely break and I will return.",Date of stay: September 2019,Hotel Cala Ferrera,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Too much,Do not eat all day if you are going to have any of the large steaks on offer. My friend had the T bone and I had the ribeye. Both were cooked to perfection but were absolutely huge. Gorgeous but too much.,Date of visit: May 2019,Fado Rock Steak House,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
A week of bliss,"Stayed here for a week in May and will be returning in December. Would come again between if I had the chance. Allocated a bungalow within the lake part of the resort this time. Room 101. It was fantastic. Quiet, newly renovated with new kitchen and bathroom. Short walk to very clean pool. Noticed this being cleaned every day and area swept by lifeguard. It was very quiet in the whole resort but as far as this place goes, value for money and self catering option was fantastic. Can't wait to return on December 7th.",Date of stay: May 2019,Castillo Beach Bungalows,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Quiet times,"I do like this bar, a lot. However, it was very quiet for the time of year which was disappointing. Not through fault of their own. Arrived on a Saturday night to find it closed. Visited during the day including listening to their live music acts which were very good. Cheese & onion baguette delicious. Young Welsh waitress very sweet and helpful.
Towards the end of our week, have to say, the beer was pouring very flat with a slight twang which was a put off as this is what drove us away last time. However, will still return and hopefully see everyone in December.",Date of visit: May 2019,View Bar & Restaurant,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Disappointed,"This was our second visit to this restaurant and went in with high hopes as the first visit had been excellent last time we were over. Couldn't have been more different. My lamb madras was so hot, it burnt my mouth and lips, which I know it is a hot curry but this should not happen. My friend ordered an adult version of a kids meal and they said no problem. They brought out a small plate of 4 nuggets and chips, when challenged, they brought another small plate with the same on it.
Service was poor and we did notice that once the manager had left, he was very welcoming, the other staff just mucked around and it made for a disappointing evening. probably won't go back.",Date of visit: May 2019,Bollywood SPICES,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
First time and will return,Just had drinks here but was a fantastic atmosphere. Singing was absolutely out of this world. Drinks not expensive either.,Date of visit: May 2019,The Kings,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
First time and will return,"First time tried and it was excellent. Meal was delicious and service fantastic. Asked if my friend could have an adult version of a kids meal, done without any fuss. Brilliant.",Date of visit: May 2019,Aromas Curries And Wines,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Bit more updated,"Arrived 8th May at the usual reception but was told to pop down to the other reception which was this one for Lake. First of all the lady, Sandra that we dealt with was ultra helpful and friendly. Found our bungalow which was a little far from the pool but adequate and quiet at night. Asked for extra pillows which we had to pay 3 euros for but this was fine and made the nights sleep even better.
Stayed self catering which was fine for us as we like to eat & drink out through our week. The pool area was kept very clean and the pool was being cleaned every day. The sunbeds are new and comfy.
All in all, a fantastic week and we will stay again for sure.",Date of stay: May 2019,Bungalows Castillo Club Lake,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
An excellent recommendation,"Recommended this place by the local social club following attending a christening party. Booked a table as we were told it gets packed. Arrived to find it empty. Felt very welcome by the staff, a gorgeous open fire burning and the restaurant to ourselves. There were 6 of us and all had dinner including starters. All food was delicious and waiting staff were lovely to deal with. Drinks flowed. If ever in the area again, will definitely visit.",Date of visit: January 2019,The Plum Pudding,1,"Milton, United Kingdom"
Up in estimations,"I never thought I would be writing a review on this pub to say how much I enjoy eating and drinking in here. Food is so great for value with a lot of choices coming with a free drink. On a diet, there are low calorie choices too. Staff can sometimes ignore you when they are chatting but majority very attentive. Young manager, I believe James, does a fantastic job. I would even go in there on my own and I am female.",Date of visit: February 2019,The George,1,"Staines, United Kingdom"
"Eating, quiz, drinking and socialising","Been here a few times now. Eaten three times. First visit had curry on recommendation but I didn't like the taste very much. Second time eating had lamb shoulder, unfortunately I was given the joint rather than the blade and it put me off a bit. The third time I had steak, fillet with a brandy and horseradish sauce oh my goodness, it was delicious. One of the best steaks I have ever had. Served with sauté potatoes and vegetables, so nice. Very welcomed by staff and locals alike. Very enjoyable pub to visit.",Date of visit: January 2019,The Harrow Inn,1,"Shepperton, United Kingdom"
A let down,"Chosen for the Sunday lunch on a friend's recommendation. Booked a table as this was recommended. Greeted by a female bar person who I can only describe as a face like a slapped backside. The owner however seemed very friendly. Took our seat which I felt very claustrophobic in as I was so close to the person behind me. Went to the bar to order. Chose whitebait to share for starters and gammon as there was no beef, my friend had pork. Whitebait was over fried but tasty. The gammon was of measly proportions. Served with red cabbage, not a great choice. Roast potatoes were quite nice. My friend said the pork was nice. The tiniest bit of crackling, not worth putting on the plate to be honest. Not once asked if we wanted any extra sauces or gravy. I asked for horseradish as I like it with everything. What came out was NOT horseradish, more like tartare sauce. Horrible. We moved to the bar area to finish our drinks where the miserable bar person asked was everything OK in the most uncaring tone possible, to which I replied, it was erm alright. Will not be going back to eat. Not a nice experience at all.",Date of visit: February 2019,The Old Red Lion,1,"Staines, United Kingdom"
Tried for a second time,"Following my visit in May, I decided to try this place again on my September trip. I have to say, what a vast improvement. Ordered a couple of beers to start and rather than in large jug type glasses they were in straight Amstel glasses, this made the beer much more fizzy and colder for longer, lovely.
Visited in the afternoon for the singer and she was fantastic. Had such a good laugh. Didn't try the food but the place seemed much more popular this time around. New management have taken over and I think they are doing a great job. Booked to go back in May 19, so will definitely be going back to The View.",Date of visit: September 2018,View Bar & Restaurant,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
"Can't fault it, will be back again","This hotel is not a 5 star, as other people have said but the service you get within the hotel is fantastic. This was my 3rd time and I have booked already for next year. I had asked for the same room as last year, on arrival they apologised they could not give me that room but did have the one above, in the same block. This room for view was even better. The rooms are of an African theme with the colour scheme but are very comfortable and they provide 6 bottles of water in your fridge for your stay and will top up if needed. Yes, the toilet does smell a little but this is due to it being salt water. Keep the door closed and lid down, maybe a little courtesy spray and its fine.
Our balcony looked out over the beach and sea which is very therapeutic to watch, on some days the waves were really high. Wonderful to watch.
We stuck to the main pool area, near to the bar but did move on a couple of days to get away from the loud guys at the bar who sat drinking all day. They soon calmed down so it didn't ruin the holiday by any means. Weather was fantastic and very hot some days.
Food in the main buffet restaurant is plentiful but as you do not need to book the African restaurant, we ate there most nights and used it for breakfast as well. Drinks are plentiful and keep coming. A lot of the staff recognised us from previous visits and topped up our drinks without the need to prompt. Felt very welcome at each bar visited within the hotel grounds. Booked for next year as mentioned at the same time of year as the weather is brilliant and its a late getaway.",Date of stay: November 2018,Hotel Riu Touareg,1,"Boa Vista, Cape Verde"
Same old act,Been to Pieros quite a few times now and went this time in the hope the usually brilliant Diva Chanel had changed the act a little. It was disappointing to walk in and realise it was the same as all previous years.,Date of experience: September 2018,Pieros Music Cafe,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
It's ideal for what we wanted,"Stayed for 3 days this time. The bungalow we had was fine. A front door, a balcony at the back and plenty of room in the bedroom and lounge. I still feel that self catering is the best option though the restaurant was full most mornings, this may mean they are trying to do better. Will go back.",Date of stay: September 2018,Castillo Beach Bungalows,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Good ragu pizza,Very much enjoyed a ragu pizza and a couple of cold beers in this place. Will definitely go again. Great for watching people too.,Date of visit: September 2018,The Goose & Firkin,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
What a let down,"This restaurant is always a must when going to Caleta however this time it was so disappointing. Service was so slow, no smile at all from any of the staff and as for the food, actually disgusting. I chose beef fajitas which I normally love but this time they were dry. Did not come out sizzling and had tiny pieces of beef mixed with chopped up tomatoes. My idea of fajitas is the meat, onions and peppers. I questioned the tomatoes to which they answered, they are peppers, I think I do know the difference! My friend had pork chops. Well they may as well not bothered, they were so thin and dry. I can honestly say I will not be going there again.",Date of visit: September 2018,Wild West Steak House,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
One of the best curries,"Visited here for the first time on this holiday, so glad we did. I had the chicken madras and it was one of the best I have ever had. My friend doesn't do curry so had something from the alternative menu and the portion size was amazing. Service was really good and price not too bad either. Will definitely go again when I'm back next year.",Date of visit: September 2018,Bollywood SPICES,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Good service but late,"I would use this airline again however, they were late both ends of my journey. This is not always the airlines fault but it is a little annoying nonetheless. Service on board was very good indeed.",Date of travel: September 2018,Enter Air,1,World
Fabulous day at sea,"I am so glad I chose this trip over a normal sunbed filled, packed to the rafters boat trip. Antonia is the loveliest host and greeted me like we had met before. I felt so at ease straight away. The group of people we had on board were so nice and considering language was not easy. This was because I don't speak Russian or Italian, nor Greek for that matter but we all seemed to try and converse. Watching the nets get brought in by hand and all the fishes plus an octopus was so cool and interesting. Watching Mihales tenderize the octopus was fun, beating the life out of it basically but then when eaten was fantastic. The lunch that was prepared for us considering the limited facilities was amazing. The wine was very sweet and lovely to drink. I will definitely do this trip again because I know each time will be different. Thank you to you all, Antonia, Mihales and Hassan. Loved it. Samantha xx",Date of experience: September 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic,"Loved this place, visited more than once during my stay and would eat there every night on my next visit. Service and greeting fantastic and food wonderful.",Date of visit: September 2018,Acropolis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Service very slow,This restaurant is quite big but was not all that busy when I visited. Service too slow for me. Food was actually very good. But trying to pay the bill proved a long wait and frustrating. Had to walk over to the till area to do so. Pity as view is fantastic.,Date of visit: September 2018,Koutoupas Paradise,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Too much of a hurry,"This restaurant I had read good reviews about. What a pity. Service was slow, food was not very good and the waiter was in such a hurry to get around the tables he knocked wine all over my table. Did not and would not go back.",Date of visit: September 2018,Dum Spiros Spero Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Not great,Visited once as I found the service very slow. Food was fine but nothing special. It was the cheaper of the restaurants I tried but certainly was not the best.,Date of visit: September 2018,O Milos,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Relaxing time,"First time visiting the island and the apartments. The instant I arrived I felt very welcome and it stayed that way all week.
The apartments are quite remote and on my first evening I did wonder how far I would have to walk to the nearest restaurant. It wasn't too bad, and I always had a couple of drinks at the bar where Erato is very nicely smiling and happy to serve. During the day I lazed by the pool and never felt hassled to eat there or drink. Barbara cook's all the food on fairly limited facilities but everything I had was lovely.
The pool is well kept as are the grounds and my room was fantastic. My kindle decided to break too so I was so pleased to have a small bookshelf outside my room to choose from. All in all I had a fantastic relaxing stay and I will be going back.",Date of stay: September 2018,Barbara Studios & Apartments,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Disgusting cocktails,"Decided to pop in here for a drink and a bit of cheesy Elvis. Wish we never had. The cocktails were disgusting, not sure there was any alcohol in them and the pina colada was like watery milk from a carton. Foul. As for the Elvis, I have seen some awful acts in my time but he was dire. Looked nothing like the big man and as for singing, I cannot comment. An awful decision made to go in here, would never go in again.",Date of experience: June 2018,Eden Paradise,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Enjoyable afternoon,"Took my sister here for the first time at the weekend for her birthday drinks. Firstly, the location is fantastic and we managed to get a table right at the front over looking the marina. The lady serving us recommended a large bottle of prosecco as it would be cheaper than four small bottles. It was a good recommendation. We sat and drank our bubbles whilst looking at the gorgeous boats, chatting and laughing. Cannot wait to go back later in the year.",Date of experience: June 2018,Jolly Roger,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Improved service & decor,"Just arrived back from a short stay at this hotel. I have stayed here before maybe two years ago and they have definitely improved their service but have also updated some areas of the hotel and the quality of the food in the restaurant is also better too. From reception to the pool bar, I could not fault the friendliness of the staff. The young lady in the pool bar had a smile every day and it made such a difference from the miserable chap that worked there when I went last time. I must also say, for a hotel, the prices of the drinks is very reasonable, I just wish the bar was open a little later. Location is good and not too far even to the marina which was an enjoyable walk. All in all, an excellent few days and I look forward to coming back again.",Date of stay: June 2018,Hotel Cala Ferrera,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Food & service excellent,"Only visited here once during my stay but I would definitely go again. Firstly, the staff are lovely. Friendly and helpful. Only had nachos and some wine but the nachos were delicious. We could have easily had more. Reasonable in price too and great location for watching people. Definitely worth a visit while in Cala D'Or.",Date of visit: June 2018,Steakhouse Rancho El Patio,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Early season,"I have just arrived back from staying here again. After a long journey over, I arrived at 12 midnight but was greeted by the new night watchman. I grabbed a bottle of water and went to bed. Woke up feeling refreshed after a good sleep and went down for breakfast where Mama greeted me like an old friend. It felt nice being back. Had a lovely breakfast of eggs on toast, everything on the menu is cooked to order and good value.
The pool area is lovely, clean and the pool is well maintained. First couple of days I realised I was the only customer. Little did I know I would have the place to myself all week. What can I say. The food I had was very good. The few beers I had were cold. It is close to both the Old Village and town. You can walk the dry canal way into town or the main road whichever you wish. Had the best, relaxing time and now want to book for my birthday week!",Date of stay: May 2018,ICR Sun Village Apartments,1,"Icmeler, Turkey"
One of the best I have flown with,"First time of flying with this airline but I have to say, I not only would do it again and again, I would recommend it to anyone. Staff are friendly and proficient but also the service they provide with 23kg luggage, a meal on both legs of my journey, a free bottle of wine on longer part of the journey, water, tea or coffee at all other times. All in all and excellent service, very enjoyable.",Date of travel: May 2018,Turkish Airlines,1,World
"Self catering, best option","Just returned from a 4 day break at this complex. I did say after my first experience that I would not return. However, it was a cheap deal on a self catering basis and suited mine and my friends needs this time.
The bungalow we were given was just inside the Park complex and it was nice enough. The beds were actually very comfy and I slept well. The complex that side was very quiet and very peaceful during the daytime and also during the night. They have renovated the pool are from when I was there last time and it looked really inviting, however, way too cold. It was unfortunate that it was cloudy during our stay this time.
Reception staff were friendly on arrival and though our bungalow was not ready for an hour, we went for a walk and returned so not a problem. I had to inform them also that we were leaving a day early due to flights and again, very helpful with regards to transfer times etc. After this stay, i think I would go again and request Park based on this stay.",Date of stay: May 2018,Castillo Beach Bungalows,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Flat beer,"You cannot beat the view from this place. It does exactly what it says in the name 'view'. But have to say, we were the only people in there and the large beers were flat. I would go back for the view though and just drink something else.",Date of visit: May 2018,View Bar & Restaurant,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Service slow to start,"This restaurant is very good value and the food is excellent but you do have to wait for the service to start. We were seated quickly but waited to be served even for drinks. Once you get your drinks and have ordered, it comes in good time. The waiters don't look very happy and to be fair, I think they were short staffed when we visited this time. Worth a visit for sure.",Date of visit: May 2018,Wild West Steak House,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Just as lovely as the first time,"This was the second time I had visited this hotel. First time with friends but this time alone. It was so nice to see familiar faces behind the bar and when they also recognized me from the time before, that was lovely. They must see so many people.
Check in was quick and friendly, they even gave me the same room I had last year too which I did request but I couldn't remember the exact number so for them to do this was wonderful. I instantly felt at home.
Bar service and staff are fantastic. I did see people huffing and puffing because they had to wait at least 1 minute to be served. They should relax a little. You would wait longer in a pub!
Food was also brilliant. So much to choose from and sometimes I did have some strange combinations on my plate as there was so much choice. A little of this, a little of that. Lots of fish and plenty of lovely salad on offer.
Yes, the pool is a little tired with some of the tiles missing but nothing that is going to affect you swimming or relaxing by the pool. The guys were working all day to replace some of the small mosaic tiles around the edge. However they would have to drain the pool to do some of the others. Considering this is an all year round resort, I am not sure when they would have time to do this?
The beach is gorgeous and I took the time to walk along it while there this time. The sea is not my thing but was lovely to watch. Also cringing while people tried to get back to shore after being out so far and trying to avoid the huge waves.
All in all, I had a fantastic holiday and I will definitely return. Trying to book for next year already.",Date of stay: November 2017,Hotel Riu Touareg,1,"Boa Vista, Cape Verde"
Just gorgeous,Absolutely stunning views and gorgeous near white sand. Very clean and well kept. Sand is fine and does not stick like some.,Date of experience: November 2017,Santa Monica Beach,1,"Boa Vista, Cape Verde"
Always good,"If seeing family or going into town, this hotel is one of the better ones we use. Would recommend it. Plenty of parking. Rooms and beds are lovely. Pub next door, great for a couple of drinks or food.",Date of stay: November 2017,Premier Inn Bristol Filton hotel,1,"Filton, United Kingdom"
Bit disappointed,"I wanted to eat here on my birthday which has just passed. It did fall on a Saturday which I do understand is an ideal night to go out for a curry. However, the place was so busy that they were hard pushed to find us (2) a table. When we did get seated, I felt ignored so we left. We did go back the next night and it was a lot less busy. I chose to have the chicken bhuna and i have to say, it was a little tasteless/bland. I also felt the service was nowhere near as good as when I went in June. The staff were completely different and I did not find them as friendly as the guys working there back in June. Such a shame.",Date of visit: October 2017,Spice of India,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Can't wait to visit again,"Gorgeous beach and bay, plenty of shops, bars and restaurants. Marina is fabulous with places to sit, have a drink and dream about which boat you would buy.",Date of experience: October 2017,Cala Gran,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Good as ever,"Stayed her for the second time, just arrived back. Didn't use the restaurant as it was my birthday weekend and we ate out all the time. But, we did use the bar, pool and sunbathing area. Room had a bit of a sea view though this was not at the front of the hotel or anything. Room was clean and also cleaned every day we were there. As I have said before, location is great for the town and marina which I love. Would stay again for sure and have booked for June next year.",Date of stay: October 2017,Gavimar Cala Gran Costa del Sur Hotel & Resort,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Return visits,This was my second time to Cala D'Or and I promised I would go back to this lovely bar. Which I did. The view out over the marina is fantastic. Had lunch on my birthday which was very nice. Also had a very good chat with the owner Graham. Will definitely be going back next year when I can take my sister with me.,Date of experience: October 2017,Jolly Roger,1,"Majorca, Spain"
"Drinks fab, food not so","Last time I was in Cala D'Or, myself and a friend said we wanted to visit this place. We never did. This time we made a point of going in and having a drink in the evenings. Wow, the measures are amazing and the staff friendly. On our last day we decided we would go there for a late lunch. I looked at the menu and nothing really jumped out at me so I went for the sirloin steak with mushroom sauce. I have to say, the service was not that great, no offer of salt & vinegar for the chips or other sauces. The mushroom sauce was bland and the steak, very rare in some places rather than medium as they had said it would be. A bit of a let down. However, I have to still say that in the evenings it has a nice feel to the place and the drinks are amazing & good value.",Date of visit: October 2017,Celler Ca's Brau,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Not bad,"Visited this restaurant as I had passed it during the day and had a chat with the manager. I did say I would return and have a meal so I did. I have to say, not the best. The Tzatziki was ok and then I had the kleftiko which wasn't all that. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back again.",Date of visit: September 2017,Milo's,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"

Wish I hadn't bothered,"Staff took hardly any notice of me and bordered on rude whenn they did finally, which as a female on my own I find not nice.

Mixed feelings....,"This was my second visit after many years to the Costas Apartments. I love their location and its a nice walk down to the beach and around the area back to the apartments and lovely pool that they have there.
Its quite obvious that many people are returning customers and go year upon year. Obviously know the staff very well. This is fantastic and shows the place is very popular, however for people that were new to the apartments and also myself who was not well known, did get ignored at the bar quite a lot. This is rather frustrating. However, that aside. I had a nice stay. The weather was great and I enjoyed it. Kalamaki in general I found has lost some of its charm and there is a lot of litter around in the areas of waste land and along the road ways. This is a real pity.",Date of stay: September 2017,Costas Apartments,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Good but not the best,"Considering this restaurant was packed every night, I did not find it to be the best in the resort. It was nice and service was fine but nothing spectacular.",Date of visit: September 2017,Heaven's Kitchen,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"

"Excellent food, friendly service","I cannot rate this kebab shop enough. I normally go in on a Sunday evening after work and I get greeted with the most friendly welcome.

Food is fantastic, fresh and packaged wonderfully.",Date of visit: August 2017,Kebab Land & Pizza's,1,"Addlestone, United Kingdom"
One drink per visit,"During my stay here with friends, they decided to change the rules for the bar and make it one drink pp per visit to the bar. Bit silly when by the time you've drunk that one you need to go and get another. Bungalows are dated but ok for what was needed. Stayed in a nicer part of the complex, other areas I saw were run down and looked awful. Breakfast was disgusting and not very much choice, always cold. Did not eat in on any evening.",Date of stay: April 2017,Castillo Beach Bungalows,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
"Excellent, going back","My stay in October 2016 was absolutely fantastic. Staff cannot do enough for you. Food is very good. Loads of choice and the restaurants that you book are also very good. African was my favourite. During my stay I had a birthday, I was given a bottle of prosecco in my room and two more at dinner in the Asian restaurant. Brilliant. Going back November as a solo traveller and cannot wait to see everyone there. Pool is lovely, plenty of sunbeds.",Date of stay: October 2016,Hotel Riu Touareg,1,"Boa Vista, Cape Verde"
Excellent location,"Arrived back Wednesday 14th June. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by a very informative receptionist, a glass of bubbly and our room was ready straight away. This was good as we had arrived very early.
The rooms are a little dated and ours did not have a fridge which would have been helpful for water. But the room and bathroom were clean and tidy. Beds are very comfortable and the shower was very good too.
We stayed all inclusive and though the lunch and evening meal choice was very good. The breakfast I found not to be very appetizing. They seemed to have a lot of German guests, which although does not bother me in the slightest, I felt the breakfast suited their tastes more than us. Generally we skipped breakfast each day for that reason.
The pool area was very clean and plenty of sunbeds. However, because it is a free for all and these can be put anywhere around the pool, it causes problems if you arrive a little later and need to squeeze in. There was no uniform way of having the sunbeds so I don't think it makes good use of the space there. Pool was very refreshing but not cold.
Location is fantastic, a short walk to the marina which is gorgeous and lots of other eating places and bars to try along the way. The beach right across the road and can be seen from the pool.
Staff I have to say are not very attentive. Adriano in the pool bar area was the only member of staff that I can comment on as going over and above to make sure we were happy. He is very good at his job and very good with the customers.
The 'animation' leaves a lot to be desired though the team try really hard with what they have to work with. Very energetic and friendly and there is always something to do each day if you wish to join in. Some good holiday style music around the pool which was nice to listen to, though some thought it too loud. All in all a good trip but I think if I visit again, I will go self catering in an apartment.",Date of stay: June 2017,Gavimar Cala Gran Costa del Sur Hotel & Resort,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Friendly bar with great service & views,"After seeing this place on here, I asked in the Q&A how far it was from our hotel. Ruth the owner came back straight away to advise. She wasn't wrong as 10 mins down the road and we were there, Sipping a prosecco and looking out over the marina.
Service here is fab with Emma, Ruth, Christian and Graham looking after you. Prices are in line and you cannot beat sitting here on an afternoon with the sun on your shoulders and looking at the gorgeous boats on the water. A great find and I will definitely be back without doubt.",Date of experience: June 2017,Jolly Roger,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Excellent food and service fantastic,"I love my Indian food however my friend does not. This restaurant was kind enough to allow an adult version of a kids meal. The food was absolutely excellent, just so much I couldn't finish it. Even during a long power cut, the atmosphere was brilliant and a waiter even gave a couple his flashlight to continue their meal.
A fantastic eating experience and I would definitely return.",Date of visit: June 2017,Spice of India,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Will not return....,"Just returned from a week here for a friends hen week. Arrived early evening and were given our keys promptly, told the directions to the rooms and the restaurant. We were allocated two bungalows next to each other which was great.
First impressions of the bungalows. Dated. They have everything you need and while we were all inclusive, we could still have cold water in the fridge etc.
The restaurant. Inadequate for the amount of people using it. Choice minimal. We ate breakfast out a couple of times. Lunch, the same. No real choice and just not enough. We ate dinner out every evening. Drinks wise, the pool bar which was mainly inside had your usual on tap. Local spirits available too. Halfway through the holiday however they decided to change the two drinks per person rule to one. Now, on an all inclusive basis, I think that's really a poor show. The pool area was kept nice and clean by the life guard though he was not present everyday. There is not much for children here either.
As this is a place that location wise is situated out of town, if you were relying on a complete all inclusive holiday with no eating or drinking out, don't book this hotel. If you want friendly staff who can't do enough for you, don't book here. If you want nice food and plentiful drink, don't book here. The cleaning of the apartments is not good. I shared with two others so I was on the sofa bed. My bed linen was not changed all week. Beds were never made. They seemed to take the towels away and yet not replace them. As for toilet roll, given two and never topped up. We brought our own. All inclusive I don't think so!! Will not be returning.",Date of stay: May 2017,Castillo Beach Bungalows,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Tough chicken,"We were staying at Castillo Beach so this place was on the way to town. Had not tried it before on previous holidays do thought we would give it a go.
Took a long time to be served, when the food came out my friends chicken dish was cold. It was sent back, took forever to be returned and when it was, it had been chopped up and obviously heated. Which made it tough as old boots. It was not edible.
The waiter did not ask if everything was ok. Though, I have to say, though we were not impressed that evening, we returned to have breakfast which was very nice and very cheap. My friends order unfortunately was mixed up so one person out of three was not impressed again. Wouldn't go back.",Date of visit: May 2017,Kobe Steakhouse,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Brilliant night out,"Thankyou to all the staff at Bar 4 for making my friends hen week. Great atmosphere. The bubbly and shots were much appreciated.
I've got to say, karaoke is not my thing but Shaun on the mic makes it. Made some good friends and will return next year.",Date of visit: May 2017,Bar 4,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Disappointing visit,"I recently visited the boathouse restaurant at the bridge hotel with my father for some lunch.

On arrival the bar staff were less than attentive but after being served our drinks, I advised them we would find a table as we would like to eat.

At least half an hour or more had passed without a sign of a menu being produced. When I asked for them at the bar, it took 2 people to find the tatty menus'.

Again, we waited sometime before being asked what we wanted to order. The food came fairly quickly but half of it was only luke warm. I actually couldn't be bothered to complain about this as generally we know it'll be stuck under a heat lamp which dries everything up anyway.

Needless to say, we were not impressed with our visit this time. I can see that majority of staff are different from last time i went and I have to say, none of them are an asset to the business.",Date of stay: March 2017,"Bridge Hotel, Chertsey",1,"Chertsey, United Kingdom"
Friendly and welcoming,"I have been to this pub before but never on my own. As a single female, though working in the pub trade myself I'm not always the bravest person.

They both made me feel very comfortable and I did not feel awkward at all ordering my wine in a nearly all male clientele pub. I would be happy to do so again.",Date of visit: March 2017,O'Neill's Pub and Grill,1,"Woking, United Kingdom"

Hard working staff...,"This was possibly my 6th visit to Caleta Garden apartments and I was glad to be back. I instantly feel at home here. On arrival I asked about a room I had asked for, the receptionist was very helpful but advised that this room would not be available and we had been allocated another. Initial disappointment led to happy campers as the room we were given was right on the pool side. Very handy for jumping in and out during the day. Once again, the room was cleaned to a brilliant standard and the cleaners seem to be in action all day long.
All the staff work so hard at this hotel and you never see them slacking. I have to make a special mention to Irene who seemed to work all the hours she could over my stay. Service with a smile from her and Lydia. The beer was cold and measures large so no complaints there. Food wise, we only stayed for breakfast though we were all inclusive we mainly used this for the drinking side of things. The food hall has been re-vamped and now is light and airy. Makes all the difference.
My only complaint from my stay this time is that the sunbeds seemed to be unlocked later and later every day. On previous visits, it was 9.00 pretty sharpish and this was good in my eyes. 10.00/10.30 is too late for most people wanting to get a space pool side. Maybe this could be looked at by the management. But all in all, a fab few days. Back again in October/November.",Date of stay: September 2015,Aparthotel Caleta Garden,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"

The pool is kept lovely and clean, lots of sunbeds to choose from though you always have your favourite don't you. Ate breakfast here every day and was cooked by Mama, even things that were not on the menu are catered for.
Lovely cold Efes and a plentiful range of other drinks too. Mehmet made a couple of cocktails for me which went down very well. This place is a tiny paradise for me with a spacious balcony overlooking the mountains and being able to watch the village come to life in the mornings.

Can't wait to get back,"I think this must be my 6th visit to this hotel. Having re-read some of the reviews again and some of the more recent ones. I am really pleased to see that the manager is responding to some of the comments made. I, myself cannot wait to get back there in a couple of weeks time. I am booked in for 5 nights all inclusive just for some time by myself, however, as I have been a few times before, I know the staff will recognise me and be their ever jolly, helpful and friendly selves. These guys are the main reason I choose this hotel. It does sound like some improvements have been made but for me, it doesn't matter. More than once I have been allocated the room I have asked for, which to me is great service. Even if the room is not ready, you instantly get your band for using the facilities which is also a good touch and your holiday can immediately start.
The staff work long shifts and yet keep smiling the whole time, having banter with the guests and working hard to keep everyone happy and the bar tidy.
See you in 20 days when I will be there again to enjoy my stay. I will write yet another review with my findings and updates on any improvements. Keep up the good work people of Caleta Gardens.",Date of stay: November 2014,Aparthotel Caleta Garden,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"

Once service was given, the food was excellent and service also so good. We were given a voucher for 10% off as well.
On another night when we could not decide where to go, we went back. Again everything was excellent and they all remembered us from the previous time. On paying, the waiter went to give me another voucher. I explained that I had the other one at the hotel in my other bag and that we were leaving the following day. He still gave us the 10% off which I thought was a lovely gesture as it was my fault I'd left it behind. Will definitely be going back next year when I return.",Date of visit: November 2014,La Bodeguita,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Fantastic venue for lunch snack or romantic dinner,"This was my first time visiting this restaurant/bar. My sister had been earlier in the year and suggested I take my Mum there. We were staying AI at Caleta Garden so the walk along the pathway past all the rocks and past the harbour, all the way along to this place was lovely and a good walk too. The day was not too bright on the day we went but decided to carry on anyway. I am glad we did. We had a beer each and some lunch which was a burger for Mum and club sandwich for me. Huge portions and I we could not finish them. Really good value too and the service was great. It has to be said, you could go here purely for the location as you feel like your in the middle of the sea. Really worth a visit.",Date of visit: November 2014,Beach Club Chiringuito La Isla,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Good for a quick drink,"Primarily an Irish bar, this place a nice friendly welcome and atmosphere. I felt quite comfortable in here. Drinks are reasonable as well as the food. I was not all that impressed with my salad I had but I am sure the more main meals are very good. Clientele seems to be a lot of local ex pats who go in for the football, rugby and racing for which the staff take bets.
Had afternoon drinks, sitting outside some days and this was more enjoyable than the evening. All in all though, a very friendly place to chill.",Date of visit: November 2014,The Step Inn,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Fantastic late break,"Recently stayed here with my sister after finding an excellent deal online. Arrived at the airport in anticipation as neither of us knew what to expect. Transfer from the airport was about an hour but very scenic and we saw some lovely countryside on the way.
Dropped at the door to the hotel which we immediately found welcoming with excellent reception staff explaining everything we needed, where our room was located etc. Room was very spacious, clean, huge terrace area, toiletries provided, comfy beds and an excellent luxury shower.
We headed down for our lunch as we were all inclusive to find again staff were friendly and helpful, food was plentiful and hot. Lots of salad. Cakes for after etc. The surrounding area is a little cliché and tired but has a few shops and bars.
Evening meals also excellent with plenty of choice and different themes most nights. The weather we had was really good for the time of year so we were lucky. Would definitely think of going again.",Date of stay: October 2014,Mar Hotels Ferrera Blanca,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Another excellent stay,"Literally arrived back yesterday from this hotel. It was my 5th stay but my mum's first. I'd told her to keep an open mind as caleta garden is a place you could easily dislike. Many reviews on here will state exactly that but for a budget hotel it has mostly everything you need.
Location is excellent and the staff are brilliant. The hotel itself I feel has improved since I visited last as in there are more staff on hand, they seem happy in their work. The food was slightly better too. The cleaners work so hard everyday to keep the place and rooms clean but the whole hotel needs some TLC. As I say, for a budget break you need to take it for what it is and not stick your nose in the air when they don't offer cava on the all inclusive drinks menu. It is a 2 key complex and if you want 4 or 5 star you need to be heading to the likes of the Barceló, the Sheraton or the Geranios suites. But you will pay a price for these places too. Overall a brilliant trip for me and my mum as we had a great week together, I would still go back.",Date of stay: November 2014,Aparthotel Caleta Garden,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
First of many.....,"Returned from my visit to Sun Village Apartments in the Old Village on October 4th. This was the first time staying at these apartments even though I've walked past them many times on my way into town along the dry canal. My apartment was the top floor overlooking the pool which was fantastic for the views. Though the pool is small, it is more than sufficient for the amount of rooms in the block. Plenty of sunbeds available and majority get the sun for most of the day. The staff are fantastic and cannot do enough for you. Myself and my friend ate breakfast there every day and sometimes had a lovely prepared salad for lunch.
My stay was arranged as always by ICR including my transfer which was a little longer this time due to the amount of drop offs. ICR girls in the office really look after me and helped me to arrange a gorgeous boat trip and Michelle even came with us. I really enjoyed my stay at Sun Village and have booked again for May 2015, same room. I have even booked my flights and managed to get a really good deal on them.
The rooms at Sun Village are spacious and very clean. Quite modern in decoration and every one of them is pool facing. Balcony is also quite large and the beds are very comfortable. I will definitely be visiting here more than once next year.",Date of stay: September 2014,ICR Sun Village Apartments,1,"Icmeler, Turkey"
Hassle,Totally got caught out with the hassle from the guys here. When I usually visit Icmeler I never go but ended up having a drink in here this time. Not again.,Date of visit: September 2014,Romance Palace,1,"Icmeler, Turkey"
Food excellent when it arrives,"This was my third visit to the restaurant and I have say the food is still very good but the service could be better. We were seated straight away and I thought that was the start of a good evenings service, it was not. The staff took some time to hand us the menu's and then even longer to take our order. Once done, an age to wait for the food. Once on the table, the food is amazing. I had fajitas and they are very good. Plenty of meat, sauces and tortillas. I will go again because I will know what to expect and if you are happy to wait for service then I would say give this place a try.",Date of visit: April 2014,Wild West Steak House,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
5 star it is not.....,"First of all, this is my 3rd visit so I knew what to expect when I arrived. The staff I have to say are very good at what they do, from reception through to the bar, they are happy and smiling and very helpful. Freddie especially. We arrived just slightly too late for the all inclusive bar but had a drink anyway as the bar was still serving till midnight.
First morning came and we went to breakfast, as usual plenty of choice and you can easily find something for everyone, my only complaint was that there were no tinned tomatoes and the beans were cold. Everything else, lovely. Now it comes to the sunbeds, yes they are locked up until about 9.00am when the maintenance man comes to unlock them once the cleaners have finished around the pool. I cannot tell you how many people moaned that they were locked but I feel this quite a fair way of dealing with them, it means they do not get trashed during the night or thrown in the pool, they all get hosed down and everyone queues quite nicely to get their bed. There were people who took say 4 which were for themselves and 2 of their kids, the children however did not use their bed once during the day which must have been rather annoying for people coming a little later that needed a bed. I myself allowed a couple to have mine and my friends beds during the afternoon when we walked to the beach and on our return sat in the bar area.
Now, the bar area. Plenty of tables and seats. I must say, it actually got very hot during the late afteroon too and I even moved inside on one afternoon. The tables are cleared often and tables wiped down. Again bar staff doing a brilliant job during this hot period of the day. During our stay a group of young people arrived who were, lets say a little more rowdy than the usual clientele. Unfortunately, they had taken it upon themselves to sneak in a bottle of very strong shot alcohol which they passed around them all whilst drinking pints of lager. I think most people realised it would all end in tears which happened when one of the girls fell over by the pool and bumped her head quite badly. The staff I cannot say controlled the situation but it did then calm down immediately.
The rooms, they are dated and the beds are a little small and uncomfortable. This did not bode well in my case this time as I had hurt my ribs before arriving and meant I could not sleep very well. Last time I stayed, the bed was fine. Rooms are kept spotlessly clean and the balcony though at the front of the hotel was not noisy and kept some sun during the afteroon too. All in all this hotel is a great base as it is right in the heart of the main resort. Walk to the beach can be long or short whichever route you take. I will be going back and soon. It is completely adequate for your needs and people do have to remember it is only a 2 key hotel not a 5 star Hilton. Most deals on this hotel are cheap. I do understand that some people may not have the money to go outside of the hotel to eat but if it can be done, I would say go for it.",Date of stay: April 2014,Aparthotel Caleta Garden,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Excellent pizza,"I cannot say I like this pub very much, purely based on clientele but their pizza's are excellent. They also have a deal of a meal and a pint which is excellent value",Date of visit: March 2014,The Prince Regent,1,"Chertsey, United Kingdom"
Great for breakfast,"Cannot beat this place for breakfast, either pick off the menu or make up your own, either way, tasty and great value",Date of visit: March 2014,Chertsey Cafe,1,"Chertsey, United Kingdom"
Excellent service even at 3am,"Myself and my friends use this takeaway a lot due to them delivering so late into the evening. We all work late shifts and can sometimes call at 2am, they are always friendly and for value you cannot beat them.",Date of visit: November 2013,Pizza Hot Express,1,"Chertsey, United Kingdom"
