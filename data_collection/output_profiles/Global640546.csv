Boat trip,"What a great day!! A little fishing with the nets hauling in the catch, great local knowledge and genuine hospitality. Lots of swimming opportunities and hands on with the catch. Lovely crew always attentive to each passenger. Lovely to eat what was caught, fish has never been so fresh. More swimming in blue seas and a glimpse of a turtle on the way back. Superb day for anyone",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
