Awesome experience,"Enjoyed an excellent day out with the charming Captain Dimities - "" Jimmy "" who could not have been more accommodating on our private half day boat hire to take us to the stunning Lalarai Beach & Arch , stopping at all the sea caves & notable sights for great photo opportunities ...would thoroughly recommend this guy & his boat . He knows how to catch big fish too !",Date of experience: June 2017,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
Great Location & style,"Enjoyed a lovely 2 night stay at this brand new property. Very chic & stylish but at the same time welcoming with friendly staff at the Reception & especially in both restaurants.
Excellent location for all sightseeing , especially the Acropolis , & excellent service & fine dining on the roof top restaurant that must have one of the best views in all of Athens. Terrace is small though so you need to reserve in advance to get a table outside.
Included breakfast was also of a very high quality with friendly service.",Date of stay: June 2017,AthensWas Design Hotel,5,"Athens, Greece"
Simply the best in Skiathos,"These villas are indeed very luxurious & well cared for with excellent & attentive service from the lovely Victoria who acted as your own personal concierge & was very welcoming & helpful with transfers & car rental & anything that came up.
The views are spectacular & the pool great to the point that you really had to tear yourself away from the villa to explore the island , which is a MUST as there are so many beautiful beaches & places to discover. I can honestly say that this is the first VRBO property that I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending as there are simply no significant negatives. Villa is very comfortable with good AC , only feedback would be for more storage space in kitchen & bedrooms but it really is perfect for a week & the restaurant on the beach nearby RADA is great for lunch & dinner !",Date of stay: June 2017,Golden King Villas,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
"Fabulous location, service & food..this place is very special !","Well worth the journey to get to it however you do it.....we arrived by private charter plane which was spectacular & the welcome was as warm as ever ! Out of all the restaurants & 4 star hotels we stayed in, this place has by far the best food in Costa Rica & you don't even have to choose from a menu ! You really feel at one with nature in thei beautiful property & the staff can't do enough to ensure you enjoy your stay.Be prepared for bugs but nothing too overwhelming & being withour a/c for a few nights is all part of the "" jungle experience"" but it's still a ""quality "" eco-lodge for the adventurous traveller ! Would definitely recommend it & plan to go back..awesome for couples or families..even with teenagers ! All the nature tours they offer are superb with incredibly knowledgable local guides. Special thanks to Harry at the restaurant for always being so acommodating !",Date of stay: August 2011,Tortuga Lodge & Gardens,5,"Tortuguero, Costa Rica"
