A sea urchins flavored trip,"Absolutely recommended.
In our trip we visited the most well-known beaches in Skiathos north-area but also the less touristic and accessible areas (e.g. caves, beaches, rocks), thanks to the experience of the boat master Dimitris.
Dimitris prepared for us an afternoon break with fresh fruit in lalaria beach, and a Sunset aperitivo with fresh sea urchins (which he fished in the morning for us) and white wine ... a beautiful experience in a faboulus island.",Date of experience: August 2017,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
