Great fishing trip,"We had a great morning fishing trip with our 3 and 6 year old sons. Everyone caught fish without too much difficulty. We were made to feel very welcome aboard and changed places lots of times and so visited the bay. Thank you so much Sostis, this was definitely the highlight of our holiday.",Date of experience: October 2018,Sostis & Saratonga Faliraki Fishing Trips,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
