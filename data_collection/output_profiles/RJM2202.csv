A trip that has a bit of everything,"Thoroughly enjoyable 5 hours out on this fishing trip. Site seeing, sea fishing, swimming in the caves and a beautiful BBQ cooked on board washed down with a few beers.

Would certainly recommend this to anyone",Date of experience: October 2020,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Greek hospitality at its best,"Thought we would visit the old town of Rhodes whilst on holiday and stumbled upon this traditional Greek taverna come grill house. The food was home cooked and so nice. Try the home cooked cake for dessert that has been baked that day. Lovely.

The service was so friendly and nothing too much trouble. To top it all off the cost was very reasonable.

Couldn’t fault it.",Date of visit: October 2020,Hermes Greek Grill House,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
It’s simple - this is the best Indian restaurant,"It’s simple - this is the best Indian restaurant whether eating in or taking out. I’ve never had a bad meal, superb!",Date of visit: May 2020,Salim's Indian Restaurant,4,"Loughborough, United Kingdom"
Beautiful,"It’s got everything you need, blue, clear, clean sea, sandy beach and reasonably priced comfortable sun loungers.

A vast array of bars, cafes and restaurants nearby to enjoy some lunch or an evening meal when the suns gone down

A great relaxing day out",Date of experience: September 2019,Burriana Beach,4,"Nerja, Spain"
Great Food & Great Service,"We have just been to Nerja for a weeks holiday and ate at Trattoria Italia twice. It is situated in the heart of the town near to all other bars and restaurants. On each occasion the food and service was fantastic. Fresh, tasty food and the portion sizes are very generous. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and the prices are also very reasonable.",Date of visit: September 2019,Trattoria Italia,4,"Nerja, Spain"
Slightly disappointed,This was the first time I have visited Gaucho Birmingham and it was not as good as the occasions I visited the London Bridge and Piccadilly restaurants. It is not the cheapest steak restaurant and it just felt like it was lacking in quality and certainly was not value for money. Steaks were slightly undercooked to what we asked for.,Date of visit: August 2019,Gaucho Birmingham,4,"Birmingham, United Kingdom"
Quality In every way,Visited here with family whilst on holiday. Can’t believe we’ve never been here before when visiting Playa. We are outside and ordered off the Chinese menu rather than going for the tepanyaki experience. The food and the service was top notch and not to expensive either.,Date of visit: July 2019,Imperial Tai-Pan,4,"Tenerife, Spain"
Nothing too much trouble,"From booking the flight on the website, to checking in at the airport and then on the flight, I cannot fault the service throughout. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and we always find them competitive with regard to price. You also seem to get a little more leg room in the plane!",Date of travel: June 2019,Jet2.com,4,World
Burgers to die for,"We visited here for the first time after my brother recommended it. Great setting overlooking the beach, relaxed atmosphere and the burgers are superb. Great value for money and would be somewhere I would revisit.",Date of visit: June 2019,Lucky 7's Burger Joint,4,"Tenerife, Spain"
The Best Italian Restaurant in Leicester,"It was our first time at Oggi’s. The food and wine was superb. The service faultless and a great atmosphere.

Would have no hesitation in recommending it",Date of visit: June 2019,OGGI Simply Italian,4,"Leicester, United Kingdom"
