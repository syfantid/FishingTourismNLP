Fresh & tasty sushi,"Visited with my daughter after checking trip advisor. First thing to notice when walking in is how calming it feels. The lighting is low and the music is gentle. We were served by a friendly waitress who was happy to help with the menu and recommend various dishes. We opted for a sharer with a mixture of salmon & tuna. It was beautiful and tasted delicious. The sushi rolls were full of flavour but delicate enough to “feel” every different ingredient. It’s the best sushi I’ve had.

My daughter also loved it and enjoyed the Japanese lemonade immensely! We will definitely go back to this wonderful place in the heart of the city centre.",Date of visit: November 2018,Sushi Passion,1,"Birmingham, United Kingdom"
Spellbindingly good food,"Visited with my girlfriend for a spot of lunch after local recommendations. We had a mixture of tapas dishes and a couple of drinks.

Menu is diverse and well thought out. The food is loaded with flavours and all the tapas dishes we tried were mouthwatering. The ambience is peaceful and relaxed, staff are attentive and friendly. Decor was unique too. It’s the best tapas we’ve ever had and that includes Ibiza (the home of tapas). Keep up the massively good work and Thankyou for the amazing food!",Date of visit: September 2018,Paramo Lounge,1,"Solihull, United Kingdom"
Complete Garbage,"Visited here on a windy, cold Sunday night with my girlfriend after searching for some tasty food. Firstly, there was no one in the restaurant which isn’t a good sign. We were given menu (limited and expensive) and drinks menu.

After looking through it (and being hassled and made to feel uneasy by the waiter in black) we decided on a number of dishes such as the fillet steak, chicken, king prawns etc. All were swimming, and I mean SWIMMING in putrid oil. It was disgusting and totally unnecessary. We’ve never ate tapas so disappointing and been ripped off for the privilege. Will NOT be returning and I urge anyone who thinks about walking through these doors to....not.",Date of visit: October 2018,Salud Tapas Bar and Restaurant,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
Food and service of the century,"Visited with my girlfriend recently after local recommendations. It’s a beautiful place with breathtaking views. The staff are very attentive (Sara in particular) and happy in their jobs.

The food is the best either of us have EVER had. It was a pleasure to dine here. The dishes are well thought out, spectacular in their presentation and taste like heaven. The menu is smaller than most places, and I preferred that as they are so good it’s all you need. We will be back for sure.",Date of stay: July 2018,The Horn Of Plenty,1,"Gulworthy, United Kingdom"
Deliciously eventful,"Visited with my girlfriend recently and loved it. The food is spectacular and the service was impeccable. I had sea bass which was loaded with flavour, garlic bread was beautiful with a dash of thyme on top. Sticky toffee pudding for desert was the best we’d had (and massive)!

We will be visiting again if in the area. Highly recommended.",Date of visit: June 2018,Bill's Covent Garden (St Martin's Courtyard),1,"London, United Kingdom"
Super!,"Visit here as often as possible as prices are good and choice is vast. I love the Levi, diesel, all Saints, NB shops. Have everything you need in one tidy and clean place. Staff are helpful, discounts are inevitable (take a student card as this can be used in several places although they don’t advertise it). Always leave happy!

Will of course be back (as soon as poss)!",Date of experience: June 2018,Cheshire Oaks Designer Outlet,1,"Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom"
Cracking Place!,"Stayed for 2 nights after Easter bank holiday with my daughter, niece and mum. Hotel is in an excellent position situated within 5 minute walk of the pleasure beach. Graham the friendly chap who greeted us on arrival keeps a spotless hotel, his breakfasts are out of this world, his bar is extraordinary excellent & full of character AND the staff are friendly. What more could you want???

Needless to say, “the Mead’s” will return!!",Date of stay: April 2018,Clifton Court Hotel,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
Beautifully Nostalgic,"Visited with my daughter, niece and mum. We all loved it. I used to go as a child and not much has changed - but this is why it’s so good! There is something for everyone and all ages. The “big one” is still the best in my opinion. Grand national also exhilarating, as is “ice blast”. Food and drink outlets are available in abundance so all tastes are catered for. If you like burgers, try the burger bar next to the fountains as they are delish!

Despite the chill in the air, we all had the best time ever. Keep up the good work please and see you soon no doubt.",Date of experience: April 2018,Blackpool Pleasure Beach,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
An intense 360 of Blackpool,"Booked this trip on pleasure beach website as this was the best value option. Check the website thoroughly though as you can pick and choose which experiences you want to add. We picked the tower and dungeon.

After a short queue we were led to a 4D cinema with a “before” and “after” film of Blackpool and it’s history which we all really liked.

Then......up the lift and to the top of the breezy and dramatic tower. As soon as I stepped out I had a blast of searing wind. I definitely felt alive up there. Views are stunning and the weather was sunny so we were able to see for miles. You must stand on the glass and look down, I did, and my belly did a somersault.

This is one of Blackpool’s main attractions and I implore everyone to visit.",Date of experience: April 2018,The Blackpool Tower,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
Mediocre with dull staff,"Visited on Friday 30th March with my girlfriend, daughter and daughters friend. Greeted by nobody at all on entry to the restaurant, which wasn’t a good start. Seated at thoroughly vile and sticky table which was blamed on “varnish” by member of staff. Girlfriend visited the toilets to find that all 5 cubicles were empty of toilet roll. When she mentioned this to a member of staff, the waitress went to the men’s and got a half empty roll from there! Wow.

What is quite worrying is the 2-4-1 is a fiddle. The children’s meals with classed as free against the much more expensive adult mains. What a con, and very sneaky. Children’s meals are non existent apart from “fishfingers” anyhow.

Food is good which is a positive. I had the Persian lamb which was tasty and well presented. The pint of peroni was a clean, sharp taste too. Starters were ok but not spectacular.

Overall, there is much better places to eat and drink in the area and the 2 most basic problems this place has, is disinterested staff and zero ambience. A shame, given the unique setting.",Date of visit: April 2018,The Old GlassHouse,1,"Dudley, United Kingdom"
The Best Ever,"I found Anita after a quick google search and picked her based on many 5 star reviews. She is a revelation! Had initial consultation (whilst holding me in a stretch) and went through my various ailments and long term injuries. She pinpointed issues in my lower limbs I didn’t even know would cause problems. She worked hard on my body and gave me a multitude of stretches to do on my hamstrings especially - who’d of thought that tight hamstrings would cause lower back pain?? Anita is confident in her approach, the most knowledgable person in the trade I have EVER come across and has overflowing passion for her job. I wound highly recommend her to family and friends. Her aftercare is also sublime as she sent me advice and pictures of stretches to continue to do at home.

She wants every person who walks through the door to be independent and free of specialists and to “work” on their own body. I must admit that I’ve never heard a specialist say this before! Try Anita and you’ll be amazed. I promise!",Date of experience: November 2017,Massage Therapies,1,"West Bromwich, United Kingdom"
Something for everyone and fresh,"Visited with my daughter on a very busy Saturday. If your unsure of what you fancy then please go here. There is sushi, Mexican, Chinese, Indian, British and everything in between. The food is good quality and very fresh. At £16.99 for an adult and £8.50 for a child you can’t go wrong especially for the mixture of amazing food on offer. I would recommend booking as I did, due to the vast amount of people clogging (waiting for tables) up the entrance to the restaurant and also to the food area!

Bear in mind all who enter though - you have to stick to a 2 hour time slot for your visit! I’d say it’s enough time for most people though.

Staff were also attentive and friendly on our visit and its somewhere we will go back to. My daughter especially loved the sushi as did I.",Date of visit: November 2017,COSMO Wolverhampton,1,"Wolverhampton, United Kingdom"
"An informative, hands on delight","Visited with my daughter who is 11 years old. We had booked the half day animal keeper via groupon (make sure you book a few weeks prior to your visit as gets very busy). We had a brief introduction as to which enclosure we’d go to first. Saw owls, snakes, hedgehog (called Brian), meerkats (my daughters favourite), big cats, a 43 year old tortoise weighing 12 stone (more than me)! It was a brilliant day with clearly passionate keepers who knew their craft exceptionally well. The chap with the owl was particularly knowledgable and a friendly guy. Would recommend to others and would go back myself. First class experience and fairly local from Wednesbury (about 35 mins).",Date of experience: October 2017,Hoo Farm Animal Kingdom,1,"Telford, United Kingdom"
Astonishgly good,"Visited on a Sunday in late august having never been before, despite living 4 miles down the road (terrible I know).
My overall feeling is that it's a fabulous place to visit. Loads to see and do. Fully interactive for adults and kids whilst you learn along the way. The mine experience was my personal favourite as you get guided along the way by a very knowledgable local chap, with clever bits of recorded voices playing the various roles of life size models throughout the mine. It's unreal to think that as a small 9 year old boy all those years ago, that your working life down the mines began. And what a horrendous existence it would of been. Pitch black, 12 hour shift, breathing in toxic coal dust.

There are old houses modelled both outside and in to reflect the decor of the times. Even down to the chopping boards, cutlery, carbolic soap, stoves, plates.....the list goes on. You really don't know where to look!

You HAVE to try the fish and chips - £20.17 for family size (2 x adult fish and chips, 2 x child fish and chips plus pickled eggs and onions) good value I thought and very tasty.

The fair ground is pretty good too with old rides and food/sweet/drink outlets. Take your money with you for that one though, as each ride costs £1.50 per go via a token system.

If you buy tickets online, you can go back for free (once) within 12 months. I'd say for me anyway, this is a definite as you can't possible squeeze everything in, in 1 day. We missed the cinema, school (where you have a lesson), tram ride and other bits. We will definitely return as the experience was the best I've had locally and I can't believe I've never been before. It is unique and hugely enjoyable. Please book your tickets and go. And then go again!

Historical indulgence on a boat,"Visited same day as Black Country museum trip as made sense with the glorious weather. We paid for family ticket and waited for next excursion to arrive.

You don your hard hats, board the canal boat and off you go. All this whilst a well versed and knowledgable local guide talks you through each landmark and piece of interest. The light show is particularly stunning and people even get married deep within the cave!!

My daughter and her cousin had a go at ""legging"" which is the art of using your legs to push the boat through the long and dark tunnels. Can't believe a local chap did this from the age of 13 to 70-odd. Must have had thighs like oak tree's!

This is another experience where you retain your ticket and then go back for free within 12 months. I would highly recommend this trip as it's something completely different and really enjoyable. Kids especially would love it. My daughter and niece are ages 11 and 10 and didn't stop talking about it.",Date of experience: September 2017,Dudley Canal & Tunnel Trust,1,"Dudley, United Kingdom"
Top notch,"Stayed June with my daughter (11 years old) for 1 week. Greeted on arrival by ""sosos"" (spelt wrong maybe but sounded like that) on reception. He was extremely welcoming after having arrived at 1.30pm shattered and hungry. A sandwich was waiting in my room and cold water in the fridge - such a nice touch.
The room we were in had a beautiful view overlooking the Aegean Sea. The room itself is modern and clean.
Food in restaurant is in plentiful supply, fresh and diverse. They had fish, meats, amazing salads, pasta dishes etc. Gloria is a really nice lady and chatty. All staff try their best for you and this attitude extends to all staff throughout the hotel from reception to cleaners.
Animation team are hard working but only average in my opinion. But to be fair to them we didn't get involved that much anyhow.
Pools are beautiful and it was a struggle to get my daughter out for closing time at 7pm! Like anywhere you go on holiday though, you must get out early AM to grab a sun lounger. Also, there were many sunloungers going unused all day but still with towels on. That got my back up a bit.

You must try try the boat trip situated on Rhodes harbour by the way (see my other review).
Rhodes old town is very quaint with plenty of souvenirs on offer. Restaurants are expensive though so be aware.

Overall the smart line cosmopolitan is clean, modern (have wi-fi too), serve great food and have attentive, approachable staff. I would recommend to anyone and will be returning. Thankyou for such a great stay and see you soon!

The ULTIMATE boat trip,"Recently went to Rhodes with my 11 year old daughter and booked this fishing trip. It was the best decision I made. The captain is one of the nicest blokes I've met. Showed patience when he taught my daughter to fish, cooked the BEST fresh fish I've ever tasted and stopped off by the beach whilst we all jumped in crystal clear (and warm) water. He even had a life jacket for my daughter as she was worried about jumping into the sea.
The trip is roughly 3.5 to 4 hours long, and is excellent value for money. I had a couple of ice cold beers on board and my daughter had orangeade (drinks are provided) The captain was a superb host and knowledgeable beyond belief about fishing. When I go back to Rhodes, I'll book the trip again.
We even had a picture with our captain at the end of the trip!",Date of experience: June 2017,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Nature at its best,"Visited on a busy weekend with my 10 year old daughter. She really loved it and had a huge smile on her face throughout the tour. Took photo after photo too! Boiling hot in there (26 degrees) so hang your coat in the cloakroom on way in.
The ant colony is something to behold and in my opinion it's worth going just to see that. Be aware though it gets a bit cramped in there when busy as pathways are so small.",Date of experience: May 2017,Stratford Butterfly Farm,1,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom"
Friendly and very welcoming,"Recently stayed here with my mate for the Anthony ""million dollar"" Crolla fight, which was a short tram ride away from the Manchester arena. The hotel was exceptionally clean and the room was spotless. Staff on arrival were very friendly too. Tram was a 10 minute walk and then tram into town a further 10 minutes. The Brewers fayre next door was really good food too. Decent value and plenty of choice. A further point to make - I left my charger in the room which a member of staff posted back to me. Excellent service and would definitely return.",Date of stay: September 2016,Premier Inn Manchester (Heaton Park) hotel,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
"Always fresh, always excellent",I visit here often as its consistently brilliant. Fish is fresh and not frozen. Very big and perfectly white portioned fish and great tasting chips is what carol delivers. It's the best in the area and I should know as I'm bloody fussy!,Date of visit: September 2016,Carols Chippy,1,"Wednesbury, United Kingdom"
"Friendly service, tasty food","I have visited here twice - once with my daughter and once with my Dad and Both times were fantastic. Lovely ambience too. Food is beautiful (I had fillet steak with peppercorn sauce my daughter had sea bass). You can tell that the menu is well thought out and there is something for everybody. Staff are attentive and really seem to enjoy their work. They've recently had work done to the outside of the building which to me, brings it up to the standard of how you will find it inside - superb!! Please visit as you won't will be disappointed. Book though as it gets busy.",Date of visit: September 2016,Casa Mia,1,"Wednesbury, United Kingdom"
"Fun day, long queues","Visited on the 22/5/16 with my 9 year old daughter. I find it a bit strange that so many people found it ""dirty"" at waterworld. The only place that I thought was dirty was the outside pool but to be fair that would be difficult to constantly keep clean with ACTUALLY being outside! Staff were attentive, car park was a bit annoying (especially finding £3 of change). The most frustrating part of the day was the poolside café. The queue was long but the staff were so slow it was unreal. Queued for probably an hour just to wait for a jacket potato and kids meal. It was nice when we got it though. Slightly older lady on till (red hair) is really friendly and smiled all day. I would definitely go to waterworld again. Maybe avoid the café though.......",Date of experience: May 2016,Waterworld,1,"Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom"
Superb food in a delightful restaurant,"Visited here with my daughter (she's 9) after hearing very good things about it. Wasn't disappointed. The menu was diverse with detailed descriptions of each dish. We chose a lamb dish with a chicken tikka massala and shared them between us.

Also ordered chips which when they arrived were actually home made! Never known that in an Indian restaurant before, it was a welcome surprise. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The music on the sound system was really soulful I thought, and added to the ambience of the place. Overall cinnamon court seems very well run, with generous food portions that are very flavoursome. The restaurant itself is very presentable and inviting too. Would definitely recommend to friends and family, and a revisit won't be far away from me either!

PS Thank you for the J20 - my daughter was over the moon with this!",Date of visit: November 2015,Cinnamon Court,1,"Walsall, United Kingdom"
Tasty and fresh food,"Visited here for Sunday lunch with my daughter after reading rave reviews on TripAdvisor. We were not disappointed. The Sunday lunch was exquisite. The meat (you a have a choice of beef, Turkey and pork) was beautifully tender and didn't need about 100 chomps per slice like some restaurant meat does. Yorkshires, veg, gravy etc were all perfect. Overall the place has a nice atmosphere and the staff are very friendly and attentive. Highly recommended and will visit again.",Date of visit: October 2015,Churchills bar,1,"Wednesbury, United Kingdom"
"Beautiful, fresh and flavoursome food","This Indian takeaway is a hidden gem. The menu is simple and uncomplicated, and the staff are helpful and friendly. It's a very welcoming place too. I chose the meal for one as it's a bit of a mixture of dishes. The lamb in particular was lovely tender meat and literally melt in the mouth. It is without doubt the best Indian takeaway I have ever had. Generous portions too. Will be visiting again and again!",Date of visit: September 2015,Shapla Indian Takeaway,1,"Llandudno, United Kingdom"
Delicious flavour full food,"Had a long wait as it was a gorgeous day and the restaurant was busy. It was well worth waiting for though as the food was tasty, fresh and expertly presented. Staff were very good and chatty. Coffee (flat white) was excellent. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend to other people and will definitely visit again.",Date of visit: July 2015,Pilot's Hub,1,"Redhill, United Kingdom"
Beautiful Beach,"Gorgeous beach. Clean, lovely food with friendly locals. Have to try beach cafe and have Cornish vanilla ice cream. Oh, hire a wind stopper for £2 at the surf shop. Don't buy one!",Date of experience: July 2015,Sennen Cove Beach,1,"Sennen, United Kingdom"
Glorious place,"Myself and my daughter stayed here only days ago and found it to be ultra friendly. The caravan was luxurious and clean. The entire caravan park is well maintained too. The owners are welcoming and forthcoming. A special note to Kerry here: thank you for the bed sheets and actually making the double bed for us! What a woman.
Bar is a nice size and filled with a nice bunch of people. Even got a visit from Skye (the dog) and the new puppy.

Craig was very helpful and gave us some good tips on eating out and days out when the weather is bad. Even printed off some info on where to get local fresh crab to take home!

Overall we loved our stay here. My daughter said she wants to come for a week next time. I told her ""no problem""!

Keep up the good work and see you next time.",Date of stay: July 2015,Roselands Caravan Park,1,"St Just, United Kingdom"
