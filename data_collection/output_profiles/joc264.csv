The most amazing day!,"What a day!!! A great fishing trip with Efi and Dimitris who treated us like royalty!! Homemade lemonade, wine and a banquet from the sea!! My 10 and 7 year old had a great time getting the fish from the net followed by a swim in the crystal clear waters. Efi and Dimitris were so friendly and made our day really special. I would highly recommend this as a must when visiting kefalonia.",Date of experience: May 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Amazing spa and facilities,Wow! Amazing spa and hotel! We visited as a party of 8 girls. We couldn't have asked for anything better. Our newly refurbished room was perfect and all of the staff so helpful. We would highly recommend it for a spa break.,Date of stay: April 2016,"The Waterfront Hotel, Spa & Golf",5,"Wyboston, United Kingdom"
