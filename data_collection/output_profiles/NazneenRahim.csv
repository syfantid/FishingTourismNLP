Beautiful views at sunset!,"We went during eh holiday season so the lines were long, and we decided to walk up the 6 flights of stairs to the observation deck, rather than wait in line for the elevators.",Date of experience: December 2019,Empire State Building,4,"New York City, New York"
Fabulous! Kind! Helpful! Delicious!,"We arrived in Melbourne, in the cold and starving. Checked in, then literally walked the streets in search of a very late lunch.
Thai Thani!
Wow! Authentic tasting Thai food. As a bonus, we were informed that the Chicken and Beef was Halal. What a treat!
Good portions. Worth every cent!
Lovely service by the owner herself, May.
What's more, we came back for dinner a few nights later!
Our family thoroughly enjoyed the food and would happily return if we were to visit Melbourne again.

Thank you May, and we wish you every success",Date of visit: August 2018,Thai Thani,4,"Fitzroy, Australia"
Three generations snorkeling together,"Wonderful experience. The crew were very friendly and helpful.
Leo, the photographer as well as the lady who arranged for the guided snorkeling tour were extremely helpful.
Awesome that they provide motion sickness tablets for free, and we're so quick to attend to those who had motion sickness.
We requested a Halal meal for our family and were amazed at the meal we received.
Packed separately and clearly marked, we were served a cold salad and fruit, as well as a hot chicken pasta.
I'd happily recommend this to Muslim families.
Well done guys! Keep it up.

As for what could be improved - the cleanliness of the toilets. This is not an oversight of the crew, however just an indication that more people with disgusting habits come on board.
Perhaps to have the toilets cleaned more often, if possible?

Thanks again for a lovely trip!",Date of experience: July 2018,Sunlover Reef Cruises,4,"Cairns, Australia"
50 minutes for the food to arrive,"It took 50 minutes for the food to arrive - the first order we made was egg fried rice x 3 & fried squid.
On hindsight, AUD 9 for egg fried rice was really pricey - really expected an amped up tasty egg fried rice - a really basic Chinese food take out version appeared.

Not the greatest spot to go if you want a quick meal and feed hungry, sleepy kids.

What was promised to be spicy was the prawn sambal - or at least a fusion based version of it.

Polite service, and we could see the chefs working really hard; it just took way too long.",Date of visit: July 2018,Mr Soy Boy,4,"Cairns, Australia"
Fabulous Food,"Wow! What a lovley find!
The crumbed baramundi was amazing.
They even had a sambal like sauce to go with it.
We also had the calamari which was delicious.

A gluten free option for the batter made the battered fish even more crispy than the original version.

Good service and the set up was delightful!
We're so very glad we stumbled upon it.

Well done to the team and thank you!",Date of visit: July 2018,Lucky Fish,4,"Palm Cove, Australia"

Amazing Family Experience,"The beautiful and accomplished Captain Anthi and her crew are now family.
Being a daughter of Santorini, she brought to life our experience by sharing with us her childhood memories of the Caldera. Our family which spans three generations, 4 seniors, 4 'middles, 4 kids ( 12 - 8), were very well taken care of.

Where else's would we have been able to jump into the deep blue sea, climb aboard to have a meal of freshly caught seafood, cooked by a member of her crew. The best part, was my husband being allowed to fry fish and cook a FULL BLOWN fish curry on board.

Enjoying that meal with Anthi and her crew was such a memorable experience.

Anthi and her crew are special and we pray for the success of Giorgaros fishing tours.
Her respect for the sea and her knowledge of the area truly provided us with an authentic and unforgettable experience.

Anthi, we are waiting for you and your fianc√© ( apologies as I have forgotten how to spell his name) to visit us in Malaysia

With much love, and heartfelt gratitude,
