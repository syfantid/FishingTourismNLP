Amazing Experience,"I did this for third time. Every time is getting better. Vasilis and Antonis are great people, the food excellent and the whole experience very relaxing and you can learn a lot of things if you ask. I suggest to everyone. Definitely, if I come next year in Rhodes, I will do it again. Great job, thank you...",Date of experience: September 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
