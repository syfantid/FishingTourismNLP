Forever Favorite,"My wife and I visited Venice for the first time a few weeks ago. We know we will be back and this is the only place we’ll ever stay.

Matteo has taken impeccable care of his property and is basically the finest of hosts you can find on this planet. I instantly fell in love with every little detail of this charming hotel, especially the balcony which we enjoyed breakfast, many a cappuccino, and many an aperol on.

The staff are some of the best we’ve ever encountered. They made our stay very pleasant and always greeted us by our first names. We felt cared for 24/7. Breakfast was plentiful and sumptuous with pastries baked daily by Matteo’s wife. Everything was delicious and we left to explore with full stomachs each morning.

Our room was upgraded granting us a lot of space; it had a large bed, couch, ottoman, and standing armoire. It was nice to spread out, especially within a city that can feel cramped.

Location wise, the hotel is perfect. We walked EVERYWHERE. The Vaporetto can be expensive and luckily we didn’t feel the need to take it, with the exception of when we had luggage.

We were both terribly sad to leave and I’m still thinking about my favorite balcony. If you can afford the splurge I would highly recommend anyone stay here. The peace and quality of this hotel are priceless.",Date of stay: February 2020,Al Ponte Antico Hotel,4,"Venice, Italy"
Always Dreamy,"My wife and I returned to Aenaon after two summers, and the day right after our wedding! There was no doubt about where we would be enjoying the remainder of our stay in Santorini.

Everything about Aenaon is impeccable, from design to service and hospitality. It really does feel like the most private and secret retreat. The mini fridge was always stocked with snacks and drinks. They treat us to some frappes since we had so many. We also came home to a bottle of chilled wine, glasses of Vinsanto, grapes, and chocolate soufflé on our last night! We just couldn’t have felt more special.

I brought my wedding bouquet with me and Aenaon provided a huge vase to keep it alive. I was grateful for this. The breakfasts are amazing as always, with plenty of options to start your day. We love the fresh squeezed orange juice. Each day we would receive a platter of fruits and ice cold water to cool down. Time by the pool is always a pleasure. We ordered a salad and bruschetta for lunch, both of which were fresh and delicious. We enjoyed these poolside.

Housekeeping kept our room pristine during the entire stay. Thank you for organizing our many belongings! Margarita was also always so kind to call us a taxi wherever we needed going. We really couldn’t ask for more.

I know there are millions of unbeatable views on the island but to me, Aenaon’s will always be the most serene and jaw dropping. Thank you, Elly, for treating us so well!",Date of stay: July 2019,Aenaon Villas,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Best Cocktails in Mykonos,"Elia beach is crowded these days and everyone wants to eat at this restaurant for a reason. We grabbed 4 loungers and spent the day eating, drinking, and soaking up the sun.

I wondered how they serviced so many loungers in a day and then noticed they have a convenient buzzer system at each one. All you have to do is hit a button and your server will come right away.

I ordered the club sandwich and some calamari for lunch, all of which was filling and delicious. I have to say, both were decently priced for Mykonos, as well. The COCKTAILS were scrumptious. I loved their Blackberry Bourbon Smash and Bubbly Raspberry. I had MANY of these.

I highly recommend this place for excellent service and food. It’s great for anyone!",Date of visit: July 2019,Restaurant Elia Beach,4,"Mykonos, Greece"
Amazing Food & Service 💞,"Missed out on Vegera last time I was in Mykonos so I suggested it to my wife, cousin, and her husband for dinner one night.

It’s one of the BEST meals we had in Greece, and we had a lot of wonderful meals. Everything was exceptional, the meat platter, mussels, risotto, and octopus. The mussels were so good we ordered them twice! I loved everything on the meat platter and the portion was perfect for our group.

Service was super friendly and attentive. Our server always had a smile. Not to mention, Vegera was PACKED but the staff were so on top of everything.

I absolutely recommend for lunch or dinner. You will not go wrong with choosing this lovely establishment.",Date of visit: July 2019,Vegera,4,"Mykonos, Greece"
Gorgeous View,"There are many incredible places to view the sunset in Santorini but this was a stunning setting for sure. Throubi definitely adheres to the beautiful Andronis design style and aesthetic. It was a lovely place to enjoy our meal.

Service was kind and attentive from start to finish. The staff was wonderful, for sure. The breads started off perfect. Then came our two apps, sea bass ceviche, and shrimp ceviche. Honestly we didn’t love either of these and felt the flavors fell flat, but the ingredients were fresh. Our mains, both fish, were excellent. I really loved the flavors in my dish.

We also tried a few cocktails, all of which were fantastic.

Overall, we appreciated Throubi for its romantic and relaxing atmosphere. Definitely a beautiful place to enjoy dinner.",Date of visit: July 2019,Throubi Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"
LOVE <3,"My wife and I got married in Santorini and were looking for a place to host drinks with friends before our wedding. I found STOA and immediately sent a message based on lovely pictures of the bar. It looked spacious, cool, and had shisha! Stathis (the owner) was immediately responsive and checked in with me every so often for a whole year up until we arrived in Santorini. I cannot say enough wonderful things about him. He was so welcoming and kind, constantly checking in on our group of 30-40 friends. He struck up conversation with my parents, family, and friends!

The drinks made by Angel (the super friendly mixologist) were amazing and I can't thank him enough for being so kind to us. Service is just stellar at STOA. Stathis really knows what he is doing. The cocktails flowed all night and the staff was attentive to the shishas. They also played plenty of music we loved so we could dance the night away, which many of us did.

Many of our friends ended up visiting STOA again throughout their stay, which is just a testament to how chill the place is. Stathis even gave us some quality parting gifts; I will never forget his generosity and hospitality. Kudos to this lovely establishment.

I highly recommend STOA to anyone looking for great cocktails and unbeatable service. Great for couples, friends, and just anyone! Thank you for everything! <3",Date of visit: July 2019,Stoa Santorini,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Overpriced & Underwhelming,"My wife and I stayed here for 6 nights after a week in Santorini. We’ve stayed in many Greek hotels, especially at this price point. Absolut is quite a mixed bag. I can’t say we were entirely happy with our stay. Mind you, we aren’t fussy travelers and are good sports about everything, but this isn’t a 5-star hotel.

The hotel’s proximity to town is unbeatable; just a quick 5 minute downhill walk. The walk back up definitely isn’t for anyone with weak knees. We were totally okay with it, though.

The pool area is okay, with day beds and a surplus of loungers. You can see the sunset from here. I can’t say there is much of an atmosphere. I think it’s why we only spent one afternoon there. It’s relaxing, nonetheless.

Breakfast is included and as stated in other reviews the options are limited. There is a buffet bar with bacon, sausage, cereals, and yogurt, plus a few other little nibbles. The hot foods were always cold and a bit of a turn off. We ordered the continental breakfast which included cake, bread, jams, and butter. It was enough to fill up on even if the cake/breads were sometimes stale. You could also order eggs in 3 different ways but we didn’t find out about add-ons (onions, mushrooms, etc) until our very last morning. An extra charge for a second cup of coffee isn’t a great experience either.

As far as service goes, the front desk was always helpful with calling taxis, laundry, and other requests. A large part of our unhappiness was due to one staff member who seemed bent on making us feel unwelcome. She eventually stopped acknowledging us at breakfast and throughout the day. I’m not sure if we did something to offend her. She even rolled her eyes at the sight of my wife. I just found her attitude unnecessary. We felt quite relieved at her absence during the last two days of our stay. The other team members were nice. We tried to ignore her but it did put a damper on our experience.

We liked the size of our room and the bed itself was very comfortable. There was plenty of lighting and air conditioning, plus outlets everywhere for chargers and whatnot. The bathroom area was a bit cramped but we didn’t mind. The water pressure and temp was great. We got fresh towels every day. Housekeeping was excellent and very friendly! Our little balcony had a great view of the sunset.

Overall, the location is prime and convenient but we wouldn’t stay at Absolut again. Hotels like Rocabella are further from town, but at the same price point, you get more in terms of quality and service.",Date of stay: July 2019,Absolute Mykonos Suites & More,4,"Mykonos, Greece"
Best for Last,"I saved Narcissus for our last dinner in Mykonos. My wife and I couldn’t be more pleased with the food, service, and gorgeous ambiance during sunset.

We decided on the degustation menu for a relaxing, well-paced dinner. Everything was delicious, from the bread and special butters, to the apps and mains.

Vasia (hope I am spelling her name correctly) was very attentive but gave us our space. She always made sure we were happy with the cocktails and food. Really, just look at my pictures. Each bite was scrumptious. The degustation consisted of crab, scallops, your choice or lamb or lobster, and a chocolate tart. They even gave us two lovely glasses of Vinsanto to finish things off.

Can’t recommend highly enough!",Date of visit: July 2019,Narcissus Mykonos Restaurant,4,"Mykonos, Greece"
Yummy & Inexpensive,My wife and I stopped here for lunch after a very long walk. Service was very friendly and the food came out fast. We had pork/chicken gyro platters and tomato keftedes. Everything was wonderful. There’s no reason to not recommend this little spot. They even called us a cab an hour after we left because we couldn’t find one.,Date of visit: July 2019,Happy Grill Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Excellent Food & Perfect Service,"My wife and I had a lovely dinner here earlier tonight. We didn’t have a reservation but we were seated immediately. The staff were very kind and friendly from the beginning of our visit.

Typical bread and olive oil came first, but gosh, it was EXTRA good. Sea bass carpaccio was limey and the spicy shrimps were yummy. We shared the tomato spaghetti and pork filet; both were excellent and the portions were generous. The orange cake was to die for and it was on the house. We finished off with the chocolate molten lava cake; it was rich and divine.

I would highly recommend Nautilus for a fulfilling dinner at excellent price point. The staff are wonderful!",Date of visit: July 2019,Nautilus,4,"Mykonos, Greece"
Our Favorite Day in Mykonos,"Our morning/afternoon out with Captain Nikolas and Artemis is the best memory of our Mykonos trip this summer. They were gracious, generous, and so very kind from the moment we stepped on to their boat.

It was truly a local and traditional experience. It was such a pleasure to be aboard with these amazing gentlemen. Artemis is full of stories and knowledge of the island. Nikolas is a lovely host, offering us coffee first thing in the morning, and a cooler full of beers, sodas, and waters throughout the day.

Artemis showed us how to pull the net in, and so we did! We had plenty of fish which Artemis then cleaned, and Nikolas fried up! We had a super fresh lunch of fish, Greek salad, and rusk. We were stuffed and everything was delicious. Nikolas even rolled me a couple of his cigarettes.

While they cleaned and cooked, we were anchored and allowed to swim, but decided to stay aboard as that was pleasant enough. I can’t stress enough how comfortable we felt with these two lovely individuals. I would highly recommend for a fun, insightful experience you won’t ever forget. I know we’ll always cherish the day we spent with Nikolas and Artemis. It was an honor to experience their day-to-day lives.",Date of experience: July 2019,Captain Nikolas,4,"Mykonos, Greece"
SCRUMPTIOUS!,"I was starving and remembered this place from one of Santorini Dave’s articles so I told my wife we should stop in. I am so happy we did. I cannot praise the food enough!

We had the tomato keftedes, sea bass ceviche, spicy mussels, and spaghetti in veal bolognese. The mussels were soooo good and they were the plumpest I’d ever seen. I could not get enough of the bolognese - it was one of the best pastas I’ve ever had.

The staff are super friendly to top it all off.
I highly recommend this place for a filling meal you won’t forget.",Date of visit: July 2019,Ouzeri,4,"Santorini, Greece"
"Chic, Fresh & Pricey","My wife and I were craving a change in cuisine after many days in Greece so we headed straight for Ginger with two of our friends. We had no reservation but they so kindly seated us right away.

The restaurant design is very chic and I loved the ambiance right away. Service was attentive and kind, as well. We ordered many plates and rolls to share. No doubt about it, everything was as fresh as could be. I did hope for a bit more flavor here and there. My favorite was the snapper carpaccio with truffle. I do think they couldn’t expand the menu a bit, however they have what it takes to cure a hankering for sushi.

Portions were somewhat on the smaller side, especially for the price point. It was not an inexpensive meal and we are used to Santorini/Mykonos prices. We felt satiated by the end of our meal and enjoyed the quality of the food, so no regrets.",Date of visit: July 2019,Ginger Sushi Lounge,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Romantic & Refined,"I had a lovely dinner here with my wife, cousin, and her husband a few nights ago. The food was scrumptious and the service is excellent. Not to mention, the cocktails were stiff and tasty.

I love the ambiance of the dining area set with palm trees and a bit of tropical peace. We loved all of the food, especially the lamb and suckling pig.

I definite recommend Kalita for a romantic dinner, and even one with close friends! The quality of our experience was overall memorable.",Date of visit: July 2019,Kalita,4,"Mykonos, Greece"
Still Amazing,"I returned to JackieO two summers later with my wife, parents, and friends. Everything is just as I remember. Beautiful and attentive staff, lovely water, and delicious food! I dreamt of the the Kalamarada every day until I could return. Everyone in our party had such a nice day. I recommend to everyone who wants a nice beach vibe with lovely people surrounding you. It’s great for everyone - couples, families, friends.

It is €30 per sun bed and water, a glass of welcome Prosecco, and towel are included. There are also charging outlets at each bed. Everything you need is right at your fingertips!",Date of visit: July 2019,Jackie O' Mykonos,4,"Mykonos, Greece"
Family Lunch,"The day before our wedding, my fiancée and I hosted a 55-person family lunch at Aroma Avlis. From the very start, Margarita was communicative and accommodating of the many special requests we had.

When the day finally came, the staff was incredibly attentive to our party. The food was DELICIOUS. Much praise for the lamb stew, spicy pork, and salted figs. The wine always flowed and everyone was very full at the end of our lunch. The lunch area was beautiful and spacious enough for us to take plenty of photos, as well. The wine itself was excellent.

I should also say that for the price point, Aroma Avlis really delivered. Especially in Santorini, it would be difficult to find the same quality of food and service for what we paid. My fiancée and family were so happy with how everything went.

I thank Margarita and the staff at Aroma Avlis so much for treating us well. A big crowd like ours isn’t always easy to manage and we left feeling well taken care of! Best wishes to this lovely restaurant.",Date of visit: July 2019,Aroma Avlis Food & Wine,4,"Santorini, Greece"
AMAZING STAY,"Stayed here with my wife and parents for the 3 nights leading up to our wedding and it was the BEST decision. The hotel was super close to our wedding venue and it was STUNNING.

The pool area was absolutely gorgeous and great to lay out by all day. Our 4-person suite was situated right in front of the main pool (heated btw) and featured 2 hot tubs and its own private lounge area. The staff were super attentive to our daily needs, from drinks, to steaming wedding clothes, and so much more. They truly did everything they could to make our stay perfect.

My mother definitely had a lot of overwhelming demands but the staff never bat an eyelash. Thank you, Chara! We had several guests stop by to visit and the pool/bar staff (especially Chris & Georgia) were so very kind to everyone, constantly bringing drinks and making sure everyone was happy. Breakfast was always a pleasure with high quality choices and filling, at that. Dinner at FlyAway was delicious and the sunset view is impeccable.

I could not be happier with our stay and we definitely recommend it to anyone looking to feel pampered and relaxed. Thank you so much to everyone at West East for giving us an unforgettable few days. You all truly helped keep us calm before our big day. We will never forget it and can’t wait to return! ️️️",Date of stay: July 2019,West East Suites,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Excellent,"And I mean that in every way, from the food itself to the service and ambiance. Ocean Prime has a dining room that’s both cozy and airy, intimately lit but still good for a family dinner.

We had the ocean prime salad, filet mignon, blackened snapper, and a hearty portion of creme brûlée. Everything was so clean and well-cooked. I couldn’t fault them on anything.

Our server checked on us the perfect amount and was discrete during our dinner about his presence but always available when we needed him.",Date of visit: December 2018,Ocean Prime,4,"New York City, New York"

This is a good low-key find for catching up. I came here with my fiancée, my cousin, and his girlfriend. I like the space and the drinks were good but the waitress/server was strange and seemed like she'd rather be anywhere than speaking to us. I can't get over some of the bizarre things she said.

We enjoyed our cocktails but none were all that complex. I loved my Old Fashioned, however. We ordered quite a few bites--deviled eggs, lamb merguez in a blanket, chicken sliders, and one of the flatbreads. Portions were indeed bite sized but the food was decent. I inquired about how many merguez were included in the order and our waitress said, ""Well. I don't know. I've never counted.""

When I asked if a dash of apricot or fruit liqueur could be added to my Old Fashioned, she told me that wasn't possible. Why? I guess I'll never know.

We had a lovely time catching up and the drinks did come out in a timely manner so that was all good. However, I don't foresee us returning thanks to the unwelcoming vibes.",Date of visit: September 2018,Ward III,4,"New York City, New York"
Pre-Dinner Drinks,"Came to this bar for a drink before dinner. My fiancee and I enjoyed our cocktials and played two games of pool before we left. It's very spacious and has a nice vibe with pieces of art for purchase, as well. I believe it is a cash only bar.",Date of visit: November 2017,ÖR Gallery and Tavern,4,"Hudson, New York"
Gorgeous Grounds!,My fiancée and I hiked up to see this beautiful house and we thoroughly enjoyed the abundant foliage and the incredible views all around. We did not stick around to do a house tour but most spots were booked anyway so I would suggest buying tickets beforehand. There is a nice gift shop with great books and art.,Date of experience: November 2017,Olana State Historic Site,4,"Hudson, New York"
IG Drinks + Chic Tiki Vibes,"I came here for the Shark Attack drink which was actually pretty great. I've been here twice and tried a few other cocktails, all of which were strong and tasty. They are a little above typical NYC prices but I enjoy the space even though I never felt like spending more than an hour here.",Date of visit: September 2017,Mother of Pearl,4,"New York City, New York"
Great Restaurant Week Menu,"I don't usually do restaurant week menus but after seeing my friend's post from Amada, I wanted to give it a go. It was absolutely worth it. My girlfriend and I were stuffed when we left and really enjoyed the food. They had a great assortment of tapas – meat, seafood and vegetables, not to mention excellent cocktails.

The decor is quite inviting as well – even in what can be a weird part of downtown. I would definitely return to dine from their regular menu.",Date of visit: August 2017,Amada,4,"New York City, New York"
"Dark, Sexy, Great Drinks!",I had been meaning to check Death & Co. out for years and finally made it over as soon as they opened one night for drinks with two friends. The space itself is quite small but they control the capacity so it never feels crowded. It did get louder as the night progressed but we still felt intimately gathered. The drinks were well made and quite stiff. Their food menu is small and some items are odd (carrot dog?) but most bites we had were good. I would definitely stop by again for drinks.,Date of visit: September 2017,Death & Co,4,"New York City, New York"
Hudson Gem,"My fiancee and I adored our stay at this cozy B&B last weekend. After thoroughly researching all of Hudson's I thought Mount Merino would be perfect – and it was. They accommodated our late check-in and we enjoyed a warm and delicious breakfast the next morning.

The property is vast and the house is amazing. From the gorgeous dining room to our vintage soaking tub and luxurious shower, we couldn't have asked for more. We stayed in the Deer Run room which featured candles, a super cozy bed, decorative fireplace, gorgeous bathroom, and plenty of space for our belongings. We slept very well.

Breakfast happens in the dining room every morning, which is elegantly set and prepared. The kitchen does a divine job with pancakes, eggs, juices and so much more. We also enjoyed having access to tea and coffee in the little kitchen on our floor at any time. That was a nice touch.

The staff is also very kind and willing to help with recommendations for dining, activities and whatever else is on your mind. Rita was so lovely, giving us a trail map so that we could hike up to Olana. It turned out the be a beautiful few hours spent. You can also find a great range of books, movies and board games in the common room if you just feel like kicking it indoors. We got a game of Scrabble in before reluctantly leaving this magical place.

We will definitely be returning to Mount Merino!",Date of stay: November 2017,Mount Merino Manor,4,"Hudson, New York"
"Cozy, Ambient, Great Dishes","After all of the mixed Yelp reviews, I had no idea what to expect from this establishment. It turns out that the food is delicious, the ambiance is great for a romantic date or dinner with friends, and the drinks are stiff!

I am glad we gambled our one night in Hudson on this place for dinner. My fiancee and I shared a few starters – this amazing sesame broccoli dish, excellent snails, and the buttered prawns which were just okay in my opinion (was not a fan of the congee base). Starting off though, it was pretty solid. Next, I had the steak which was perfectly cooked and portioned. I thoroughly enjoyed it all. My fiancee had the rabbit ragout which we also thought highly of. It was a flavorful and tender dish.

We had a couple of cocktails and they warmed us up on a chilly night. We loved the crackling fireplace in the front dining room and felt very satiated upon leaving. I would absolutely recommend and return.",Date of visit: November 2017,Wm. Farmer and Sons,4,"Hudson, New York"
My Favorite Place On Earth,"I have held off on writing this review for a month because I don't want my Aenaon Villas ""high"" to wear off. I can't put into words the magic and beauty of this property, the owners, staff and seamless, family-like service we experienced here.

When I first came across Aenaon in a magazine, I knew there was no other place I wanted to propose to my girlfriend. For almost a year and a half I badgered Alexandra (one of the owners) about booking and setting up something special. She was so patient and generous with her time and advice! By the time we left Aenaon, I was in tears over how wonderfully she and her husband, George, had treated us. They are like far away parents we will always miss and hope to see again soon!

We booked Villa Elidami (private plunge pool included) for our first 3 nights in Santorini and they are days I will never forget. The villa itself was spacious and chic with a huge terrace sporting loungers, a table for dining with chairs, a large umbrella and our sizable plunge pool that proved useful during the heat wave we encountered. It was hard to leave Aenaon every day and we really just wanted to spend all of our time there. Villa Elidami is absolutely worth the splurge.

Each morning, Valentino would bring our breakfast, which was always fresh and delicious. I loved the assortment they offered and especially that chocolate souffle. We started our day off with fresh squeezed orange juice and great coffee! During our stay we also had several other bites, like complimentary fresh fruit, a bottle of wine, and delicious bruschetta and salad. Everything was lovely!

I had a florist set up our terrace with flowers and candles for my proposal, but Alexandra went the extra mile to provide us with bubbly, strawberries, and a generous helping of tiny chocolate souffles! It was a dream come true and I couldn't have done it without her help. My fiancee will never forget that night, and neither will I.

Throughout our stay, taxis were easily taken care of, even when we were somewhere random on the island. Alexandra would have one come pick us up and take us wherever we needed to go.

I could go on and on, but this is a place you need to see for yourself. I cannot wait to return to Aenaon many more times. It was an extraordinary introduction to Santorini. The service we experienced was world-class and Valentino even drove us to our next hotel after check-out, then carried our suitcases on his shoulders through insane Oia!

We love you all and can't thank you enough!",Date of stay: July 2017,Aenaon Villas,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Perfect Oia Location!,"We really enjoyed the two nights spent at Alta Mare. It was a great base for exploring town on foot while maintaining good proximity from the real crowds. The front desk and overall staff were such a pleasure to speak and interact with!

We stayed in a Romance Suite and it was incredibly spacious. Our bed was cozy, we had a very large bathroom, and a huge walk in closet space! Our small terrace was perfect for looking out over the caldera with a dining table and two loungers, plus our amazing hot tub that I used both days!

Breakfast was an incredible affair with so many delicious choices! We filled up on healthy and yummy treats to start each day. They also sent a welcome bottle of wine and fresh fruits to our suite the second day since we spent the first on a sailing excursion.

I arranged a romantic turn down service on our last night with candles, truffles and rose petals. When we arrived at our suite after dinner, it was a lovely sight!

I would definitely recommend Alta Mare to anyone looking for wonderful service, spacious accommodations, and lovely views of the caldera and white houses! We had drinks by the lounge and pool area but never swam there, but it was beautiful anyway!

The front desk also arranged a taxi to the port for our ferry to Mykonos and gave us recommendations of restaurants on the island!",Date of stay: July 2017,Alta Mare By Andronis,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Perfect Last Dinner!,"I saved the best for last when it came to dinners in Santorini. We very much looked forward to Lauda and happened to be staying at Alta Mare right next door so it was a breezy walk over.

Let me start off by saying, the food was so good, I ordered my entree TWICE. YES, TWICE. They must have thought I was crazy but I have no regrets! It was equally amazing both times!

All of the food was incredible and the cocktails were amazing. Service was top notch as we expected it would be. The amuse bouche was quite good even though I'm not the biggest fan of melon. The breads and various dips were also lovely. We had great fish, the beef in vinsanto was to die for, and the tuna tartar was lovely. We were stuffed at the end of meal but soooooo happy.

It was the perfect last meal in Santorini and as romantic as could be. I can't wait to return to Lauda in the future! Keep it up, you guys.",Date of visit: July 2017,Lauda Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"
William Vale's Redeemer!,"My fiancée and I had a super mediocre stay at the William Vale a few weekends ago but we are so happy we decided to lunch at Leuca before our departure!

I will ignore the fact that upon asking for a table for 2 we were told they had nothing and the main dining room was mostly empty but for two tables of diners. At that point in our stay I expected the nonsense to keep coming our way.

We took a seat at the bar and everything was amazing from then on. Our incredible bartender sure knew how to make a stiff drink and he was really friendly! Not to mention, knowledgeable about their wines and capable of answering our questions.

We ordered the tuna as a starter and the pasta with calamari to share. Both were SO GOOD! We wanted to order them again, right away. Overall, we were really surprised at how delicious and perfect everything turned out to be. We can't wait to come back for a proper dinner!",Date of visit: July 2017,Leuca,4,"Brooklyn, New York"
Gorgeous Rooftop & Amenities,"This spanking new hotel was perfect for our one night stay in Athens. Located in a central spot, it's in very close proximity to the Plaka, Acropolis, and tons of museums. Our classic room was more than spacious with a generously sized bathroom as well.

We went up to the rooftop our first night to lay by the loungers and were really impressed with the gorgeous view of the Acropolis all lit up. When we returned the next morning for breakfast it was an equally stunning sight.

Breakfast seemed a bit understaffed but that wasn't a problem since it is a self-serve buffet for the most part. The selection is quite lovely, with yogurt, fruits, meats, eggs, waffles, pancakes and so much more. We only needed a server for coffee and someone eventually came around.

Overall I was satisfied with our stay and would definitely recommend it as a base in Athens!",Date of stay: July 2017,Electra Metropolis Hotel,4,"Athens, Greece"
Amazing Drinks!,"We went to check out the colorful wall of bottles and I was almost immediately put out at the sight of a packed bar. Just when I thought we wouldn't be able to have drinks, the owner appeared and showed us right to a pull-out table! We were so happy. I then had one of the best drinks of my whole life. I can't remember the name but it had hazelnut liquer and was to die for!! This is definitely a place I recommend for a couple pre or post dinner drinks. They have a very interesting menu and lovely bartenders!",Date of experience: July 2017,Brettos Bar,4,"Athens, Greece"
Great Food & Staff!,"We were the first couple to show up for dinner on a blazing hot night just weeks ago. I was very much looking forward to our meal after reading all of the reviews of this place.

The view of Skaros Rock and general location of Athenian House are superb! Can't beat that view. I'll keep it short and say that everything we ate was delicious. The moussaka is the best I've ever had! I really loved the giant oxtail ravioli as well!

This is the place for a romantic fine dining meal and is totally worth the splurge if you only have one night to do it. We also ate at La Maison and liked Athenian House better even if it was pricier.",Date of visit: July 2017,The Athenian House,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Gyros are bomb!!!,"I don't know how you can beat Lucky's in terms of value for taste and quality. It was a bit packed when we went around 2pm but that was to be expected. We got our food in about 15/20 minutes and paid €5 for two huge gyros.

We tried to eat them slowly and couldn't even stop from shoving them down our throats. So fresh, so clean, so good!!",Date of visit: July 2017,Lucky's Souvlakis,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Unbeatable Charm,"Movies are my favorite pastime and this is hands down the best place to watch any film. I wish this was my living room.

I can't describe how cute this theater is. We visited on a lovely night, got drinks at the bar, and settled into two perfect seats. Unfortunately the show of the week was Baywatch but I didn't care because the chill, romantic ambiance was all we needed.

Drinks were really good and there was never a line for the bathroom. We did arrive shortly after the ticket office opened and had no problem getting tickets. I will say that all seats were filled by the time the movie actually started though.

4 Star Design | 3 Star Service,"My girlfriend booked this hotel for my birthday weekend and upon arrival we were upgraded to a Gotham King room. That was a nice touch but that's where the standout aspects of our stay ended.

Our room had a very comfortable bed and nice balcony, as all the rooms do, and the view is quite lovely even if there's construction below on the Brooklyn side. The bathroom shower pressure was great and it was spacious enough overall. The hotel is very modern inside and out.

We spent a couple hours at their nicely sized pool surrounded by loungers. I had two good cocktails but found one of the servers to be rather unfriendly and uninterested unless you were a large group of girls. When we returned from a show we saw later at night, the woman at the front desk simply looked up and ignored our hello.

After staying at many incredible hotels in this city and around the world, I can say the staff here leave a lot to be desired. It was really the only thing that made us feel like we wouldn't stay here again.

We ordered room service 3 times and ate lunch at Leuca, which I HIGHLY recommend. Such a wonderful restaurant with excellent food and great bartenders! When we checked out, a very kind woman told us we could leave our bags there and hang out at the pool, and we did enjoy that very much.

Overall, our stay was okay.",Date of stay: July 2017,The William Vale,4,"Brooklyn, New York"
Chic + Peaceful,"Like other reviews have mentioned, the standout aspect of this divine property that's only a few minutes drive from Mykonos Town, is the incredibly welcoming and helpful staff. I can't say enough about how well taken care of my fiancee and I felt.

Our room was spaciously sized with a generous patio. I used the hot tub (perfect temperature) every single night. Housekeeping stopped by twice a day, once while we were at breakfast and later in the afternoon. They kept our room super tidy and we especially loved the amazing aromatherapy candles at night. We looked forward to coming home every night for whatever treat would be left out – cake, pudding, etc.

We were absolutely spoiled by breakfast which included a cake/bakery basket, coffees, fresh juice, a ridiculously well stocked yogurt bar with toppings, meats and fruits. We also ordered eggs and some other things on the menu. Everything was always super fresh and delicious. We started the day off feeling well fed and energized.

Having an hourly shuttle to town was extremely convenient and we were also arranged transfers to the airport, port and other areas of the island we wanted to explore. Both of Rocabella's drivers made us feel super safe and the ever friendly George told us everything we needed to know about the island. We loved chatting with any of the staff.

We only spent one early afternoon at the pool but managed to try several drinks at the bar – all of them were delicious.

Rocabella is the perfect stay for anyone who craves a stylish, intimate retreat. They really go above and beyond to make your stay as perfect as possible. We look forward to staying here again when in Mykonos!",Date of stay: July 2017,Rocabella Mykonos Hotel,4,"Mykonos, Greece"
Wonderful Day!,"Super Paradise beach was much more low key than I imagined after reading all of these reviews. My fiancee and I had a truly relaxing day on this beautiful beach. We loved the incredibly kind and attentive staff!

We were probably the first ones there at about 10:30 am and promptly shown to our sunbeds. They were real comfortable and we were welcomed with two glasses of prosecco and a huge bottle of water to keep us hydrated throughout the day. As the day went on, we had several rounds of drinks and a delicious lunch. The spicy pasta and seared tuna were sooooo good.

The beach itself is beautiful and there is a huge pool by the bar you can also swim in. I would definitely recommend to anyone for a good day of sand service and views of beautiful blue. We later saw the infamous Priscilla and had a good time dancing by the pool at night.",Date of visit: July 2017,Jackie O' Mykonos,4,"Mykonos, Greece"
4.5 Stars!,"Came here for our anniversary dinner and it was also our first night in Santorini. We were lucky enough to secure two front row seats a month beforehand but there isn't a bad view from this restaurant. It is pretty small and has spectacular views of Imerovigli and the caldera.

Service was kind and wonderful. The food came out fast and we liked all of our dishes. The scallops with parsnip purée was perfect, my fiancée's sea bass was delicious, and my filet of beef was cooked very well! For a fine dining restaurant, I thought the portions were just right. We both also enjoyed two lovely cocktails.

I would recommend for a nice romantic dinner to anyone.",Date of visit: July 2017,La Maison,4,"Santorini, Greece"
"Beautiful, Delicious, Friendly!","My fiancée and I went here for dinner earlier today and it was our favorite meal experience in Santorini so far! After reading all of these reviews I knew we had to book a table.

We arrived at 4pm for an early dinner and it was rather empty on the terrace since Santorini is currently experiencing a heatwave. We decided to sit outside anyway since the views are incredible!

We ended up having the rocket salad which was soooooo very refreshing and tasty, the octopus with fava, mussels in white wine, and lamb in yoghurt sauce! All of the above were hearty, flavorful and so delicious. Their portions are generously sized and the staff were so very good to us. They gave us two complimentary desserts of blackberry cheesecake and orange chocolate cake. I can't say enough about how nice they were! They called us a cab at the end of dinner, as well.

Complimentary bread, olives, cheese, and ouzo included, our entire bill was only €45! I would recommend Metaxy to ANYONE, and could probably eat here every day.",Date of visit: July 2017,Metaxy Mas,4,"Santorini, Greece"
View = 5 | Wine = 3,"Although I read that the wines here were quite average, I couldn't resist the sunset pictures and view at Santo. We booked a front row table months in advance and I would advise anyone to do so since the place was entirely booked tonight.

The panoramic view from Santo Winery is AMAZING. It is truly a beautiful place for sunset watching or hanging out during the day. Staff were very kind, as well. My fiancée and I shared the 18 flight taster accompanied by a pamphlet explaining each wine. Surprisingly, we did not enjoy the more aged wines but all in all, the experience was worth it. The taster spans from dry whites to dry reds and dessert wines. It included several glasses of Assyrtiko and Vinsanto.

They have a store out front where I purchased a bottle of rosé. It has plenty of snacks and foods, as well. I would definitely recommend it for a sunset view experience but to not expect the best of wines.",Date of experience: July 2017,Santo Winery,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Delicious & Special,"Had such a great dinner here! We were given a lovely table for two and decided on the 4-course menu. Food was absolutely wonderful; the hamachi Mille-feuille was to die for, the eel carbonara was unique, and the Berkshire pork dish was bursting with color and flavor! Portions were quite generous for a fine dining establishment and drinks were solid. The ambiance here is unpretentious and laid back. They brought a special toffee dessert out for my girlfriend's birthday and it was delicious. We took the additional petit fours and chocolates to go. We will definitely be back for lunch or dinner sometime!",Date of visit: May 2017,Gabriel Kreuther,4,"New York City, New York"
Great Birthday Dinner,"Decided on Daniel for my girlfriend's birthday dinner and it was an excellent choice. Service was impeccable from start to finish; it was probably the best I've experienced anywhere. We opted for the 4-course menu and went through 3 cocktails each.

The white cosmo with orchid ice ball is truly beautiful. It was refreshing! Next we both had the ""Tableside"" duo of cocktails mixed literally tableside. This was a really interesting and pleasing combination of spirits and tastes.

The amuses were beet centric and since my girlfriend loves beets I was very happy about that. The bread offerings were also delicious; we had the warm brioche, and garlic rounds.

I had the rabbit, escargot, and wagyu, all of which were delicious but particularly the beef. I savored every bite. My girlfriend had the frog legs and it was a generously sized portion packed with flavor I'll never forget. I wish I could have ordered an additional plate of this for myself!

Our dessert choices were yummy, followed by warm madeleines, petit fours, small chocolates, and the kiwi dessert as a birthday treat for my girlfriend!

We were perfectly full by the end of it all and not a bit overstuffed.

I was surprised to find the ambiance rather relaxed and not at all stuffy. We felt well taken care of by our extremely kind and attentive servers.

We will be back many times, for sure.",Date of visit: May 2017,Daniel,4,"New York City, New York"

Excellent Drinks + Romantic Ambiance,"I came across this freshly opened bar and decided to bring a friend here for birthday drinks. Needless to say, I will be back tomorrow night with my girlfriend.

I absolutely loved everything about this joint. From the friendly service that starts at the door, to the sophisticated drinks and perfect bites, they nailed it. There was live jazz in session when we were seated around 5:30, the band took a break at some point for about an hour, then they were back to play later.

I had the run with smoked applewood which was delicious and great on the nose. I also two other cocktails that I really loved. Bartender definitely knows what they're doing. I think their menu is currently limited due to a wait on their gas situation but everything we had was delicious. The tuna sashimi was fresh and tasty, the buratta with blood oranges and pomegranates hit the spot, and the charcuterie board was quality!

Although we sat immediately to the stage's left, I could still hear my friend through the music and we had a great time conversing for almost 3.5 hours. I can't wait to make this a regular spot.",Date of visit: March 2017,Fine and Rare,4,"New York City, New York"
Great Margaritas!,"We decided on this lounge for our friend's surprise engagement party. They were very accommodating of our cake and balloons. Because of their happy hour all night long, none of our tabs were unbearable and the drinks were pretty good, especially the frozen mango margarita. The space, couches and decor is chic and romantic.

The cons? The place is really dark and doesn't have much of an ambiance but we were a big crowd so that didn't matter. The music is terrible and one of the bartenders was not very friendly, but the rest of the staff was great.",Date of experience: March 2017,La Biblioteca de Tequila,4,"New York City, New York"
Incredible Valentine's Day Dinner!,"I knew this place would not disappoint after reading all of the glowing reviews. It was a fantastic choice for this special night and I hope to return for many dinners!

The team at L'appart is simply outstanding. They are a seamlessly charming bunch offering warmth and great hospitality. Amidst the napkin folding and chair holding, we felt very relaxed and free to be at ease. Chef Nico came around to each table and even signed our menu as a special memento. One of the servers noticed how much I loved the sage butter and she constantly replenished my supply!

I lost track of what we ate so I can't even recall everything. The tasting started with a few small bites, then 4 amuse bouches; beet (so earthy), mackerel (in a beautiful parsley sauce), guinea hen (with shiitake), and chestnut (with truffle, Greek yogurt, and crispy potato strips on top). Everything was great but the chestnut amuse was to die for! I couldn't get enough of this decadence. We were also gifted yummy caviar blinis with creme fraiche.

I can't remember the bread that was served but it came with salted house butter and a sage butter that rocked my world. The sage butter paired with honeycomb blew my mind. Our server brought out 3 servings of butter and honeycomb since she noticed my obvious love.

Our mains finally hit the table starting with garlic saffron oysters. I enjoyed the brine and saffron combination very much. Next, we had the lobster with avocado and ginseng. This was my girlfriend's favorite main as it reminded us of a dish we had in Amsterdam. Chunks of lobster were placed on top of a tangy avocado mousse and topped with crisp tapioca. The presentation and texture was perfection, and I had never seen tapioca done this way. The sea bass that followed kept up with the surprises. A celery cream and foam greatly complemented the clean, tender bass and star anise. Our last main was quail stuffed with foie gras, accompanied by Asian pear and Swiss chard. The meat was so juicy and tender while the skin managed a beautiful crispness! I enjoyed every bite of this dish.

Our first dessert course was overwhelmingly sensory (in a good way). The lychee, rose, and vanilla flavors came together in a captivating way that made my taste buds tingle, bite after bite. Next we had a ganache type chocolate truffle paired with a ginger sorbet and cara cara orange. This was rich and refreshing all at once!
We were stuffed silly at this point but out came small offerings of rice pudding with crisp, airy cookies for dipping. Cups of chai came next with petit fours that I somehow managed to devour. I couldn't bear to leave anything on my plate!

I am so disappointed in myself for not making L'appart a priority sooner but am glad we enjoyed this special night here. I hope to return many times to try their ever changing menu and experience the coziness of this intimate dining room. While it is not an inexpensive dinner, the ambiance and food are worth every penny. I was even pleased to see that they comped us two glasses of wine and a glass of champagne. I wish nothing but good things for this amazing team and will see them again soon!",Date of visit: February 2017,L'Appart,4,"New York City, New York"
"Delicious, Dark, Loud","I have been wanting to try this place for a while mainly due to the incredibly romantic decor and abundance of candles! I brought a friend here for her birthday dinner and we were both really happy with our experience.

We had a 5:30 reservation and by 6:30/7 the place was jam packed. I'm not sure if it's because our table was right on the outskirts of the bar but it became incredibly loud. Clearly people love to come here.

As I waited for my friend I had a drink at the the bar with whiskey and blood orange. It was perfect and strong. Once she arrived we were seated right away. We ordered shishito peppers to start and the infamous brick chicken for 2. Our server brought out two delicious pieces of bread with choice butter and an amuse bouche of everything bagel with cream cheese on top of chicken soup. The tiny bagel bite was incredible. Our shishito peppers were good and the chicken came out quickly. People, it was enormous and it was SO GOOD. I honestly think 3-4 people could share this dish if accompanied by another plate or two. The potatoes were soft and flavorful, the chicken was tender and succulent. The buttery pan dripping was sooo scrumptious I poured it all over my plate. Not sure why some reviews say the chicken is dry or flavorless. This so was not the case.

For dessert, we had the smores 2.0 which consisted of marshmallow ice cream, two toasted marshmallows, and a light mousse cake thing layered with graham cracker, chocolate and marshmallow fluff. After that, we were brought two small, moist, buttery cookies.

Overall, we were stuffed and happy and loved the ambiance. I would definitely return to try more of the menu and for that chicken!",Date of visit: February 2017,Marc Forgione,4,"New York City, New York"
Amazing Fish Tacos!,"We actually regret not having tasted more of their menu during our trip. This was a great place for breakfast on our last day and for casual lunch bites throughout our stay.

Shallow and Calm,"We left Grace Bay to explore other beaches for a day. Our taxi driver had a little difficulty finding the beach since you have to wind through some villas and houses being constructed. It is just past Sapodilla Bay. The day was rather cloudy and windy so we didn't enjoy the water as much but it was still beautiful and so shallow, we walked out hundreds of feet and were still submerged below the hips. It's a great beach for kids and small children. There is no shade and no amenities are offered on this small stretch of beach. Bring your own gear, water and snacks. Whenever the sun did shine, the water was magnificently clear and beautiful. It's definitely worth checking out for a little.",Date of experience: January 2017,Taylor Bay Beach,4,Providenciales
An Incredible Sight!,"The ethereal colors of Chalk Sound must be seen with eyes because pictures cannot do them justice. The chalky, electric blue of this water is unreal. I am glad we ventured out to Las Brisas for lunch, which offers a dining terrace that looks out upon the Sound. From here you have a panoramic view of water that we saw people walk several hundred feet out into, submerged only up to their knees. Definitely worth visiting this great place. The restaurant also rents kayaks out but we didn't have a chance to use them.",Date of experience: January 2017,Chalk Sound,4,Providenciales
Tasty Dishes & Lovely Staff,"My girlfriend and I have been here 3 times now. There is a rather peaceful ambiance in this place and the staff is kind and welcoming. They really want you to enjoy your meal.

Over the course of our visits we've tried quite a few things. Yak is their speciality and they serve it in many different ways. We have tried their yak momos and found them to be just okay. I much prefer the beef ones. Yak meat is far too lean and tough for me. The sauce served with the momos are really good, especially the green one!

Today we tried their sliced and grilled wild boar. Tasted and looked a lot like bacon but half of it is pure fat and a little inedible. It was seasoned quite well though. I ordered goat curry which came with buckwheat roti, achar, potatoes, and vegetable curry. I've had this twice and like it very much.

It's not an expensive place to dine and the food is flavorful and filling. It is a pleasure to come here every few months. Two mains, an appetizer, momos, and 3 cocktails came out to $85 without tip.",Date of visit: January 2017,Himalayan Yak Restaurant,4,"New York City, New York"
More Than 5 Stars!,"Good heavens, I have been waiting for the perfect time to write this review! My girlfriend and I visited Providenciales a few days after Christmas, up until the New Year. Months before, after reading stellar reviews of Coco Bistro, I made reservations here for our first and last night in Turks. Just from the cute photos I knew it would be something to love.

Suffice to say, we wish we had dined here all 4 nights of our trip. I cannot praise the warm staff, friendly bartenders, keen servers, and delicious food enough. The setting itself made us incredibly happy. Tables are romantically nestled amongst palm trees and free snuggles are welcome from Coco the cat.

We had several cocktails at the bar and at our table, all of which were good. You can't really go wrong with anything here. The first night, we had Conch 2 Ways and both had the Pepper Crusted Tuna as mains. Loved the succulent conch ceviche and the tuna was incredible. The quality of food here is evident. Our dishes were obviously fresh, well seasoned, and perfectly cooked. The servings were not small either.

The second night we had the tuna tartare appetizer which was delicious and I had the lamb as a main. I loved this lamb dish! The flavors were powerful and the meat was juicy and tender. Once again, great portion size. We tried their famous coconut pie and it was a scrumptious, not too heavy end to a perfect meal. Another point: the kitchen definitely knows how to plate a meal.

Each dinner here cost us about $200 with appetizer, mains, drinks, and dessert. It is not an inexpensive dinner but it is definitely more than what you will get at places like Coyaba where the food and ambiance pales in comparison. It is worth every penny. I am so thrilled to have celebrated New Year's Eve and my anniversary here. We will absolutely be returning to Turks, possibly just for Coco Bistro.",Date of visit: January 2017,Coco Bistro,4,Providenciales
Beautiful Blues!,"The colors of Grace Bay are unbelievable when at their best. It is an explicable bright blue that I couldn't tear my eyes away from. This beach is endless and we never found it to be crowded. Water was a bit rough but swimmable. I wouldn't think it's the safest for kids but everyone seemed to be enjoying the surf. I have heard that the water can be like that during the winter months. On the contrary, friends have mentioned it begin completely flat and clear in the summer months! Plenty of resorts have chairs but there is also lots of room to spread out in a towel if you please.",Date of experience: January 2017,Grace Bay Beach,4,Providenciales
No better lunch view exists!,"After a few hours at Taylor Beach, we took a walk to Las Brisas because I refused to leave without seeing Chalk Sound with my own eyes. As per usual, pictures alone cannot do this place justice. We didn't make reservations and the restaurant was able to accommodate us for lunch with literally the best seat in the house. The view is utterly jaw dropping! We had a couple of drinks, everything on the cocktail list sounded great and ours definitely hit the spot. My girlfriend and I split the cracked conch, she had fish tacos, and I had calamari. Everything was delicious! I am so happy we came here. It can be a little on the pricey side but that view is worth every penny.",Date of visit: January 2017,Las Brisas Restaurant,4,Providenciales
Amazing Staff & Grounds - Dated Rooms,"My girlfriend and I stayed at OCE for 4 nights leading up to NYE. Staying on the island is incredibly expensive at this time of year and this accommodation was the least expensive option we found. I was a little apprehensive because it is an older resort and not in the center of Grace Bay. This turned out to be perfect for us.

There is no ""bad"" location on Grace Bay and we easily found loungers on the beach. The free shuttle between OCE and OCW was heavily utilized by us at least twice a day and extremely convenient when we needed to visit restaurants for dinner and stock up at the grocery store.

There are two pools at this resort and we liked them both. One is closer to the beach and one was right outside our building. The staff were friendly and helpful with each encounter. The bar staff was great and the restaurant and front desk were amazing. We were always greeted with smiles and conversation by our shuttle drivers as well. We felt welcomed and liked.

The grill and bar by the beach served up awesome food at decent prices. We loved their conch fritters and breakfast was perfect on our last day. Service on the beach from bar staff was excellent as well. The best part of staying here was the next-door closeness to the NYE beach bonfire at Ricky Flamingo's! We couldn't have picked a better place to stay for this occasion. We watched the fireworks go off right behind OCE.

Our room was a Studio in the Gardenia building. It was a good size overall with a cramped kitchen. We enjoyed the little balcony with coffee and cards but it obviously hadn't been cleaned or wiped down in ages. The room itself didn't seem the cleanest and it was showing wear and tear but we didn't mind. We didn't spend much time in it anyway. For the value, we got what we expected and maybe a little more.",Date of stay: January 2017,Ocean Club Resort,4,Providenciales
Fun for Groups – Great Food & Service!,"Our group of 5 was seated upon arrival at around 6:30. We got the furthest back table which was a little cramped but it was cozy so that's okay.

We tried a bunch of things off the menu, from sushi and small plates to larger ones. Everything was good and some things were excellent! We loved the Golden, Godzilla, and Astroboy rolls a lot. Nice sized pieces with tons of tasty fish and dressing. The purple sweet potato fries were BOMB. You have to get those (we had two baskets). The short rib was tender and tasty, the bacon wrapped asparagus was great and the bacon wrapped mochi was just okay. We shared the smoked bacon Okonomiyaki and the flavors were so pleasantly surprising. This was definitely a favorite. Lastly, we shared a tuna poke bowl with godzilla sauce – this was enormous and so good!

Every morsel of food was really fresh and dishes were brought out very fast. All of our servers were extremely friendly and pleasant.

I would definitely come back here. They had a great sake list, as well!",Date of visit: December 2016,Izakaya NoMad,4,"New York City, New York"
Overpriced; Wouldn't Return,"Let's start with the good. We were welcomed right away and shown our table which was further back in a really beautiful area. I love the decor of this restaurant, it is very festive and romantic.

We ordered drinks; Dark and Stormy for me, Lychee Mojito for my date. Mine was good, hers not so much. We decided to share the Danish baby back ribs and a side of truffle fries to start. Both of these were great and I loved the guava ketchup! For mains, we had the Tuna Loin and Shrimp Fettuccini. We felt that they were both very small and completely unsatisfying. At almost $40 a plate I was expecting more than just a few Alfredo noodles and maybe 4 shrimp. Both of the dishes were tasty, we just wished there was more. We had one amuse bouche of gazpacho and a completely liquified passion fruit sorbet. There was no point to the latter. After our mains, I ordered the Bao Buns because I was still hungry. The two small buns were tasty and meaty but once again, very small.

We skipped dessert, feeling a bit frustrated and wishing we'd gone elsewhere. We also ate at Seven and the portions there (and at Coco Bistro) were twice as large at the same price.

Our bill with tip and tax came out to $220 while we left feeling hungry and underwhelmed. It's nice to try everything once but I'm afraid we don't feel that a return visit is necessary.",Date of visit: December 2016,Coyaba Restaurant,4,Providenciales
Great Food,"My girlfriend and I dined here earlier tonight. Although we love Coco Bistro more, we couldn't fault the food or service at Seven. The setting is quite romantic at Seven even if there are many large families and children dining. I actually love how accommodating they are of all parties.

They started us off with a sushi amuse bouche and bread/crackers with butter, tapenade, and one more thing I'm forgetting. All of it was lovely.

We had the duo of yellowfin tuna to start and loved it. Thinly sliced sashimi lay on top of a tartare bed. We had a palate cleanser before our mains. I had the osso buco which was hearty and very saucy. My girlfriend had the snapper and thought it was very good although a little over cooked. For dessert we shared the mango creme brulee and it totally hit the spot. We left feeling well satiated and all for $150, tip and tax included.

I had two seven & sevens during dinner. The only miss was that it took almost 20 minutes to bring one out. Not a terribly big deal to me. Staff was really friendly and did everything they could for your happiness.",Date of visit: December 2016,Seven,4,Providenciales
Just avoid!,Had some time before the theater for dinner and figured this would be good since it's one of the few non-chains or celeb restaurants in Times Square. Halfway through this meal I wish we had gone to Red Lobster. Service was very nice and the restaurant is a good size but the food was so very bad and a waste of money. My girlfriend ordered beets which looked and tasted like they came right out of a can. We decided to split the lamb gyro which had a wet hair on the plate beneath the meat which tasted bleh to begin with. I had the galaktoboureko for dessert and was pretty disappointed by that as well. I would definitely not return and head to 9th ave for a better bite at half the price.,Date of visit: December 2016,Dafni Greek Taverna,4,"New York City, New York"
Dope Gatsby Room,"I was dying to come here and we decided to put names down as we had time to kill before a birthday. 40 mins later we got a table in the Gatsby room which I loved!! The drinks were good, the decor is fab, and the service is attentive. I ordered some food which took forever and that's the only reason for docking them one star. It must have taken half an hour for my croque monsieur and some nuts. They could have just brought the nuts out for us to snack on until the food came. Oh well. I'd still return.",Date of visit: December 2016,Dear Irving,4,"New York City, New York"
Great ambiance/unenjoyable food.,"Four of us came here for Saturday brunch and I picked it for the cute patio in the back. The ambiance is great and the place is nice but the quality of food was totally lacking.

My girlfriend and I both got the rustica frittatas and they really weren't good. Something was super off about the taste and I couldn't eat more than half. The Nutella focaccia was also really underwhelming. My friends said their pancakes were good, though. I will say the drinks were excellent event though our server seemed really confused and slow about our orders.

Group Birthday Brunch,"Came here last weekend for a friend's birthday. We were a group of 7 and it turned out to be a perfect brunch for us. Not crowded, a nice space and friendly service.

We all did the brunch special that came with mimosas and a comp appetizer. I loved the appetizer trio and pita. Additional mimosas were only $5 so that was a plus. They mixed up something so everyone got their meals correctly but mine was wrong. I got my food last as everyone finished up but they left the incorrect order for my table anyway and that was nice.

The food itself was pretty good and the staff is friendly and accommodating. It's a great place for Mediterranean and probably perfect for a date night.",Date of visit: November 2016,Zizi Limona,4,"Brooklyn, New York"
3.5 Stars,"Came here after Shibui Spa with my girlfriend without reservations and we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, even during prime dinner time – 7:30.

We were starving and into a carb overload so thought we ought to try this place after hearing so much about it over the years. The decor is warm and stylish with lots of wine bottles and brick. It's definitely nice for a fall/winter meal.

We grabbed two glasses of wine at the bar where we were taken care of quickly. We were seated at the front of the restaurant about 10 minutes later and after being poured water, our server remained out of sight for about 15-20 minutes. She came over to take our orders and apologized for the delay. She was very friendly and the restaurant was packed so we understood that everyone was busy.

The comp mushroom bread didn't even arrive until after our Crab Crostini but both were good. I thought two pieces of crostini was absurd however. My girlfriend got the Paccheri with pulled pork and I got Grandma's Ravioli. Both were delicious but the portions were quite small. The raviolis were little and the amount of filling inside even tinier. The filling itself was made of short rib and other ingredients which resulted in a rich foie gras-like taste. It was delicious! Both of our pastas were cooked very al dente which I'm also not a big fan of.

What really made our meal was the amazing Robiola Cheesecake! The pumpkin spice-esque cheesecake was so richly divine and paired with pear sorbetto, lambrusco granita, walnuts and sauteed pears. I couldn't get enough of this. It was perfectly balanced and not a single bite was overpoweringly sweet.

All in all, we had a decent meal but I don't think I'd return unless it was to try their brunch menu. It's above average but nothing to write home about.",Date of visit: November 2016,Locanda Verde,4,"New York City, New York"
Excellent massage - but something is missing.,"My girlfriend and I went to Shibui Spa yesterday for Elemental Well-Being massages and overall I felt pretty satisfied with our experience.

We were greeted and shown the locker room which was surprisingly small but featured a cool steam shower and lots of beauty necessities like razors, lotions, and whatnot. The locker opened up to a robe, rubber slippers, and stretchy paper thongs if one felt so inclined.

We filled out the clipboards and headed to the pool area where our masseuses were waiting. The pool area is really beautiful but we didn't have the time to use it. I would suggest coming earlier if you want to use it. The girls led us back toward the entrance and down to the (dark) massage room. Our elemental soak was already set up and they left us be for about 10 minutes. It was fragrant, hot, and romantic. Two glasses of ginger and yuzu juice were at our availability, along with water.

Our massages followed next and my masseuse seemed to know exactly what my body needed without my words. She seemed to have more than two hands. She got the knots out of my back, massaged my head, and eased the soreness of my feet which I've been feeling for months.

They also used a dry brush which felt interesting but wasn't completely unpleasant. We were actually given two of these at the end of our treatment. After that, we relaxed by the pool with some tea.

The treatments were good and the ambiance is beautiful - but I think there's something missing. It is not an inexpensive experience and I was a little irked by the lazy pool attendee. I'm not sure what his purpose even was. For the price you pay here I just expect a little something more.",Date of experience: November 2016,Shibui Spa,4,"New York City, New York"
Beautiful Autumn,"Came here for an early dinner at 6 with my girlfriend and it took about an hour for the restaurant to fill up! The fall decor is truly stunning and they really nailed the ambiance. It's definitely date material.

First the bad, since there isn't too much of it. We both ordered the Road to Jericho cocktails which were gorgeously presented and then over in about 2.5 light sips. What on earth? Mind you, those sips were a little gross. It was bad and at $16 each somethings gotta give. We stuck with wine for the rest of the night. We both had glasses of Pinot Noir after that at $20 a pop. It was just okay.

On to the food! Our server brought out pumpkin bread with maple butter - omg freakin divine! We got another round of that. We ordered the smoked hamachi and fig carpaccio - both of which were really good. The carpaccio might be too sweet for some people but it was nicely balanced by the cheese and almonds. My main was the Long Island duck with grapefruit and fig. I really liked this dish. The duck was cooked well and I found it moderately portioned. My girlfriend said her branzino was okay. For dessert, we both had giant helpings of panna cotta with grilled peaches and raspberry gelee. I was stuffed at the end of it all!

Service was very good. Our table was rocking back and forth and it did it go unnoticed by one of the servers who immediately came over and fixed it! I would definitely love to come back to try a different season.",Date of visit: November 2016,Park Avenue Autumn/Winter/Spring/Summer,4,"New York City, New York"
Nice for catching up!,"This is a nice casual spot for drinks. I've been for brunch too, and that was good! The drinks were good and we shared a couple of things on the menu. Pork belly deviled eggs were amazing, truffle mac and cheese was amazing, chicken empanadas were good! It's a very intimate setting so I loved that. Prices are in the middle, leaning towards expensive.",Date of visit: October 2016,Hill & Dale,4,"New York City, New York"
Good food & great ambiance!,Came here on a pouring night after a friend's book reading. My friend and I were in the mood for burgers so figured this would be a great spot. It was packed when we arrived and waited about 15 mins for a table. The ambiance was lovely. My friend got the veal burger with fried egg while I had the W & L burger. Everything was delicious and service was great. It was the perfect place for a cozy dinner on a rainy night.,Date of visit: October 2016,Wolf & Lamb Steakhouse,4,"New York City, New York"
Great service!,"On a horrible, rainy Halloween weekend packed with tourists, it was nearly impossible to find a place to eat. I'm really giving this place 4 stars for being huge with the space to accommodate plenty and for the truly efficient staff who make it work smoothly! It was really busy around 4pm but our orders were taken quickly and the food came out not too long after. However, they never rushed us!

I had steak tips and mashed potatoes which was hearty and just what I needed. My girlfriend had two bowls of the clam chowder and we shared some really excellent tuna tartare! Loved the mango and guacamole salsa that came under the tuna. We both had drinks as well. Everything came out to about $70.",Date of visit: November 2016,Finz Seafood & Grill,4,"Salem, Massachusetts"
Great spot to fill up!,"We were very short on time before our flight back home and decided to eat here after scarfing down $36 of supremely small lobster rolls. Service was fast and friendly, my favorite kind. We ordered the two kinds of buns, edamame, shrimp lollipop and pork gyoza. Everything was good! Would definitely hit up any of these if in a rush.",Date of visit: November 2016,Wagamama,4,"Boston, Massachusetts"
Delicious!,"My girlfriend had been dying to take me here for years so we finally went. I hear the Astoria location is better but this review is objective of that. We showed up around 6:20 and were seated immediately. They don't take reservations and the restaurant was full about ten minutes later so be mindful of peak hours.

Everything we ate was wonderful. The spinach pie was good, the calamari was perfectly fried and my lamb chomps were incredible. What really blew my mind was the galaktoboureko. Holy $@&!, that stuff is so good!! I would come back just for that free slice they serve at the end of your meal.

We both tried Greek wines and ended up liking them a lot. Overall, I would definitely recommend for anyone who not just likes Greek food, but likes clean, hearty, home-cooked meals.",Date of visit: November 2016,Taverna Kyclades East Village,4,"New York City, New York"
Cold buns!,"It was already cold outside (where we ended up eating) so I thought toasted lobster rolls would be a great idea. However, we got two cold buns filled with cold lobster meat (which was real good) but just not filling! They didn't hit the spot and were average priced I suppose.",Date of visit: November 2016,Boston and Maine Fish Co.,4,"Boston, Massachusetts"
Gorgeous garden even in bad weather!,"We were hard-pressed for time and only bought tickets to see the garden, plus Nathaniel Hawthorne's birthplace and some other tidbits. You can really feel the history and the garden is gorgeous. I could have spent ages in the gift shop. They have some very cool merch. The museum is set on the water so there are great views as well.",Date of experience: November 2016,The House of the Seven Gables,4,"Salem, Massachusetts"
Just wasn't for us.,I'm sure others on our tour loved it but I found the whole thing rather uninteresting. I barely learned anything about Salem and the stories told by our guide were really about himself and he seemed out to prove his super naturalness. It was corny and the medium readings he did at the end just seemed... like a load of crock.,Date of experience: November 2016,Sinister Stories of Salem,4,"Salem, Massachusetts"
Plenty to see!,"I really hate crowded areas like this but for what it is, it's an excellent marketplace. There are plenty of options when it comes to food and shopping, but barely any indoor seating. If you snag some good eats you will probably end up having them outside. I wish I had more time to check out the various vendors but I did manage to scarf down a good lobster roll.",Date of experience: November 2016,Quincy Market,4,"Boston, Massachusetts"
Cool place.,"Stopped in for a drink with some friends on Halloween weekend. Wasn't too packed and we easily found a table. I imagine it's a great place to hang out at during the summer months. Had a pretty good beer, too!",,Notch Brewery & Tap Room,4,"Salem, Massachusetts"
Lots to see - interesting.,It was packed and we didn't get to see much but there was definitely plenty to do. There are tons of shops worth exploring and so much witchcraft merch you could explode. Definitely a must see if you're interested in this kind of stuff. There were plenty of signs for palm and tarot card readings. Plenty of food and drink vendors as well. Worth checking out.,Date of experience: November 2016,Salem Witch Village,4,"Salem, Massachusetts"
"Peaceful, green recluse.","I don't suppose many people know about this little conservatory. It's sort of in the middle of no where but really lovely inside.

We took a nice walk throughout for about 20 minutes.",Date of experience: November 2016,Allan Gardens Conservatory,4,"Toronto, Canada"
Waldorf Chicken Salad!,"Leo's is the only good bagel place is this neck of the woods. I have been there once and ordered from them today. The first time around, I had an everything with scallion cream cheese and it was bomb. Today I was in the mood for chicken salad which is weird and rare but I digress. I ordered the waldorf chicken salad on white bread and holy $&%@. It is amazing!!! I am writing this review in between halves of the sandwich. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is also delicious. I dock Leo's one star only because it is a little pricey.",Date of visit: October 2016,Leo's Bagels,4,"New York City, New York"
A cozy gem!,"When I came across pics of this place I knew it would be perfect for the cozy fall dinner we wanted on a random Friday night. It's walking distance from my job and right by the water. I absolutely love the ambiance of this space from the minute you walk in. The staff is really friendly and they are good at their jobs.

We got a cozy table in the room that's behind the bar. There are a couple of booths and nice tables. The front was packed and there was a private party near us but the attention we got never wavered. The guy who owns the place took care of our orders and drinks all night. He was really nice and welcoming. We were never without drinks or water.

We shared the meat board and both got burgers, plus some cocktails. Everything was good. Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The drinks were also super delicious and strong. We finished off with a scrumptious pumpkin creme brûlée. We felt so great that it was really hard to leave! Rest assured we will definitely be coming back for dinner. I would totally come just for drinks, as well.",Date of visit: October 2016,Trading Post,4,"New York City, New York"
Quick stop.,"Had a pint of pumpkin ale and it was good. Hanging out in the back would be fun with a good group of people. You can drink at a table, listen to some live music and just look out at the beautiful vineyard. It's worth a quick stop if you have some time. The place only had one female toilet working and that totally needs to get fixed. I thought the staff were a little unfriendly but that didn't ruin anything.",Date of experience: October 2016,Duck Walk Vineyards,4,"Water Mill, New York"
Cute and cozy - average food.,"Randomly drove into town with my parents and girlfriend. We were starving and this was the first place in sight. The outdoor area was pretty cozy on this rainy day and service was prompt. We ordered the calamari and buratta to start; both were good. Calamari could have been better. Then we got our mains, short rib, chicken, branzino and papardelle. The short rib and potato purée were hearty and well flavored. Parents seemed satisfied with theirs but my girlfriend's papardelle wasn't the best. Pasta was thin and the sauce was a little watery. That could have been a lot better. Our server was really great though and he gladly packed us extra bread which my dad loved. The manager came around twice to ask how things were, too!",Date of visit: October 2016,Logan Inn,4,"New Hope, Pennsylvania"

Best of Stone!,"This place to me, is the only bar on Stone Street that serves as an intimate, cute, and potentially romantic venue. I've been here tons of times with coworkers for goodbye shindigs and then with friends for catchup drinks. They have a lovely menu, great staff, and good food. We've actually had a party in the basement before and it was superbly catered with open bar and delicious bites.

Wanted to love it.,"I was a little disappointed by the food at Mombar and this is what brings my rating down. I love the decor, the family style setting, and the lovely man that owns and runs this restaurant. Service is a 5 for sure. He is very welcoming and his sons take care in serving you. We came for a friend's birthday (group of 8) and ordered a bunch of apps then mains. The dips and beets were good but not much else stood out. I was really excited to try the rabbit course I ordered as a main but it was severely underwhelming. I found most of the meat to be undercooked, stringy and from inedible parts of the animal. The sauce was also a tad bit slimy which was kind of off-putting. For a one man show I think the owner and chef does such a great job but some of the dishes just fall flat. I don't think I would come again.",Date of visit: June 2016,Mombar,4,"Astoria, New York"
A summer beauty!,"I have been here in both winter and summer and much preferred the latter. We got there early enough after work to snatch a table and the place was already packed but not to the exhaustive point as many other rooftop bars. I absolutely adore the space and ambiance of Gallow Green. It is a stunning setting for drinks with friends. That being said, the specials are usually in the $18-20 range but what the hell, it's where we live. It's definitely worth checking out and the staff is pretty great!",Date of visit: September 2016,Gallow Green,4,"New York City, New York"
Check it off the list!,The costumes and actors in this production do truly magnificent things to bring this story to their audience. I thought Aladdin was a whole lot more captivating but that probably had to do with the proximity of our seating. The Lion King is definitely a must see on Broadway. It's enjoyable for everyone of all ages.,Date of experience: April 2016,The Lion King,4,"New York City, New York"

Great flavors + flowers :),The draw to this place is the super cute flowers they make out of your ice cream. Very instagrammable stuff people. Okay well the flavors and the gelato itself is pretty amazing. I tried 3 flavors and they were all amazing. I wish we had eaten more.,Date of visit: July 2016,Amorino,4,"Paris, France"
UES location is nicer!,"As expected, the food at Boqueria was great but seating felt cramped. The layout of the UES restaurant is a little better. We did the brunch feast – got the patatas bravas, tomato rubbed bread, ham and mushroom croquettes, omelette, french toast, eggs benedict, and churros to end it all. Food was pretty good, drinks flowed well and the service was nice. Mind you it does get loud and it's good for a group catch up, but not if you're looking for a more quiet, intimate setting.",Date of visit: September 2016,Boqueria,4,"New York City, New York"
Amazing drinks + brunch!,"Made reservations for a noon brunch (party of 2) but my friend was running late and when I called, they gladly pushed our reservation to 12:30. As I was waiting for her, I ordered a blood orange sangria at the bar and it was divine! New favorite brunch drink.

My friend finally arrived and the sat us right away at a good sized table for two. The place wasn't crazy packed yet but it eventually was about an hour later. We shared the tomato rubbed toast which was good and I got the eggs benedict. My main was real good. I have only had better eggs benedict at one place in my life at that was at Clinton St. Baking Co. But these reminded me of that dish and were strong competition. We also shared the patatas bravas which were to die for. I would come back just for these potatoes. Of course we dessert, we got the chocolate filled churros and they were yummy. Overall, it was a filling, tasty brunch!

Unfortunately I did not get to do the brunch feast but I am returning this weekend so I can cross that off the list and try more of the menu.",Date of visit: September 2016,Boqueria,4,"New York City, New York"
Adore this bar - amazing painkillers!,"This is one of the cutest, most chill bars I've ever been to in this city. Met up with a bunch of coworkers for an engagement celebration and it was perfect. We snagged the big table at the front and liquored up with happy hour specials. The painkillers are amazing and no establishment in the Northeast has managed to make a decent one until now. It's a nautically themed bar and it totally pulls it off. Nothing tacky about the decor and the bartenders are nice and attentive! Where do you even get that anymore?! Love this place!",Date of visit: September 2016,The Folly,4,"New York City, New York"
"New, nice kid on the block!",This place just opened up recently and it was already packed by 5:30 on a Thursday. I guess what else do you expect of the work crowd in FIDI. Our group of 4 grabbed a table on the main floor by the bar and our server quickly took orders. We had our drinks arrive in about 5 minutes and my food came out maybe 15 later! Both were lovely. Service is friendly and attentive so we were really pleased. The burger I had was delicious! Definitely a new go-to for drinks and catching up after work.,Date of visit: September 2016,Broadstone Bar & Kitchen,4,"New York City, New York"
Surprisingly wonderful!,"For some reason I've always pegged this restaurant as touristy, overpriced and probably pretentious - but it was NONE of these things!

It was quite a local crowd and even though we didn't have reservations we only waited 20 minutes for a table overlooking the water. I really have to give the 5 stars to this restaurant's ambiance. It turned out to be quite romantic and really relaxing after an hour of boating on the lake.

Portions were plentiful, the food was good (not creative, but fresh, hearty, and tasty), and the price not bad at all for NYC. My striped sea bass was super filling and my girlfriend took home half of her seared ahi tuna. We split the butterscotch bread pudding which was sooo delicious!

It was pretty busy since we dined during peak dinner hours but service was the perfect amount of attentive and friendly, too! I think it will be a place we actually try to dine at, at least once a summer from now on.",Date of visit: August 2016,Loeb Boathouse Central Park,4,"New York City, New York"
Very meh brunch.,Cute place with very nice service but the food really fell flat. I ordered the breakfast casserole which had way too much zucchini and the potatoes really looked and tasted like bread crumbs. My girlfriend had the Caprese Frittata and it was too oily so she only ate half. They gave us these mini banana muffins to start and those were good. I wouldn't come back for brunch. Maybe dinner is better?,Date of visit: September 2016,Brownstone Bistro,4,"Toronto, Canada"
Perfect!,"I'm glad this is the one winery we chose to visit during our one day visit to Niagara. We paid $5 CAD for the Private VIP tour which really involved about 40 other people but that was fine. It's a pretty short tour with explanations of the grounds and processes once the grapes are collected. It was pretty cool that they house the oldest barrel in North America (89 years old)! The tour ended with a tasting of 4 wines - Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Riesling, Merlot, and their famous Peach Wine, all of which were delicious but especially the latter. The bottles are super cheap in the on-site store where you can also pay for more tastings if you so desire. We ended up buying 5 bottles, including an ice wine, all for $75 CAD. What a gem of a place! I would definitely come back.",Date of experience: September 2016,Konzelmann Estate Winery,4,"Niagara-on-the-Lake, Canada"
Hits all the marks!,Lee can do no wrong. The place was buzzing for dinner around 8 and we were happy to be there. The staff was super friendly and our server Maria took care of us well. The food was amazing and super fresh! We over ordered a bit because we didn't think the Singaporean Slaw was going to be so filling. That dish on its own is incredible with 19 ingredients plus the salmon sashimi we added to it. Next I had the braised beef which was delicious and heart. My girlfriends satay assortment was very flavorful and she enjoyed them. If I lived in Toronto I would come here all the time.,Date of visit: September 2016,Lee Restaurant,4,"Toronto, Canada"
Cool & crowded.,This is definitely the best aquarium I've ever been to but it was super packed and full of screaming kids. I love the slow conveyer belt that takes you through the shark and sting ray tunnel. We definitely saw a lot of fish and jellyfish! It's nice to do once. Worth a visit.,Date of experience: September 2016,Ripley's Aquarium of Canada,4,"Toronto, Canada"
Great brunch!,Came here for brunch on a Sunday when it was packed and super busy! They have several floors of seating though and we got a table in 5 minutes. We both got the peameal eggs Benedict and they were perfectly filling. Our coffee mugs were always full and service was friendly. Would and probably will come back!,Date of visit: September 2016,Smith,4,"Toronto, Canada"
Great drinks & ambiance + perfect for lunch!,"This was such a perfect spot for lunch. The patio is huge with eclectic decor and lovely ambiance. We were seated almost immediately upon arriving around one.

Our server was real friendly and she was quick to bring drinks we ordered. They were absolutely delicious. Go for the blackberry margarita if you like either of those things!

My girlfriend and I did the lunch special which is soup or salad with two tacos of your choice. She had salad with the pulled pork tacos while I had tortilla soup with Baja fish tacos. Portions were perfectly sized and it hit the spot. The battered cod was generous and the soup was sort of heavy so I felt pretty satiated. I wouldn't say the food is anything out of this world but it was fresh and tasty. We found our bill to be quite reasonable.

I would definitely come back for drinks and to try some of their other dishes!",Date of visit: September 2016,El Catrin,4,"Toronto, Canada"
Wonderful food & service!,"The staff here are so friendly! We came around 5 for dinner and it was already filling up. They couldn't find our reservation but had no trouble getting us a table right away.

Somehow they really manage to make even Pad Thai taste better than most if not all places. The Khao Soi was also super delicious. Be careful about the highest level of spicy because it really is hot AF. I could handle it but others may not be able to.

Overall, we had a satisfying dinner and I even took the rest of the Pad Thai home to devour later! The only miss was the pitcher of sangria we ordered. For 30 CAD it's just a pitcher of really tasty juice with no hint of alcohol. Maybe we just had a weak batch? Who knows?

I'd come again to try more of the food and drinks! They had a plum wine Moscow mule that's been on my mind and I totally regret not ordering it!",Date of visit: September 2016,Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,4,"Toronto, Canada"
Ideal!,"This is what you imagine when you imagine afternoon tea. Excellent service, nice sandwiches and really wonderful cups of tea. I went with my girlfriend, mom and aunt and we're glad we chose The Savoy. The staff was perfectly attentive without being overbearing and they were great to chat with about the teas or anything else. I found it to be a lot less stuffy than I imagined it would be, so that's a big plus. I really liked the coronation chicken sandwiches and dessert pastries!",Date of visit: July 2016,Thames Foyer at The Savoy,4,"London, United Kingdom"
"Great drinks, food, & service!","Came here for dinner with my cousin from Austin, her husband, baby and my girlfriend. Everyone working here is super friendly and very accommodating!

The space itself is cute and cozy. The food was good but they unfortunately ran out of the lobster corn dogs before we got there! I like my lobster roll nonetheless and they were very generous with it; no skimping on the meat! Everyone else's food seemed to please, as well. We had a few painkillers and they were delicious! How can you go wrong with $5 dollar frozens during happy hour!? You can't!

Music was a little loud for 6pm but I'm not really complaining about that. It's a great place to catch up for sure.",Date of visit: August 2016,Sea Wolf,4,"Brooklyn, New York"
Bomb!,"I have been meaning to try this place for weeks and finally ordered lunch today on UberEATS. I got the small chicken kothu which was delivered piping hot! I have great tolerance for heat and I loved the level of spice this kothu had. It was chewy, savory, meaty, full of vegetables, and just amazing! This is definitely going to be something I crave all the time. For $10 bucks you can't go wrong. I'm excited to try the beef and prawn kothus as well.",Date of visit: August 2016,Kottu House,4,"New York Mills, New York"
Best takeout Thai in FIDI!,Obao is really great for lunch. It's my favorite option that's in walking distance from my building. They have a pretty standard menu and everything is fresh and delicious. I would say they're reasonably priced as well! Lines get really long at lunch but they prepare orders quickly. I usually go right before 12 or after 1:30 to miss the crowd. Love the chicken and shrimp dumplings. The pad kee mao is delicious!,Date of visit: August 2016,Obao,4,"New York City, New York"
Birthday Dinner!,"I thought my cousin would like a trendy spot for her 18th birthday dinner so this seemed like some place I could finally cross off my list.

We had a reservation for 6 and they seated us promptly. The dining room started filling up within the next hour and it's moderately loud and dark, but not too dark in my opinion. It would definitely be a good date place since they have several booths available.

Between 3 of us we shared quite a few dishes. The quesadilla rustico was eh but I'm not a big fan of flatbread to begin with and that's what this is more like. I loved the oxtail empanadas and the chips & guac were quality. Then we shared the Peking duck tacos and soft shell crab tacos. I preferred the soft shell crab ones but both were good. I do think they're a little ridiculously priced at $10 each. Next we had the banana leaf snapper and carne asada. Both of these were good but nothing mind blowing. I wasn't the biggest fan of their mole sauce but the meat was nice and tender.

As for drinks, I was quite pleased with my prickly pear Paloma! My girlfriend had some watermelon spice cocktail that tasted excellent as well.

For dessert we got the Don Huevo because how could we not? I actually really loved this. Presentation was lovely and it made my cousin happy. It's very small once the chocolate ball melts but incredibly rich. Each of us could only handle a few bites anyway. It was perfect!

As for service, couldn't fault our guy in any way. He was super friendly, great to recommend things, and our drinks/food came out with great timing! Everyone that works here seems pretty cool.",Date of visit: August 2016,Bodega Negra,4,"New York City, New York"
Good for group brunches!,"I'd really rate this a 3.5 since I consider the food a little better than average, but the service and refilling speed bump that up a little!

I think if I lived closer to Williamsburg I would probably come here more. I've been once for dinner and maybe 3 times for brunch. They have a pre-fixe brunch menu that's about $35 and totally worth it. They refill your drinks so fast and we usually over drink and overeat since the portions are generous, as well!

It's a cool place to catch up with friends and the food is good. Not mind blowing, but it's hearty. You will be stuffed after this meal, guaranteed.",Date of visit: August 2016,Viva Toro,4,"Brooklyn, New York"
Great brunch!,"This is definitely one of the better bottomless brunch places in NYC. The staff is really nice, they refill you well and the food is delicious! Really can't go wrong with coming here. The best thing is that it isn't crazy loud like some other places and you can hear each other without yelling. Excellent for group catch ups and birthday brunches!",Date of visit: May 2016,Yerba Buena Perry,4,"New York City, New York"
Food = Solid 3.5,"Upland could be great if they worked a bit on the food. One can't deny its incredible ambiance and beautiful interiors. Service was very good and I really liked our server.

We ordered two specialty cocktails and they both arrived 5 mins later. Can't complain about either of them!

On paper the menu sounds great but not all of the dishes translate so well onto a plate. For starters we had the Seared Octopus and Burratta. Both were good, the octopus a little too salty, but in each case I've had better. Let me not forget to mention the loaf of bread we were given beforehand - it was so soft and delicious! I wish we had accepted the second loaf in retrospect.

Then we decided to share the Pork Ragu Papardelle which was good but also a little too salty, and the Long Island Duck which was nicely cooked and seasoned. The duck plate was much larger than we anticipated and I ended up taking a third of it home. Their portions are more than substantial for 2 people sharing. They didn't skimp on the meat in either dish and that was appreciated, unlike in many restaurants.

Finally, we ended with the berry and champagne gelee dessert which was recommended by our server. This basically turned out to be a pan full of blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries with spoonfuls of champagne gelee and several merengue chips sprinkled throughout. To be honest, I was really underwhelmed by this dessert even though the berries were fresh.

I don't need complex layerings of flavor in every dish to enjoy a meal but I do think that simple dishes should be mastered when they're incorporated in a menu, especially with the way they are priced at Upland.

I probably won't go back for dinner but it was a nice experience nonetheless.",Date of visit: August 2016,Upland,4,"New York City, New York"
Summer Friday drinks!,"Great place for drinks in the early afternoon. I can imagine this place gets packed after 5 so I'm glad we made it here around 1 pm. I came with a bunch of coworkers and we were surprised at how much smaller it was than the frying pan. Due to size it's definitely a lot rockier and I wouldn't recommend it if you get easily sea sick. Drinks are expensive but average for chilling on a boat bar in this city. However, they are delicious!",Date of visit: July 2016,Grand Banks,4,"New York City, New York"

Gorgeous; everything I imagined!,We took the train from Paris to Vernon and biked the trail to Giverny. This was a great way to enjoy a bit of countryside on the way to Monet's Gardens. It was a glorious day and I would definitely recommend buying tickets before to skip the line. We got there pretty early but there were already plenty of people. The gardens were absolutely beautiful and his home is rather well preserved. Visiting this magical place is one of my favorite memories ever. I would do it again and again! You can view many of his paintings in the house itself and explore tons of neat memorabilia in the gift shop if you fancy.,Date of experience: July 2016,Fondation Claude Monet,4,"Giverny, France"
A favorite!,This is a favorite park of my girlfriend and I. Probably one of our favorites in the world. The gardens are so beautiful and we loved watching the tiny sailboats on the water. It's a great place to relax in or walk around. Love the amazing palm trees that fit right in for some strange reason. I could spend a whole day here doing nothing! It's a shame we didn't spend enough time here on our last trip.,Date of experience: July 2016,Luxembourg Gardens,4,"Paris, France"
Everything Ispahan!,"God I love this place. I stopped by to pick up some Ispahan croissants for breakfast, and plus a passion fruit cream cheese one. Of course, they were both delicious. We also tried the Ispahan macarons which were divine. Always worth a trip, especially when there's no line!! Service is super friendly, as well.",Date of visit: July 2016,Pierre Hermé Bonaparte,4,"Paris, France"
Solid food!,I usually go to Patron for good Mexican in Hell's Kitchen but it was raining and we were starving right outside this place. Food was BETTER than average and actually pretty darn good. We got a pitcher of sangria that was just okay. Service is really friendly and they're good at taking care of you.,Date of visit: July 2016,Arriba Arriba Mexican Restaurant,4,"New York City, New York"
GEM of Paris!,"This has the be the best Thai in Paris. After a week of eating Dutch/French for every meal we really started to crave Asian. Knowing how hard that is to find in Paris when it comes to quality and taste without a large tab at the end, this place was a killer find. It is a very cute restaurant and even has a separate entrance for takeout orders. We stopped by the day before to make reservations for dinner and they were very accommodating. I would recommend reserving since it is cozy and seating is limited. Service was very friendly and the food is incredibly fresh and delicious. Best Tom Kha soup I've ever had in my life! Usually this isn't even something I care to order. Next I had the green curry and that was amazing as well. I will say prices are a bit higher than usual. I noticed a staple like Pad Thai would run you 16€ while in New York it's half that! Needless to say, it's worth it for the quality of dining and impeccable service. I will definitely be returning!",Date of visit: July 2016,Thai Spices,4,"Paris, France"
Incredible!!!,"Our dinner here was so amazing that we're going back tomorrow. The concept of a surprise menu is great and even though we opted for the 3 course menu, they served up about 4 amuse bouches in between. Service was friendly and the food, omg, it was so delicious. They really nail it when it comes to presentation, taste and creativity. You can taste the quality in every single morsel and at the end we just wanted to repeat our meal again. Not to mention the value is unbeatable.",Date of visit: July 2016,Senses Restaurant,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Spacious rooms + nice pool!,"I suppose this hotel is on the trendier side of things and we had zero complaints about our night stay here. I really liked how private and serene the backyard was. The pool was such a plus and we managed to make time for a dip, as well as some time in the sauna. Our Deluxe Balcony room was quite large and looked out into the gardens and courtyard below. The location was perfect; a quick 5 minute walk to Ghent'c city center and many of the main attractions. Staff was nice and got us a cab to the train station.",Date of stay: July 2016,Pillows Grand Boutique Hotel Reylof,4,"Ghent, Belgium"
Great drinks & ambiance + perfect for lunch!,"This was such a perfect spot for lunch. The patio is huge with eclectic decor and lovely ambiance. We were seated almost immediately upon arriving around one.

Our server was real friendly and she was quick to bring drinks we ordered. They were absolutely delicious. Go for the blackberry margarita if you like either of those things!

My girlfriend and I did the lunch special which is soup or salad with two tacos of your choice. She had salad with the pulled pork tacos while I had tortilla soup with Baja fish tacos. Portions were perfectly sized and it hit the spot. The battered cod was generous and the soup was sort of heavy so I felt pretty satiated. I wouldn't say the food is anything out of this world but it was fresh and tasty. We found our bill to be quite reasonable.

I would definitely come back for drinks and to try some of their other dishes!",Date of visit: September 2016,El Catrin,4,"Toronto, Canada"
Wonderful food & service!,"The staff here are so friendly! We came around 5 for dinner and it was already filling up. They couldn't find our reservation but had no trouble getting us a table right away.

Somehow they really manage to make even Pad Thai taste better than most if not all places. The Khao Soi was also super delicious. Be careful about the highest level of spicy because it really is hot AF. I could handle it but others may not be able to.

Overall, we had a satisfying dinner and I even took the rest of the Pad Thai home to devour later! The only miss was the pitcher of sangria we ordered. For 30 CAD it's just a pitcher of really tasty juice with no hint of alcohol. Maybe we just had a weak batch? Who knows?

I'd come again to try more of the food and drinks! They had a plum wine Moscow mule that's been on my mind and I totally regret not ordering it!",Date of visit: September 2016,Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,4,"Toronto, Canada"
Ideal!,"This is what you imagine when you imagine afternoon tea. Excellent service, nice sandwiches and really wonderful cups of tea. I went with my girlfriend, mom and aunt and we're glad we chose The Savoy. The staff was perfectly attentive without being overbearing and they were great to chat with about the teas or anything else. I found it to be a lot less stuffy than I imagined it would be, so that's a big plus. I really liked the coronation chicken sandwiches and dessert pastries!",Date of visit: July 2016,Thames Foyer at The Savoy,4,"London, United Kingdom"
"Great drinks, food, & service!","Came here for dinner with my cousin from Austin, her husband, baby and my girlfriend. Everyone working here is super friendly and very accommodating!

The space itself is cute and cozy. The food was good but they unfortunately ran out of the lobster corn dogs before we got there! I like my lobster roll nonetheless and they were very generous with it; no skimping on the meat! Everyone else's food seemed to please, as well. We had a few painkillers and they were delicious! How can you go wrong with $5 dollar frozens during happy hour!? You can't!

Music was a little loud for 6pm but I'm not really complaining about that. It's a great place to catch up for sure.",Date of visit: August 2016,Sea Wolf,4,"Brooklyn, New York"
Bomb!,"I have been meaning to try this place for weeks and finally ordered lunch today on UberEATS. I got the small chicken kothu which was delivered piping hot! I have great tolerance for heat and I loved the level of spice this kothu had. It was chewy, savory, meaty, full of vegetables, and just amazing! This is definitely going to be something I crave all the time. For $10 bucks you can't go wrong. I'm excited to try the beef and prawn kothus as well.",Date of visit: August 2016,Kottu House,4,"New York Mills, New York"
Best takeout Thai in FIDI!,Obao is really great for lunch. It's my favorite option that's in walking distance from my building. They have a pretty standard menu and everything is fresh and delicious. I would say they're reasonably priced as well! Lines get really long at lunch but they prepare orders quickly. I usually go right before 12 or after 1:30 to miss the crowd. Love the chicken and shrimp dumplings. The pad kee mao is delicious!,Date of visit: August 2016,Obao,4,"New York City, New York"
Birthday Dinner!,"I thought my cousin would like a trendy spot for her 18th birthday dinner so this seemed like some place I could finally cross off my list.

We had a reservation for 6 and they seated us promptly. The dining room started filling up within the next hour and it's moderately loud and dark, but not too dark in my opinion. It would definitely be a good date place since they have several booths available.

Between 3 of us we shared quite a few dishes. The quesadilla rustico was eh but I'm not a big fan of flatbread to begin with and that's what this is more like. I loved the oxtail empanadas and the chips & guac were quality. Then we shared the Peking duck tacos and soft shell crab tacos. I preferred the soft shell crab ones but both were good. I do think they're a little ridiculously priced at $10 each. Next we had the banana leaf snapper and carne asada. Both of these were good but nothing mind blowing. I wasn't the biggest fan of their mole sauce but the meat was nice and tender.

As for drinks, I was quite pleased with my prickly pear Paloma! My girlfriend had some watermelon spice cocktail that tasted excellent as well.

For dessert we got the Don Huevo because how could we not? I actually really loved this. Presentation was lovely and it made my cousin happy. It's very small once the chocolate ball melts but incredibly rich. Each of us could only handle a few bites anyway. It was perfect!

As for service, couldn't fault our guy in any way. He was super friendly, great to recommend things, and our drinks/food came out with great timing! Everyone that works here seems pretty cool.",Date of visit: August 2016,Bodega Negra,4,"New York City, New York"
Good for group brunches!,"I'd really rate this a 3.5 since I consider the food a little better than average, but the service and refilling speed bump that up a little!

I think if I lived closer to Williamsburg I would probably come here more. I've been once for dinner and maybe 3 times for brunch. They have a pre-fixe brunch menu that's about $35 and totally worth it. They refill your drinks so fast and we usually over drink and overeat since the portions are generous, as well!

It's a cool place to catch up with friends and the food is good. Not mind blowing, but it's hearty. You will be stuffed after this meal, guaranteed.",Date of visit: August 2016,Viva Toro,4,"Brooklyn, New York"
Great brunch!,"This is definitely one of the better bottomless brunch places in NYC. The staff is really nice, they refill you well and the food is delicious! Really can't go wrong with coming here. The best thing is that it isn't crazy loud like some other places and you can hear each other without yelling. Excellent for group catch ups and birthday brunches!",Date of visit: May 2016,Yerba Buena Perry,4,"New York City, New York"
Food = Solid 3.5,"Upland could be great if they worked a bit on the food. One can't deny its incredible ambiance and beautiful interiors. Service was very good and I really liked our server.

We ordered two specialty cocktails and they both arrived 5 mins later. Can't complain about either of them!

On paper the menu sounds great but not all of the dishes translate so well onto a plate. For starters we had the Seared Octopus and Burratta. Both were good, the octopus a little too salty, but in each case I've had better. Let me not forget to mention the loaf of bread we were given beforehand - it was so soft and delicious! I wish we had accepted the second loaf in retrospect.

Then we decided to share the Pork Ragu Papardelle which was good but also a little too salty, and the Long Island Duck which was nicely cooked and seasoned. The duck plate was much larger than we anticipated and I ended up taking a third of it home. Their portions are more than substantial for 2 people sharing. They didn't skimp on the meat in either dish and that was appreciated, unlike in many restaurants.

Finally, we ended with the berry and champagne gelee dessert which was recommended by our server. This basically turned out to be a pan full of blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries with spoonfuls of champagne gelee and several merengue chips sprinkled throughout. To be honest, I was really underwhelmed by this dessert even though the berries were fresh.

I don't need complex layerings of flavor in every dish to enjoy a meal but I do think that simple dishes should be mastered when they're incorporated in a menu, especially with the way they are priced at Upland.

I probably won't go back for dinner but it was a nice experience nonetheless.",Date of visit: August 2016,Upland,4,"New York City, New York"
Summer Friday drinks!,"Great place for drinks in the early afternoon. I can imagine this place gets packed after 5 so I'm glad we made it here around 1 pm. I came with a bunch of coworkers and we were surprised at how much smaller it was than the frying pan. Due to size it's definitely a lot rockier and I wouldn't recommend it if you get easily sea sick. Drinks are expensive but average for chilling on a boat bar in this city. However, they are delicious!",Date of visit: July 2016,Grand Banks,4,"New York City, New York"

It was a glorious day and I would definitely recommend buying tickets before to skip the line. We got there pretty early but there were already plenty of people. The gardens were absolutely beautiful and his home is rather well preserved. Visiting this magical place is one of my favorite memories ever. I would do it again and again!

Overpriced + bad food + mediocre service!,"I'll start off by saying that I had some of the best meals in my life, in Amsterdam. The night after this, we had our favorite dinner ever at Senses for more courses, more creativity and total deliciousness – for less money! I originally wanted to try this place out because the garden at the back looked amazing. Upon arrival we were told we couldn't sit there since there wasn't enough staff working. There were about 8 other people in the restaurant dining upstairs, where we ended up sitting. I did like the dark color schemes and quirky choice of decor.

From the very beginning I felt the lackluster quality of service which carried on throughout the evening. I felt they were either slow or just didn't care.

On to the food. Octopus carpaccio to start was the only good thing we had. It was very good! For my main I decided to try to suckling pig and found most of the dish to be rather disgusting and inedible. No flavor, chewy and uncooked pork, just bad. I know that we had dessert but honestly can't even remember what it was due to how disappointing everything turned out.

I think this place has much potential but they really need to work on the attitude and general quality of food. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",Date of visit: July 2016,Lion Noir,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Always good for brunch!,"A good friend from out of town came to surprise me for a weekend so I thought this would be the perfect trendy NYC brunch for her. I always love the food and the bottomless brunch is one of the best. Service once seated was really good and they refill your glasses without missing a beat.

However, even with reservations, we waited about 20 minutes to be seated and had to really push for a table. I'm sure if we hadn't mentioned it we would have waited longer. We were seated at the back which definitely had no AC running and it is HOT in July people. The one thing I hated most was the over-aggressive d-bag bouncer at the door. Really? A bouncer? For brunch? Stupid. He basically behaved the way all uptight psycho doormen do in NYC, but homeboy this is not a club and Kim K. isn't sitting inside. So, get over yourself.",Date of visit: July 2016,AGAVE,4,"New York City, New York"
Great for a special night!,"My girlfriend took me to dinner for my birthday and this had been on my list for a while! I am a big fan of French cuisine and decor so she knew what she was doing. I totally love the dining room and how cozy it is. Even the bathroom is to die for. I had one of the cocktails and an interesting glass of red, both of which were amazing. We opted for the 3-course dinner menu and felt great at the end. Satiated but not stuffed. I also love that they have a bread cart with amazing selections. I really loved the apricot bread and a gluten/flour free white that I tried. My girlfriend's rabbit salad melted in your mouth and I can say the same about everything I had. The blue fin was amazing and so was the steak. For dessert I had the Myrtille, a light and delicious blueberry concoction inside white chocolate. They also brought out the Baba Rhum with happy birthday written at the same time! They also brought out 10 petit squares to choose from. Before we left they gave us lemon loaf cake for breakfast!Service was quite good and they were happy to answer any questions; never intrusive.",Date of visit: July 2016,Bouley Restaurant,4,"New York City, New York"
Unforgettable! ❤️,"I would give Kamer01 a thousand stars if I could. We stayed in the blue room for 3 nights and are certain that we wouldn't have loved Amsterdam as much if we hadn't chosen this place. Peter and Wolter are the most amazing hosts with immaculate attention to the detail. Their thoughtfulness was unreal and taste in design was impeccable. We really loved the cozy round bed, sleek bathroom and gorgeous breakfasts by the window overlooking the Singel canal. Each night I over indulged in wasabi peanuts left out for us, along with other snacks, wine, beer and water. It was a pleasure to return each night after a long day of exploring. Peter and Wolter are so very kind and we miss them already. There's no place I'd rather stay in Amsterdam and we can't wait to return one day! The location of their house is also perfect for exploring the city on foot, is close to all forms of transportation and really great restaurants, plus the amazing Van Stapele cookie shop. They took care of calling us a taxi to the station and even sent me off with a bag of those wasabi peanuts I couldn't get enough of. Stay here if you can.

The menu is tapas styled so we got a few things to share as well as mimosas and raspberry Bellinis. Everything was amazing. We had papardelle with crab/tomato sauce, a divine salad, pork cheek with elderflower, and the amazing guacamole. It all tasted very fresh and clean. We left feeling just the right kind of full.

The weaponry rooms also held a vast number of gorgeous pieces from Asia and the Ottoman Empire, plus full suits of armory from Europe and India.

The inside of the castle is simply beautiful and I wasn't expecting to find so much fine art. The drawing room alone held 3 Van Dyks! Every room had super knowledgable attendants who could answer anything you asked. I really loved the giant missile recovered from a failed German attack during World War 2. The views from the keep were also unparalleled and are well worth the walk up the narrow stairs. Really, just go here; you won't regret it.

"Cute, Good Service & Small, Delicious Menu","Caught up with a few friends for dinner and we chose this cozy spot. The menu is delicious and healthy albeit a little small, perhaps a little too pricy for the serving sizes. We picked a few plates to share and they were all pretty good, some of which were the mushroom dish, fish and lamb sliders. It was lovely sitting right by the window while sharing a bottle of wine. You could easily spend the same amount on dinner elsewhere for larger amounts of the same quality food though.",Date of visit: June 2016,Comodo,4,"New York City, New York"
Perfect 3 Day Trip,"We stayed here for 3 nights and thought it was perfect given the duration of our stay. I have stayed at several all inclusives, including RIU Montego Bay, but this one was probably one of the best.

Housekeeping was really great and came by twice a day for serious cleaning. We really appreciated that since the rooms got humid and wet as soon as you opened the balcony door. Speaking of the balcony, our view of the pool and Palm Beach were just gorgeous. It was definitely a pleasure to wake up that every day. The pool itself was enormous and the perfect temperature. RIU outdoes itself with all of the palace decor. When we didn't want the pool, the beach was literally right there and what could be better than that?

The buffet food was quite good for this kind of resort and breakfast was usually the best meal of the day. Lunch featured a limited variety of foods but dinner offered a greater assortment. I would recommend any of the pastas and the sushi! It is totally possible to eat well and avoid filling up on junk or heavy stuff. I also loved the welcome drinks at dinner and make your own mimosa station at breakfast!

The staff was pretty friendly and we never had trouble getting cabs or with anything else. One thing is that the wifi wasn't all that great in our room but it was better by the pool. Overall, it hits the mark with value, location, food, and service.",Date of stay: April 2016,Hotel Riu Palace Aruba,4,Aruba
Left a piece of my <3 here!,"My girlfriend and I ended up spending an entire day on the island thanks to the incredible pack of flamingos that pace the beach. They are everything and so is Flamingo Beach. It is absolute perfection and away from all the hubbub.

We booked the island cove for massages in the morning and spent 3 hours of total bliss just sipping champagne and admiring the gorgeous blue water around us. We felt spoiled. After that, we made our way back (just 100 steps or so) to Flamingo beach and grabbed a couple of loungers.

We spent all day swimming, relaxing, drinking and feeding the flamingos! There are tons of lizards around as well. It was a very engaging yet laid back experience and I am so glad we made it to Renaissance Island. The boat ride there and back is short and sweet.

I will always remember this beautiful island and the amazing day we spent here!",Date of experience: April 2016,Renaissance Island,4,Aruba
Hearty Food + Gorgeous Flowers!,"After a million years of having this place on my list I finally went! I took my girlfriend here for her birthday dinner and it was a good choice, albeit stuffed and waddling by the end of it all.

They had beautiful flower arrangements by the entrance and by the bar. Overall, I found it to be super cozy and without a stuffy presence. This goes for the tavern area at the front and the dining room, which is where we sat. Our server came over for drink orders and returned shortly with them in hand. I enjoyed both of the cocktails we ordered.

Bread and blue cheese butter, you get a thumbs up. We both had the pork bolognese to start and it was sooo good, if a little salty. I am not complaining though. For our mains, I had the lamb 3 ways which was superb, and my girlfriend had the striped bass – also delicious! I cannot get over how well each type of lamb was cooked.

The portions are not huge, until it comes to dessert. I got the chocolate fudge cake and she got the carrot cake. My plate was super rich and honestly I couldn't finish it. I tried her carrot cake and it was moist/delicious. For her birthday, they brought out their signature coconut cake with a candle and I thought it was a very special touch. We tried to finish everything but at this point we were uncomfortably full and had barely even drank anything. There was room for no more but out came the petit fours. They were delicate and tasty. After that, they gave us granola bars for breakfast and I appreciate that little touch.

Overall, I had a great experience and it was romantic yet laid back – just what we needed. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because I feel that they fill you up with the sweet stuff to make up for small main portions. However, this would not deter me from coming back! :)",Date of visit: May 2016,Gramercy Tavern,4,"New York City, New York"
Private Island Cove Splurge,"We booked the private island cove on a Friday morning and it was a truly wonderful beginning to our time in Aruba. The boat picked us up, along with our two masseuses in the Renaissance Hotel and within 10 minutes we were at Renaissance Island.

I can't say enough about the gorgeous cove we had all to ourselves. The massages melted our stress away and we were both drifting off thanks to the sound of water all around us. This experience started our trip off on the right foot. We enjoyed an entire day at Flamingo Beach since our package included an all-day stay on the island.",Date of experience: April 2016,Okeanos Spa,4,Aruba
"Delicious, relaxing, and romantic!","Overall, I give this place 5 stars for the view, the ambiance, the unfaultable service and the unique dishes we had. Everyone who works here is friendly and can't do enough to make your meal/experience special.

We went at 6pm to catch the beautiful sunset and it was perfection. We had a table on the beach but not directly in the water. Small waves washed over our feet anyway and it was great. They have little racks by every table to put your shoes so they don't float away or get wet.

We had a couple of tasty drinks and the tuna tataki which was superb. My girlfriend and I both decided to try the unicorn fish as mains and it was no mistake. It was well cooked, clean and not too heavy. Everyone seemed to be celebrating a special occasion and our server Michael brought out dessert (chocolate ravioli) with a cute sparkler. This looked really wonderful since it was dark out by this time.

We spent a total of 2.5 hours here and I would definitely come back! It is a little pricey when you include the $70-80 round trip taxi ride from the hotel area (we stayed at Riu Palace) but is totally perfect for a special dinner or just alone time with your SO.",Date of visit: April 2016,The Flying Fishbone,4,Aruba
Delicious Korean Comfort,"The food here is soooo good and it's a very cute space! My girlfriend and I love coming here for dinner when we're in the mood for relaxed, quality dining during the week. There is always a line even at 5:30 so try to book a table in advance.

We've had a lot of things on the menu and they are all great. The galbi is soft and flavorful and the seafood dishes are good, but the PORK SWEET & SOUR FRIED RICE is out of this world. We crave it all the time now!! I can't even describe how wonderfully complex and palatable this dish is. They also offer carafes of soju bumbling with blueberries (and other flavors) that are excellent for sharing throughout dinner.

This is probably our favorite Korean spot of all time. The only thing I would suggest is broadening the dessert menu. Otherwise, amazing job every time and kind, friendly service.",Date of visit: January 2016,Her Name Is Han,4,"New York City, New York"
They did everything to make up for a kitchen blunder!,"I'd been here before and the food was great so we decided on Friedman's for dinner before a concert at MSG. It's probably one of the best restaurants in this neighborhood that's terrible for dining, and just downright delicious regardless of that.

We had fresh burrata to start, with two slices of yummy ciabatta. Unfortunately the kitchen lost our order and mains never arrived. I think our server assumed we had eaten since the tables on either side of us had completed their meals. He offered us dessert and when I said we never even got our entrees, he looked horrified. They were out in less than 10 minutes and the staff was truly apologetic. They offered us free drinks, a bottle of wine, dessert, you name it, on the house.

Rundown of food – the brick pressed chicken with potato puree was hearty and delicious and my girlfriend said her burger was good, too. Waiter brought us a big, moist slice of their signature carrot cake and it was probably the best I've ever had.

At the end of it all, our app, drinks, and dessert were on the house!

I will always come back here thanks to a lovely menu & a staff that really goes out of their way to treat you well. Thanks, guys!",Date of visit: March 2016,Friedman's,4,"New York City, New York"
"Good Time, Great Food!","The staff here is so nice and accommodating! That's the first thing I noticed which says something. The restaurant is very cozy and a comfortable place to catch up with friends over great food. I went with a couple of my coworkers and it was a very enjoyable dinner. We corked a bottle of wine and shared moules frites which was delicious! The mussels came in a delicious & unique saffron cream and the fries were nice. I had the prosciutto ravioli for my main and it was perfectly cooked and portioned.

We would totally come back here again. I recommend dinner reservations since the restaurant filled up fairly quickly by 6/6:30.",Date of visit: February 2016,The Odeon,4,"New York City, New York"
Beautiful Space + Great Food,"We were literally the first people at Buddakan for dinner and I'm glad because it gave us time to admire the cavernous space and over the top décor. The upstairs areas and bar are dark and sexy while the main dining area is a little more festive and relaxed.

We were seated in the main dining area at a spacious table for 4 even though it was just the two of us. This gave us room for our bags and privacy from the adjacent table.

My girlfriend and I tried 3 of the cocktails and loved them all. My favorite was ""Fate"" as I was in the mood for a bit of bubbly.

We decided to share everything so here's the breakdown. The oxtail dumplings had tender chunks of meat nicely balanced by apples and jus; a perfect starter. Next we shared the mushroom chow fun which was perfectly cooked and had a good amount of sauce/smokiness, the Peking duck fried rice which had great flavor, and the Mongolian lamb with crystallized ginger crust. The lamb is one of the best meat dishes I've ever had. The ginger sugar crust is really unique and even hella pretty to look at. Don't miss it. The portions were perfectly sized to share between the two of us and we had room for dessert. We opted for the coconut chocolate ganache which had such a smooth texture and incredibly rich taste.

What really topped it all off was the warm service we received from Alyson. Our glasses were never empty and she always appeared to clear up our plates without ever being overbearing. She knew exactly when her presence was needed and really made us feel well taken care of!

It was a surprisingly relaxing date night here and we will most definitely be returning!",Date of visit: March 2016,Buddakan,4,"New York City, New York"
The Best Fidi Pizza,"We've been here for lunch many times since I work across the street. I rarely crave pizza and usually would rather go for an Artichoke slice but Adrienne's is bomb! It's thin, authentic, saucy, and delicious! Trust me, I would never order lasagna at a restaurant but this place kills it and I end up soaking up all the sauce with our bread basket. Yes it's loud and it seems like they rush you but that's a good thing on a short lunch break. Get pepperoni or prosciutto! Everything is fresh!",Date of visit: January 2016,Adrienne's Pizzabar,4,"New York City, New York"
Top 5 NYC Brunch,I God damn love this place. There will always be a wait but who the hell cares. Came here most recently with my best friend on Christmas Eve. We both got egg-centric mains and split banana nut pancakes. The pancakes were freaking amazing and my eggs Benedict were divine. Easily the best I've ever had. My favorite winter drink of all time is definitely their buttered rum. It's incredible!

Exactly what it is!,It's a pub and a pretty good one. As far as food goes it's just okay. We really disliked the calamari and they didn't charge us for it. The rest of our food was good. Staff is great for sure and prices are amazing for I-Drive places when you're from NYC. Drinks were pretty much half-price to us.,Date of visit: July 2015,The Pub,4,"Orlando, Florida"
Best on I-Drive!,"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants at all but this one is amazing. The décor is cute, the staff is awesome and the food is just very clean/fresh/tasty.

I had the ribs which were excellent and my girlfriend had one of their seafood entrees. They also make some pretty delicious drinks!",Date of visit: February 2016,Bahama Breeze,4,"Orlando, Florida"
Spectacular :),We spent all of Valentine's Day wandering around Magic Kingdom and this was the perfect way to end the day. Thee light show on the castle itself right before the fireworks is just so incredible and emotional for long time Disney fans. They incorporate new stories as well like Frozen and Brave. It's really beautiful. I've always loved fireworks. The production exploding above and behind the castle is really amazing. It lasts quite a while as well so you can really enjoy it. This is definitely something you should stick around for even if you're tired. It's so worth it! :),Date of experience: February 2016,Happily Ever After Fireworks,4,"Orlando, Florida"
Valentine's Day <3,"Maybe it's because I'm older now but it seems like it has lost a bit of the magic. I remember seeing more characters and just a generally greater spectacle. However, it was still an amazing day! There was the usual crazy amount of people but the weather was a great escape from -11 in NYC. We went on quite a few rides and never waited more than 45 minutes. The only ride we skipped was Peter Pan's Flight because who has time to wait 2 hours for that. I am still so glad we chose to come here for Valentine's Day because at the end of it all, the Electric Parade and Wishes Fireworks just made it feel so romantic. Magic Kingdom will always make you feel like a kid and that's why people love it so much.",Date of experience: February 2016,Magic Kingdom Park,4,"Orlando, Florida"
Cute Experience,"We went for the breakfast buffet and Magic Kingdom was already busy at 8:30 am. Good thing we made a reservation, which I highly recommend for all restaurants. The food was actually pretty good albeit a little heavy. Pooh and the gang came around one at a time. We got some really cute pics so we were happy. Tigger was the best. Definitely worth it at least once. Breakfast is $30 per adult.",Date of visit: February 2016,The Crystal Palace,4,"Orlando, Florida"
Perfect Hotel & Staff,"This hotel is really big since most conference goers tend to stay here. Expect hundreds of people milling about sometimes. This doesn't stop Hyatt staff from taking care of you. The bell hop and front desk are really professional and friendly; they'll do anything to make your stay better. We had a king room on the 30th floor with a gorgeous view of the pools & lake in the distance. The room/bathroom was spacious and our bed was huge and comfy. We appreciated the coffee + 2 bottles of water they replaced every day.

The pool area is really nice and has several pools + a hot tub. The other tower also has a huge terrace pool on the roof. We only got to enjoy this on our last day since the rest were spent at Disney but I'm grateful anyway.

I'll do reviews separately but the B-Line Diner was great for breakfast and Fiorenzo Italian Steakhouse was good for our first dinner. Both a little pricey but not bad and the food was good.

We spent out last day walking the entire length of the I-Drive and Hyatt's location is perfect since it is right at the start of everything. Whenever in Orlando, I will definitely be staying here again. Uber rides to the parks were only $10-15 and there are tons of dining options around.",Date of stay: February 2016,Hyatt Regency Orlando,4,"Orlando, Florida"
Mad Cheap + Good Waffles & Coffee,"1. Good waffles.

2. Good coffee.

3. Pretty great hashbrowns.

4. Service is actually nice but the place itself is a bit dirty/sticky as to be expected.

Consistently Wonderful,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC and has been for years. The menu is great with a fresh mix of sushi, seafood and steak, plus incredible dessert selections. The décor and ambiance are fantastic with servers who really know their stuff. The entire staff excels at taking care of you! It's very cozy and they've got the whole leather club chairs, exposed beams & bricks thing down. It's perfect for a romantic night out!

I will say that it's worth the wait because the restaurant itself is very cute the first & second time around. After that you'll be returning only for a deliciously varied offering of scones, delicious tea (especially the chocolate chai) and pretty great food. The chicken hash is something I love dearly.

2. SERVICE was excellent. Girls at the front were very friendly and immediately took us to our table. Our server was also incredibly lovely and and the end he brought out dessert with ""happy anniversary"" printed on a chocolate placard included with our gorgeous dessert that was set aflame.

3. The restaurant itself is just beautiful and I love the lighting fixture in the center. Very modern & futuristic yet somehow it achieves a level of coziness.

Yes, the food is a bit pricey but we really enjoyed it! Definitely worth it and we would return without a doubt. The antipasto board was delicious, especially the super fresh BURRATA. We couldn't get enough of that stuff, or the bread. Our pasta & meat plates were also tasty but the PANNA COTTA, omg.

"Cozy, Delicious & Unique","Good service, good drinks, nice atmosphere, excellent music & décor.

Now let's get to the food. This was a surprisingly adventurous dinner. We hadn't really looked at the menu beforehand so I was surprised to find one unlike that of any other Thai restaurant I've ever been to. We shared the sweetbreads, green curry snails and khao soi (noodles and chicken in golden curry). All of these things were delicious; super flavorful, balanced and exciting to eat (how many times do you ever really say that about food?). For dessert I had the condensed milk toast with a scoop of coconut gelato and it was to die for.

Will definitely return to try the rest of this menu.",Date of visit: November 2015,Uncle Boon's,4,"New York City, New York"
Incredible,"This is easily one of the most beautiful beaches on the planet and the cleanest, purest, most magical one I've ever seen. The water is exceptionally clear, the sand is soft & white, and it wasn't at all crowded. Plus, there are food & drink kiosks at the entrance to keep you going all day. If you walk down the beach you'll find old graffitied tanks that add real historical character, too. We took a quick 12 minute flight from Ceiba in a small, frightening plane to avoid the whole ferry situation and it was so worth it. The scenery below is actually quite breathtaking once you get over it. We felt safe!

Cool Flavors that Melt Too Fast,"We were craving ice cream and this was rated the best in San Juan, plus it had a line out the door.

Amazing Mushroom Risotto,"We walked past this place while searching for a good lunch spot and the waiter/greeter gave us two samples of their mushroom risotto. Half a block later as we dug in, we decided to turn around because I had to have more. I'm not even a risotto fan but I wanted a whole plate of the stuff. Service was really friendly, our meals were good, and we got to sit with delicious mojitos in the adjacent cobblestone area outside. So happy we stumbled upon this place!",Date of visit: September 2015,"El Asador, The Grill House",4,Puerto Rico
Perfect Summer Treat,Finally made it here while it's still warm enough and I'm glad. I love shaved ice and anything blue so the damn yeti tracks hit the spot.

You can definitely make some delicious combos.,Date of visit: September 2015,Snowdays,4,"New York City, New York"
Gorgeous Hotel & Wonderful Service,"We stayed here for one night in order to make the most of exploring Old San Juan and it was PERFECT. The location is absolutely ideal since it's close to Paseo la Princesa, El Morro and all of the restaurants & bars you could want. The front desk was very friendly and they upgraded us to the Pablo Casals Suite (Honeymoon Suite) which was an incredible room. It had stunning marble floors all over, a beautifully decorated living room with a lot of space and nice furniture & an equally gorgeous bedroom with a large king bed, couch & cute as ever Juliet balcony (awesome view of church). This suite is actually very private & hidden from all the other rooms. It is however very close to the terrace, rooftop pool & area where they have free water/coffee/fruits 24/7.

The rooftop terrace with a plunge pool & hot tub is also such a cute ordeal. There are several loungers for sunbathing and shaded tables under a gazebo. The pool is obviously quite small and I suppose just ideal for 2 people. The rooftop itself has a lovely view of the waters surrounding Old San Juan.

We took advantage of the wine & cheese hour before heading out to dinner and they had quite a decent selection of wines. The cheeses and fruits were good, as well as the coffee. I can't say enough about how great it was to have 24/7 access to cold bottled water!

The layout of the hotel is beautiful since the rooms are built around a courtyard/patio restaurant with another level of restaurants/bars on top. We had breakfast at Patio del Nispero on the ground level and our eggs benedict was delicious albeit service a little slow. Overall, it was a good experience.",Date of stay: September 2015,Hotel El Convento,4,Puerto Rico
Unforgettable Hotel + Incredible Service,"Words can't really describe how breathtaking this hotel is. We stayed at 3 hotels in Puerto Rico and I am SO glad I saved this one for last. It simply puts every other place to shame. The buildings & towers are beautiful and majestic in every way. Tastefully decorated, beautifully restored and 4 pools that you never want to leave or stop taking pictures of.

The front desk was very pleasant upon greeting us. They offer complimentary champagne and then our bell hop gave us a short tour of the place while he brought our bags up. He was very friendly and showed us where everything was in the room.

I booked a King Ocean View Tower Room but they upgraded us to the Biltmore Ocean View Suite and it was twice as large with a living room, huge bathroom with tub & shower + two sinks & larger than average C.O. Bigelow bath products. Not to mention, the suite had a gorgeous balcony from which we could perfectly watch the sunrise. The bedroom was very spacious with big windows for a great view & our enormous king bed felt like a big cloud.

The pool area & restaurants/bars are all stunning as well & super friendly bartenders/servers bring you everything you need, from towels to delicious drinks. I wish we had spent more than one night here because it is DEFINITELY worth the splurge and I would come back in a heartbeat; we miss it so much!

My tenderloin was perfectly cooked to medium and melt in your mouth delicious. My girlfriend said her fish was also really good. They have an interesting & unique cocktail menu so we tried two of those. My girlfriend got the global warming drink which was berry flavored with a chili flavored ice cube for a really spicy kick. I had the adult cereal drink (so delicious) which tasted of almond milk soaked oatmeal & sugar. Mmm! It was one of the best meals of my life and I will be dreaming of that tiny white bean soup for as long as I live.

We hadn't really looked at the menu beforehand so I was surprised to find one unlike that of any other Thai restaurant I've ever been to. We shared the sweetbreads, green curry snails and khao soi (noodles and chicken in golden curry). All of these things were delicious; super flavorful, balanced and exciting to eat (how many times do you ever really say that about food?). For dessert I had the condensed milk toast with a scoop of coconut gelato and it was to die for.

Will definitely return to try the rest of this menu.",Date of visit: November 2015,Uncle Boon's,4,"New York City, New York"
Incredible,"This is easily one of the most beautiful beaches on the planet and the cleanest, purest, most magical one I've ever seen. The water is exceptionally clear, the sand is soft & white, and it wasn't at all crowded. Plus, there are food & drink kiosks at the entrance to keep you going all day. If you walk down the beach you'll find old graffitied tanks that add real historical character, too. We took a quick 12 minute flight from Ceiba in a small, frightening plane to avoid the whole ferry situation and it was so worth it. The scenery below is actually quite breathtaking once you get over it. We felt safe! I dream about this beach and know I'll definitely be returning for years to come.",Date of experience: September 2015,Flamenco Beach,4,Puerto Rico
"""Original"" Piña Colada","We'd previously read that they invented the piña colada and stopped in since we were walking by anyway. Had the regular piña coladas; they were strong, good and only $7. Not bad for a tourist trap.",Date of visit: September 2015,Barrachina Restaurant,4,Puerto Rico
Cool Flavors that Melt Too Fast,"We were craving ice cream and this was rated the best in San Juan, plus it had a line out the door. I had the Ferrero Rocher ice cream pop and my girlfriend had the coconut. They were both really tasty but melted in a matter of seconds and made a total mess!",Date of visit: September 2015,Senor Paleta - Old San Juan,4,Puerto Rico
Amazing Mushroom Risotto,"We walked past this place while searching for a good lunch spot and the waiter/greeter gave us two samples of their mushroom risotto. Half a block later as we dug in, we decided to turn around because I had to have more. I'm not even a risotto fan but I wanted a whole plate of the stuff. Service was really friendly, our meals were good, and we got to sit with delicious mojitos in the adjacent cobblestone area outside. So happy we stumbled upon this place!",Date of visit: September 2015,"El Asador, The Grill House",4,Puerto Rico
Perfect Summer Treat,Finally made it here while it's still warm enough and I'm glad. I love shaved ice and anything blue so the damn yeti tracks hit the spot. Tbh it does just taste like sweet cream x cookies. They have the usual toppings with some great options like fruit purees and condensed milk. You can definitely make some delicious combos.,Date of visit: September 2015,Snowdays,4,"New York City, New York"
Gorgeous Hotel & Wonderful Service,"We stayed here for one night in order to make the most of exploring Old San Juan and it was PERFECT. The location is absolutely ideal since it's close to Paseo la Princesa, El Morro and all of the restaurants & bars you could want. The front desk was very friendly and they upgraded us to the Pablo Casals Suite (Honeymoon Suite) which was an incredible room. It had stunning marble floors all over, a beautifully decorated living room with a lot of space and nice furniture & an equally gorgeous bedroom with a large king bed, couch & cute as ever Juliet balcony (awesome view of church). This suite is actually very private & hidden from all the other rooms. It is however very close to the terrace, rooftop pool & area where they have free water/coffee/fruits 24/7.

The rooftop terrace with a plunge pool & hot tub is also such a cute ordeal. There are several loungers for sunbathing and shaded tables under a gazebo. The pool is obviously quite small and I suppose just ideal for 2 people. The rooftop itself has a lovely view of the waters surrounding Old San Juan.

We took advantage of the wine & cheese hour before heading out to dinner and they had quite a decent selection of wines. The cheeses and fruits were good, as well as the coffee. I can't say enough about how great it was to have 24/7 access to cold bottled water!

The layout of the hotel is beautiful since the rooms are built around a courtyard/patio restaurant with another level of restaurants/bars on top. We had breakfast at Patio del Nispero on the ground level and our eggs benedict was delicious albeit service a little slow. Overall, it was a good experience.",Date of stay: September 2015,Hotel El Convento,4,Puerto Rico
Unforgettable Hotel + Incredible Service,"Words can't really describe how breathtaking this hotel is. We stayed at 3 hotels in Puerto Rico and I am SO glad I saved this one for last. It simply puts every other place to shame. The buildings & towers are beautiful and majestic in every way. Tastefully decorated, beautifully restored and 4 pools that you never want to leave or stop taking pictures of.

The front desk was very pleasant upon greeting us. They offer complimentary champagne and then our bell hop gave us a short tour of the place while he brought our bags up. He was very friendly and showed us where everything was in the room.

I booked a King Ocean View Tower Room but they upgraded us to the Biltmore Ocean View Suite and it was twice as large with a living room, huge bathroom with tub & shower + two sinks & larger than average C.O. Bigelow bath products. Not to mention, the suite had a gorgeous balcony from which we could perfectly watch the sunrise. The bedroom was very spacious with big windows for a great view & our enormous king bed felt like a big cloud.

The pool area & restaurants/bars are all stunning as well & super friendly bartenders/servers bring you everything you need, from towels to delicious drinks. I wish we had spent more than one night here because it is DEFINITELY worth the splurge and I would come back in a heartbeat; we miss it so much! The staff is very well trained and they really know how to make guests feel treasured & pampered. I can't wait to go back!",Date of stay: September 2015,Condado Vanderbilt Hotel,4,Puerto Rico
Great History & Views/Architecture,"Rich with history, beautiful & totally worth exploring for a couple of hours. The views from every angle are lovely and really transport you back in time. It's only $3 to get in!",Date of experience: September 2015,Castillo San Felipe del Morro,4,Puerto Rico
Incredible Food & Service,"First of all, the TINY WHITE BEAN SOUP is probably the most AMAZING thing I've ever eaten in my life. You must order it! Our waiter was very friendly & lovely at explaining and recommending things. We weren't hungry enough to do tasting menus but that's okay because our entrees were really delicious. My tenderloin was perfectly cooked to medium and melt in your mouth delicious. My girlfriend said her fish was also really good. They have an interesting & unique cocktail menu so we tried two of those. My girlfriend got the global warming drink which was berry flavored with a chili flavored ice cube for a really spicy kick. I had the adult cereal drink (so delicious) which tasted of almond milk soaked oatmeal & sugar. Mmm! It was one of the best meals of my life and I will be dreaming of that tiny white bean soup for as long as I live. It's the perfect spot for a romantic dinner & we can't wait to return someday!",Date of visit: September 2015,Marmalade Restaurant & Wine Bar,4,Puerto Rico
Chic & Delicious,"This is the perfect place for a trendy, romantic, oceanfront dinner but the best part is how down to earth and comfortable you'll still feel. I made reservations weeks before and they set us at a cute table on the outside deck. Service was excellent and my girlfriend & I both fell in love with an incredible coconut ginger daiquiri they make here. We shared the ceviche and braised beef dumplings, both of which were delicious. She had the apricot chicken and I had the palmero pork! Both dishes were very filling (we couldn't finish them) and super tasty but a little sweeter than we're used to. The pork is glazed and also comes with guava jam while the apricot chicken is pretty sweet on its own. Overall, it's a really beautiful restaurant with friendly, polite service & awesome vibes.",Date of visit: September 2015,Oceano,4,Puerto Rico
Cute Outdoor Dining + Good Food & Service,"We had just arrived in San Juan and were looking for a light, quality lunch. I was delighted to see Serafina in Condado since I'm from NYC and knew it was capable of hitting the spot. It's only been open for about two weeks from what we heard but the food & drinks are good, the service is friendly & efficient, plus the outdoor seating is pretty & comfortable. It was just what we needed!",Date of visit: September 2015,Serafina San Juan,4,Puerto Rico
Always Good Food & Amaze Happy Hour,My friends and I come here all the time for drinks & dinner. They recently extended their awesome happy hour until 10pm so we fill up on their $3 mojitos and beers like no tomorrow. I've never had a complaint about any dish here. The appetizers are all good and I usually get the drunken man noodles; so delicious!,Date of visit: August 2015,Klong,4,"New York City, New York"
Excellent Food,"My friends brought me here for a belated birthday dinner and it was a perfect, casual time. We shared the spring rolls & BBQ calamari; both were good. I had the tamarind duck and it's probably THE most delicious duck dish I've ever had!! My friends had pad Thai & drunken man noodles which were also good. The servers are very attentive and they have a unique, tasty drink menu as well. My pink orchid was refreshing and very aromatic. I'll be back for sure.",Date of visit: August 2015,Jaiya Thai,4,"New York City, New York"
Baffling Waiter,"Wth. The drinks were good and that's the only good thing I have to say. My cousins and I had just landed and were starving. Our waiter was clearly out of his mind, wanted to ""chat"" for way too long and never even came back with our drinks or take a food order. He just wandered around the restaurant. We had to flag down another waiter after about 25 minutes just to inquire about our drinks and order food. The aforementioned idiot then walked by to check on us and said, ""I guess you guys ordered from my friend, I have no idea why, but okay, hope everything is good."" The food was alright too but I'm a big service person and I can't give this place more than 2 stars.",Date of visit: July 2015,Chili's Grill & Bar,4,"Clermont, Florida"
"Energetic, Romantic & ABBA!","I saw this show a couple of years ago and it's still one of my absolute favorites! If you love ABBA you can't miss this. The storyline is romantic, the script is funny & every actor on stage is full of charm. Get orchestra seats if you want to get up & dance!",Date of experience: April 2015,Mamma Mia! on Broadway,4,"New York City, New York"
"Funny, Colorful & Beautiful!","This show was so beyond spectacular. The cast, music, costume design & special effects were incredibly well done. I would go back to see this again in a heartbeat!

Best Lobster Roll in NYC,"I've been here twice now and it's definitely the best lobster roll you'll find in this city. The fries and salad are good, too! The service is friendly and it's good for big groups and gets packed fast after work.",Date of visit: June 2015,Burger & Lobster,4,"New York City, New York"
Fresh & Convenient for Lunch,"I come here a lot since I work half a block away. The lunch special is always worth it! For around $13 you can choose from various rice, noodle, and other entrees. I've had all of them, from the Malaysian Chow Fun to Tonkatsu Ramen. Bento boxes are good and the sushi here is always very fresh. The pork belly buns are seriously the most delicious thing! Try it all.

This spot is also a bit of a hideaway from messy midtown crowds and Macy's so I love it.",Date of visit: July 2015,Asura Asian Bistro,4,"New York City, New York"
Solid Experience/Authentic Indian,"4 of us made it here for dinner on Friday night. The place was empty but they still seemed hesitant to give us a table that was reserved for 7:15, even though it was 5:15.

The service was standard & the food was good. Two of my friends got the chicken tikka masala, I had lamb vindaloo (my fave dish) which was excellent, and my girlfriend got some delicious aloo gobi. Their butter and garlic naan was also superb. Everything overall, was really good!

I would come here again.",Date of visit: July 2015,The MasalaWala,4,"New York City, New York"
Beautiful Space & Good Food,"Been here twice, including last night for my birthday! My girlfriend and I shared the peekytoe crab fritters, jamon iberico, shaved beets, half a dozen oysters & spicy glazed baby back ribs. Everything was great and we were content without dessert. They also make really great drinks here; the mariposa is great and the blueberry lavender martini is delicious!

The restaurant itself is semi-loud and has a great atmosphere for dining with friends. It's also perfect for dates. The restaurant itself is chic & cute with great decor & awesome lighting structures.

Service has been excellent both times I was here!",Date of visit: July 2015,ABC Cocina,4,"New York City, New York"
My Favorite Space in NYC,"I've been to several spas and this is always going to be my favorite. I went here last night for the 3rd time. My girlfriend surprised me with a session for my birthday and she loved it, too! She booked 45-min 4-handed massages for us and I had never had one before. My masseuses were great and they did a lovely job.

The best part of this gorgeous underground haven is the array of pools. An instant calm will wash over you as soon as you step foot into this elegant oasis. The pools are different temperatures ranging from hot to rigid, there's a floatarium & an aromatherapy steam room; the salt water makes it really easy to float. The ambiance is very peaceful & makes for a really romantic time.

Although there are other people in the pools (just a few since they limit booking per time slot), it's a super private experience. Definitely the perfect way to treat yourself or a significant other! And if you're looking to get away from the manic buzz of this city + need a little pampering, there's no better place to go.",Date of experience: July 2015,AIRE Ancient Baths New York,4,"New York City, New York"
Amazing Views!,"This zip-line trail is really high up and the views you get from up here are incredible! You just have to do it! The guides are really great, funny guys and they make you feel really safe. I admit I was scared because some of the platforms required you simply jumping off which I'm not really used to. However, I'm glad I pushed forward because it was sooo worth it!",Date of experience: August 2014,Tree Limin' Extreme Zipline,4,St. Thomas
Average - 4 Stars For Being On The Beach,"This is a very average hotel when it comes to rooms & amenities. It's location however is excellent. You can't beat being right on the beach, plus the staff is lovely & very friendly. Breakfasts in the morning are basic, but good. Bridgetown is just a quick drive away and there's a bar right across the street that has great nightly drink specials if you don't want to trek too far for a night out.",Date of stay: May 2015,Coconut Court Beach Hotel,4,Barbados
Local Must Do Experience,This is a well-known Friday night shenanigan in Barbados. It's just something you have to do if you want to experience local culture/nightlife. There is tons of delicious fried fish to try & lots of beer to go around. There's music & lots of drunk dancing by the stage but mostly everyone is just hanging out having a good time!,Date of experience: May 2015,Oistin's Friday Night Fish Fry,4,Barbados
Best in Barbados,"This is one of my favorite beaches of all time, not just in Barbados! The water is clear, sand is white and scenery is just beautiful. I was in Barbados for my cousin's wedding in May 2013 and our family had a cricket match here one day. It was a really lovely time and I still think about this beach fondly. I'd love to come back one day. You can buy drinks at a bar right there & peruse the various jewelry & clothing vendors on site. Everyone is very friendly!",Date of experience: May 2015,Accra Beach,4,Barbados
Meh,Beds were comfy and I liked the wooden floors in the room. There's nothing really special about this place but it was alright for the one night we needed to stay here for a wedding nearby. The bathroom was kind of gross though and didn't have have hot water.,Date of stay: July 2015,Four Points by Sheraton Scranton,4,"Scranton, Pennsylvania"
Best In The Area,"This is probably the only hotel I'll ever stay at in this area. The location is very convenient and my grandparents live close by hence my cousins and I choosing this place. We only stayed here for two nights but our double queen room was clean and comfortable. They serve decent breakfast in the mornings and the staff is real nice. Overall, a good place to get a room in Clermont. They have a decent sized pool but we never used it since a good number of kids were always in there.",Date of stay: July 2015,Hampton Inn & Suites Clermont,4,"Clermont, Florida"
Good Korean Food in Florida!,"I was beyond surprised and relieved to find good Korean food in this state. I'm from NYC so my standards for Asian cuisine in general are obnoxious. We had galbi (well seasoned & delicious), ddukbokki (super spicy & wonderful), (average) chicken fried rice and some (average) pork belly. Everything was fresh, authentic & inexpensive. I would come back here if I ever find myself in Longwood again. The staff here is also quite nice.",Date of visit: July 2015,Korea House Restaurant,4,"Longwood, Florida"
Good Brunch,"Got a living social deal here so my girlfriend and I came for brunch on a rather mellow Saturday around noon. The BBQ pulled pork eggs benedict platter was pretty good and the salad that accompanied was delicious as well.

My Go To,"When I want to catch up with an old friend over good wine & food, this is a place I turn to. I've also been here with my girlfriend and she loved it. The staff is really nice, plus their selection of wine is lovely. I've been here several times so I've tried tons of different things. The sweet ice wine is worth trying & the chocolate wine is really smooth & unique! It's super delicious and one of my favorites. They have great charcuterie boards and everything tastes fresh. The guava jelly that comes with the meat & cheese is to die for.

They even have a great lunch special that's awesome & less than $15. You get to choose from a combination of paninis, soups & salads and I always leave satisfied.

It's definitely more romantic at night & sometimes they have live jazz, making for the perfect date spot!",Date of visit: April 2015,Ayza Wine & Chocolate Bar,4,"New York City, New York"
For Giggles,"My cousins and I came down from NYC for the weekend to visit the grandparents and we only had one free night so ended up doing random sh** for giggles' sake. This is really just an opportunity to feel like an idiot and laugh at yourselves. We all got the $34 2 drink experience which was good enough because by the time we finished our first drink we were freezing and ready to bounce. The bartenders/staff are really nice and good at their jobs. And the drinks are strong & delicious! Overall, a short, good time but still a cheesy thing to do.",Date of experience: July 2015,Minus 5 Ice Bar,4,"Orlando, Florida"
A Gem,"Being from NYC where outdoor swimming spots are no where to be found, I immediately loved this place. I was visiting my cousin in Austin for the weekend and she brought me here when I said I wanted to swim. It was the Friday before July 4th so there was a long line but it moved really fast. The sloping lawns are great for relaxing on and for catching a tan. The water was damn cold but super refreshing. Overall, the atmosphere is chill and has great vibes! It's definitely a unique place to swim and has a pretty cool view of downtown's buildings. It's just $3 to get in and the shack outside the gate sells this delicious watermelon juice worth trying!",Date of experience: July 2015,Barton Springs Pool,4,"Austin, Texas"
Relaxing Kayaking/Great Views,"Came here with my girlfriend & cousin July 4th weekend for a beautiful hour of kayaking. We rented a couple and headed down the river for spectacular views of all around green. The water was high, calm and just perfect for a relaxing day. The staff at the dock are super friendly & helpful. We were only in Austin for a few days and I'm glad we experienced the beauty of this lake.",Date of experience: July 2015,Lady Bird Lake Hike-and-Bike Trail,4,"Austin, Texas"
Great for Breakfast,"Try to grab a table outdoors and enjoy a couple of breakfast tacos! They're all really good, especially the chorizo ones but that's just me since I'll eat anything with chorizo in it. They were about $3 each and the coffee was pretty good as well.",Date of visit: July 2015,Mi Madre's,4,"Austin, Texas"
Pretty Darn Good,"I visit Baltimore often and my brother-in-law is the reason I finally stopped at this place. It's really not for eating-in so you just order and leave with your BBQ goodies. The sandwiches, ribs and fries are really good and their special BBQ sauce is quite delicious. Try this place!",Date of visit: April 2015,Chaps Pit Beef,4,"Baltimore, Maryland"
Great BBQ,"Came here on a Friday night so there was a 1.5 hour wait but it was a pleasant wait thanks to live music and a few beers! I got the all you can eat special so here's the breakdown: brisket is tender, sausage is okay (good and salty but regular sausage) and the ribs came right off the bone. I really love their delicious cole slaw and potato salad too! Definitely worth a visit if you ever find yourself in Austin!",Date of visit: July 2015,Salt Lick BBQ,4,"Driftwood, Texas"
Friday Night Party,"So we were told to come here for a good time on Friday night in Montego Bay and it was just that. The drinks were good, the pier is beautiful and the music well, just what you'd expect! It gets really packed and the bar is hella crowded but that's what you get at an awesome party!",Date of visit: January 2015,Pier 1,4,Jamaica
Great for Dinner,This place is just a few blocks away from the beach and is perfect if you're craving sushi/noodles or just good Asian food. I had a tasty glass noodle dish with beef and super fresh sushi. The drinks here were pretty good and everything just tasted real. The service is friendly and the restaurant is clean & stylish. Awesome vibes!,Date of visit: April 2015,Wok N Roll Restaurant & Oyster Bar,4,"Tamarindo, Costa Rica"
Surf Central,"This beach is pretty nice but the water isn't calm and every good for swimming. After all, this where one of Costa Rica's surf camps is located. There were tons of lessons going on and that really fun to watch. My parents and I rented a couple of chairs & an umbrella so we could catch a tan and just enjoy a dip or two in the water.

They offer horse rides on the beach if you're into that and none of the vendors that peruse the area are very pushy. I liked that. I have to say I never stop to pick up shells but the ones I saw at this beach were so gorgeous I brought a handful back.

It's definitely a safe, patrolled and easy-going beach.",Date of experience: April 2015,Tamarindo Beach,4,"Tamarindo, Costa Rica"
Great for Snorkeling,"I really liked this beach! It does get a bit crowded but that's to be expected. We took the ferry over in our car and the ride wasn't very long.

They have an underwater snorkeling trail that's pretty neat and the water is very calm; I saw tons of fish and coral. It's a very beautiful beach and stretches out for quite a distance. You can rent snorkeling gear and the like, plus there's a lifeguard on duty.",Date of experience: July 2014,Trunk Bay Beach,4,St. John
Favorite Meal in Honduras,"I went to Siguatepeque on a Habitat trip and our group had dinner here one night. The restaurant is in a private setting which is very nice and has tons of wood decor for a natural look & feel. The food was plenty and it was delicious! They really know how to grill meat and their hot sauces were fiery goodness.

The restaurant has a little shop that sells jewelry, coffee & other neat little things. The restaurant staff also presented us each with a bird of paradise which I thought was adorable.",Date of visit: July 2014,Restaurante Villa Verde,4,"Siguatepeque, Honduras"
Good for Families,"This is definitely a great place for kids (and there are plenty of them around). Located right on the beach, the park is gorgeous and features turtles, birds, sharks, & tons of marine life in the aquariums. It's a beautifully designed space and doesn't get too crowded, nor is it very expensive.",Date of experience: July 2014,Coral World Ocean Park,4,St. Thomas
Great Beginner Beach for Snorkeling,"Clear water & white sand but crowded since it's right next to the Ocean Park. I saw tons of fish while snorkeling and they were beautiful! This is the perfect water for a beginner snorkeler although it can get rough at certain times by the small reef on the right side of the beach closest to the park. Also, be careful of sea urchin because my dad stepped on a ton of them and was stuck with dozens of spores for about a month! I loved this energetic slice of paradise.",Date of experience: July 2014,Coki Point Beach,4,St. Thomas
Visiting Vandy,"If you're from NYC like me and are used to everything being hella convenient then stay here. The hotel itself is modern & beautiful, the staff is really friendly and they offer a discount for people visiting Vanderbilt (which is nice since rooms are pricey).

The location is pretty central to everything. Vanderbilt University is right across the street, East Nashville is a short drive away, and the downtown nightlife is also just a few minutes drive away. My room was spacious & comfortable, plus it had huge windows looking out at the city.

My best friend and I had one last brunch in the restaurant downstairs and the food was good & hearty. I would definitely stay here again.",Date of stay: July 2014,Loews Vanderbilt Hotel,4,"Nashville, Tennessee"
Best In This City,"This isn't necessarily 4 stars compared to other hotels but for the city and country it's in, this hotel is super cute and offers everything you need for a really good stay. It's definitely the best in the area and generally a beautiful property.

The pool is nice and the bar is super cheap. Top shelf liquor for 3 USD. Mind you, I had been staying in a motel for the past week during a Habitat for Humanity build in Siguatepeque. The property is adorable and I shared a humongous two bedroom space with one of my friends. The bathrooms are also very large which is a plus.

There are tons of outdoor patio areas scattered through the place for awesome ways to hang outside at night. The staff at the hotel is really nice and friendly, plus they were having a big party at the hotel that Saturday night. All guests were invited!

It's in walking distance of some pretty great local restaurants and outdoor markets for stuff like handmade jewelry and artwork.

After a week of some hard work it was definitely a relief to stay in this charming, laid back hotel.",Date of stay: July 2014,Hotel Marina Copan,4,"Copan Ruinas, Honduras"
Mystical - Rich History,"So if you've already to been to sites like Chichen Itza these ruins might be a little underwhelming but they are no doubt an incredible sight to see. Once you climb to the top of these ruins, the view is worth it as well. We were told this was doable in flip flops but that was a big mistake; wear sneakers.

The place is pretty magical. Not gonna lie, our guide bored us to tears and ants ate the hell out of our feet and it was the hottest, driest day in Honduras, but it still proved to be a special place.

Romping around the most ancient of Mayan playgrounds is pretty neat. The architecture is beautiful and you definitely feel a hard mystical vibe all around. The ruins really are deeply rooted in history and you will feel that once you're there. It's not something you want to skip if in Copan.",Date of experience: July 2014,Copan Ruinas,4,"Copan Ruinas, Honduras"
OMG,"The last thing you'd expect to blow your mind in Honduras is a German microbrewery! This was one of the best meals I've ever had and the beer was just outrageous. Mind you, I rarely give beer a chance to begin with.

My Habitat team and I had dinner here on our last night in Honduras. Tomas, the owner, is one of the nicest guys I've ever met and he's got 2/3 beers on tap. He brews it himself and the stuff was incredible. I am by no means a lightweight and was borderline trashed after 2 pints.

The food was so hearty and just what we needed. Tomas' wife does the cooking and we had huge plates of sausage, potato salad and impressive schnitzel. We left, extremely full and satisfied! Not to mention the meal barely cost more than $15 USD.",Date of visit: July 2014,Sol de Copan,4,"Copan Ruinas, Honduras"
Beautiful & Modern,"So this hotel has nice rooms, modern decor and a pretty neat casino inside. It also has beautiful bar and a great pool/private beach area.

It's in the perfect location with plenty of restaurants and stores nearby so try to avoid the expensive food options at the hotel. The meals are overpriced and not very good, either.

The best part of being here is that you're close to the water and basically everything you need. Old San Juan is very close and absolutely in walking distance.",Date of stay: October 2014,The Condado Plaza Hilton,4,Puerto Rico
