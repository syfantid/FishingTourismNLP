"This is the way to see Milos and surrounding Isles, Top Notch!!","Captain Paul and Eugenia were very knowledgeable and entertaining to say the least, its the unspoilt part of Greece that's a must. An abundance of great local food wine and offcourse ouzo.

We even saw a large Mahi Mahi in one of the caves,
Highly recommended activity do it !!!",Date of experience: September 2018,Milos Adventures,5,"Milos, Greece"
Captain Nikos is a legend old school fisherman,"This boat represents the heart and soul of this island, he showed us how to put nets out and use rods. Then the fish we caught he cooked in a wonderful little cove. The boat is over 12 m long and we took out kids... they loved it.. Fishing snorkeling, local knowledge and cheap.. A MUST do",Date of experience: September 2018,Milos Fishing Experience,5,"Milos, Greece"
