Really good lunch and lovely environment,"I love the White Hart with its thrilling and immediate connection to the Battle of Britain . The photos of the pilots are wonderful
The pub is managing the Covid restrictions without allowing them to ruin all atmosphere and we had a particularly nice waitress Molly . The food was really excellent - 5 of us had 3 different things and were all very pleased . The mini puddings with coffee are brilliant too
Well done White Hart !!",Date of visit: September 2020,The White Hart,4,"Brasted, United Kingdom"
Lovely beach but go early !,"Lovely bay and crystal clear water - but you need to get there early as by 10/11 the beach will fill up andbecome a bit too crowded
But definitely worth and early morning swim as is the most beautiful place",Date of experience: July 2020,Love Bay (Limanaki Agapis),4,"Poros, Greece"
Best boat trip ever,"Our family have been on a lot of boat trips but this was the best ever. Nice boat, lots of shade, great scenery - and then the excitement of watching Giannis spear fish - then every one helped with the whitebait nets and others fished from the boat
A lot of fish caught , cooked and eaten for lunch - just perfect !
We swam and snorkelled , but for our teenagers the highlight was the fishing
Giannis and George were charming hosts and Giannis took the youngestcin his very high speed boat for the last bit - very exciting
Highly recommneded - a great trip",Date of experience: July 2020,Poseidon Fishing Trips,4,"Poros, Greece"
Nice friendly restaurant,"Just next to our hotel , the New Aegli, so very convenient on a hot evening . Nice staff, good food and very relaxed atmosphere !",Date of visit: July 2020,Panorama Resto,4,"Poros, Greece"
Excellent restaurant,Very busy restaurant on the Poros town marina - great food but particularly smart service ( can be a bit slow in restaurants !),Date of visit: July 2020,Poseidon taverna,4,"Poros, Greece"
Excellent hotel and brilliant location,"The New Aegli is set right on the beach within walking distance of Poros Town (cheap teaxi better when it's very hot !)
The staff were charming, trying to work within the Covid restrictions , but they managed pretty well
The facilities are really good - lovely area by the pool , roof bar at night and a lovely terrace for breakfast
We had a garden balcony room with enough space outside for the family to gather for drinks before dinner - perfect ""
Hotel highly recommended",Date of stay: July 2020,New Aegli Resort Hotel,4,"Poros, Greece"
Lovely gallery featuring a wonderful painter,"The Boudin museum in Honfleur is a show case for the work of Boudin who was a friend of Monet 's and worked alongside him painting views of the Normandy coast
The museum is small and not properly advertised -the tourist info implies there are lots of Impressionist paintings there including Monets - but really it is about Budin and his colleague Duborg ( a discovery for me)
But Boudin is a wonderful painter - so go and enjoy !",Date of experience: June 2019,Musee Eugene Boudin,4,"Honfleur, France"
One of the world's greatest art collections,The Frick is wonderful - certainly one of the greatest art collections anywhere - the Holbeins and the Gainsboroughs particularly are just dazzling - and all in a beautiful 5th Avenue setting with views over Central Park,Date of experience: November 2019,Frick Collection,4,"New York City, New York"
Fascinating and unusual experience,"The excavation of Nero's Palace is a work in progress but there are fascinating glimpses of frescos and decorations - the scale of the place was staggering !
During the tour you are given a virtual reality headset which then recreates the palace for you and surrounding ancient Rome - I was thrilled by it but some of the headsets don't work so well as my friends found - ask to swop straightaway if yours is not good - when it works properly it is stunning !",Date of experience: April 2019,Domus Aurea,4,"Rome, Italy"
"Fabulous palace , delightful visit !","The Palazzo Colonna is stunning - entirely beautiful with wonderful contents - book to see the Galleria and the Isabella rooms - you don't want to miss a thing
Unlike in many state Italian museums, the staff are charming and welcoming - everything to the cafe at the end is beautifuly done
Absolute gem !!",Date of experience: April 2019,Palazzo Colonna - Galleria Colonna,4,"Rome, Italy"
Lovely nostalgic atmosphere,"The Grand has a great atmosphere of it colonial past and history- wandering around the hotel was a pleasure - thebilliard room with itsivory balls, pianos playing everywhere , the photos on the walls - very grand and elegant. Staff very nice , spa expensive, restaurant fine
Really good contrast to the eco lodges we had been staying inon our tour",Date of stay: December 2018,The Grand Hotel,4,"Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka"
Gorgeous eco lodge !,We loved Kalu's Hideaway - setting was fantastic with a lovely infinity pool looking down towards a river - bird life excellent . The restaurant was very good and staff charming (best English we found on our tour ) Excellent base particularly for visiting Uda Walawe National Park,Date of stay: December 2018,Kalu's Hideaway,4,"Udawalawe National Park, Sri Lanka"
Lovely hotel in gorgeous setting,We loved the Amaara Lodge - lovely rooms set in tropical gardens . Nice restaurant and great spa ! The staff were incredibly nice too - only sadness was how many cancellations they had had because of the recent political unrest . They deserve good bookings ! We spent 3 nights there - excellent base for visiting Sigiriya and nearby parks,Date of stay: December 2018,Amaara Forest Hotel Sigiriya,4,"Sigiriya, Sri Lanka"
Excellent overnight stop,"The approach to the hotel isn't promising (name is a bit odd too !) but when you go in, it's really pleasant with a nice garden and pool. The bedrooms were spacious and clean and the restaurant was good
We enjoyed our stay",Date of stay: December 2018,Pledge 3,4,"Negombo, Sri Lanka"
Family lunch,We had a birthday celebration lunch at the hotel and were really impressed by the food and particularly the service- really excellent! It's a beautiful place in a beautiful setting - we were delighted !,Date of stay: June 2018,Ashdown Park Hotel & Country Club,4,"Wych Cross, United Kingdom"
Spring visit,"Having been several times in the hot Summer, we stayed at Gunays Garden in April to see Turkey in the Spring - brilliant ! countryside is beautiful covered in wild flowers and though warm and sunny , it was cool enough to explore new places without wanting to make a dash to the pool. The ruins at Patara which we wandered around by ourselves were a highlight , as was the delightful and quality Fetihye museum . Gunays as lovely as ever with an excellent dinner inside with a log fire keeping us as warm as in July !!",Date of stay: April 2018,Gunay's Garden Villas,4,"Kayakoy, Turkey"
"Good hotel, great location !","The location is amazing - easy walk to Capitoline Museum, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon , almost next door to the Doria Pamphili palace - one of THE highlights of Rome Surprisingly the restaurants around are reasonable - particuarly liked the Locanda del Tempio
Rooms smallish and fairly basic but perfectly OK . Staff charming and breakfast for 6 euros was fantastic !!
We'll certainly go back there - excellent and reasonable hotel",Date of stay: January 2018,Hotel Regno,4,"Rome, Italy"
Fantastic museum - poor staff,"Probably my favourite museum in the world - it is so beautiful and the collection, particularly the Berninis wonderful
I've have visited 3 times in recent years and have noticed each time how grumpy and unhelpful some of the staff are - the audio guide staff behave as if you are interrupting their day and the room guides look bored and irritated if you ask them what number the room is for the audio tour (not clearly marked )
The service lets down a truly great museum",Date of experience: January 2018,Galleria Borghese,4,"Rome, Italy"
Unusual and very interesting tour,"The tour of the excavations under the Palazzo Valentino is fascinating - the remains they have found of Roman houses are fantastic and imaginatively augmented by film and virtual recreations . The close examination of the Trajan's pillar is a great end
Disconcerting standing and walking on the glass in the gloom but you get used to it !!",Date of experience: January 2018,Le Domus Romane di Palazzo Valentini,4,"Rome, Italy"
Wonderful museum beautifully presented,"The Doria Pamphili is gorgeous - sumptious is the best word. The audio guide by the current owner is perfect - charming and informative. It cleverly picks out pictures with a great story behind them so you are much entertained going around as well as enjoying the sheer beauty of the Palazzo
Incredible value too- we went in the evening (it's open til 7pm) and the lighting just enhanced everything and not too many people !",Date of experience: January 2018,Palazzo Doria Pamphilj,4,"Rome, Italy"
Gorgeous hotel,"On a recent tour in India , this was our favourite hotel - beautiful palace sympathetically converted - service was first class - location is in a suburban area so not surrounded by shops or restaurants but this didn't matter as the prices in the restaurant (and spa) were very reasonable ! there was charming live music in the restaurant (not amplified hurrah !)",Date of stay: December 2017,Shahpura House,4,"Jaipur, India"
Lovely hotel in excellent location,"Le Petit Chomel is very well located near a metro and within walking distance of the Musee Rodin, Musee D'Orsay and the Luxembourg Gardens . It is very charming - a building with character. Bedrooms nice and breakfast excellent
Nice bar just down the road and a fantastic restaurant Les Botanistes next door !",Date of stay: April 2017,Le Petit Chomel,4,"Paris, France"
