Boat trip with an original twist,"Idilic day began with nicely presented Greek breakfast. We then arrived at the site where Captain Gerry had set his overnight nets. It was fascinating to watch him pull these in and catch what was to become our super fresh lunch. A couple of stops for swimming and turtle spotting, all the while being informed of the area and way of life by both Gerry and Panos. A fantastic lunch of giant prawns with spaghetti , Greek salad and then fried fish all prepared on board, and a lovely local wine.
We used both the motor and sail when possible.
Captain Gerry and Panos went to every effort to make a memorable day for us. We may even try to book again before we leave - need I say more!",Date of experience: June 2019,Poseidon Fishing Tourism Kefalonia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
One of the best curries for quite some time.,"Visited whilst staying at an airport hotel. We selected it because it is just 3 minutes up the rail tracks and a very short walk. We were certainly glad we did. The starters and mains were lovely, the naan breads light and the service very friendly. We will certainly be visiting again when next overnighting at the airport.",Date of visit: March 2015,Rasa Indian Restaurant,4,"Marston Green, United Kingdom"
Good Choice,"If you can, opt for the 5th floor rooms- recently renovated and well in excess of 3 star rating.
Breakfast ok and staff helpful.
Location in excellent. 5 mins from Termini, towards a better part of town and 5 mins from Republica for metro etc.
Good restuarants in the locale and also found a bar/cafe across the road to the side of the theatre that had a happy hour 4-8pm that made evening drinks affordable.
Overall a good choice.",Date of stay: November 2011,Hotel Sonya,4,"Rome, Italy"
Does what is says on the tin,"I have to echo most of the comments here, the staff were excellent, the rooms (standard) were large and regularly cleaned. The view was not up to much and I do feel an improvement would be a small fridge in the room and a kettle.
But as an inexpensive B&B I think it offered great value for money.
As for Turunc, eating out is excellent and inexpensive.
It's a shame people seem to leave a lot of dog ends on the beach but take the 10.30 boat to Amos or Kumlubuk) for a great beach experience. I would go back to both The Pelin and Turunc.",Date of stay: September 2010,Zeus Turunc Hotel,4,"Turunc, Turkey"
