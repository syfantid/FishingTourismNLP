Amazing tour! Do this and you won't regret it :),"Started the day being collect from our apartment doorstep, with a private tour of a local vineyard follow by a mouth watering snack! Including homemade olive oil, locally sourced tomatoes and feta, freshly baked bread and hand picked olives. All washed down with local white wine and homemade greppa!!
Then onto the bit we were waiting for.. Wine, wine and more wine. We were driven to the cooperative winery (all the local farmers come together to create wines) where we sampled the classic Kefalonian wine, Rebola, among with a few other local wines. Then onto a local winery where we sample everything from dry reds and whites down to the sweetest wines ever! Truly a day to remember, would deffo recommend it even if you're not a big wine lover!!",Date of experience: September 2018,Kefalonia Wine Tour,5,"Kourtesi, Greece"
