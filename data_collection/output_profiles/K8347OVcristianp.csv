A great experience!,"Sun, sea, fishing and a great boat with great people. What more can you want? This is trip you will remember.",Date of experience: September 2018,Captain Tasos,3,"KÃ³s, Greece"
Slightly disappointed,"The concept of the place is admirable. Prices are ok and the garden is pretty beautiful, but there are too many smokers for my taste and that kind of collides with the concept of no pollution/healthy lifestyle. But the thing that let me down was the service. The waiter was nice, but it took forever and she constantly forgot to bring us things (a menu when we asked for one, we also asked for pints and she brought glasses, but charged for pints, the food took forever to get there and it was almost cold, even though she said it's straight out of the oven). Overall, unsatisfied.",Date of visit: May 2018,Cuib,3,"Iasi, Romania"
Great time!,"I was there with some friends and colleagues and we had a great time! Can't remember the name of the room, but it was pretty difficult and we barely managed to escape. Would go again.",Date of experience: April 2017,Master Escape,3,"Iasi, Romania"
