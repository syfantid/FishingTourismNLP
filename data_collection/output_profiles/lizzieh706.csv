Negombo City Tour - Best Day out,"An excellent day out - not too early start. Met tour guide Suresh at 09.30 am who took us in his Tuk Tuk to Waikkal train station where we boarded the train with all the locals - a very authentic, cultural experience! Suresh then met us at Negombo train station and took us to the port and fish market where we were shown all the drying processes for the fish. He then showed us the Dutch built canals and after that he took us anywhere we fancied stopping. We got great bargains in clothing and souvenirs and stopped at a lovely little local cafe - no other tourists for an iced coffee. He even got us a great of exchange for GB pounds sterling - better than the bank! Nothing was too much trouble. When we were finished in Negombo, Suresh took us to the canal where we boarded a lovely boat - just the two of us and we sailed along the canal back to our hotel, stopping to be shown local wildlife and birds and even a huge water lizard. Overall, a very enjoyable experience - a Great day out. Would Highly recommend Rohan tours and shop. Excellent service - Five stars, very good value too.",Date of experience: January 2020,Rohan Tours Waikkala,5,"Waikkal, Sri Lanka"
Best trip ever in all my world travels.,"Amazing experience on a Truly authentic, family run Greek fishing boat. Fantastic to see all the different varieties of fish being reeled in, including my favourite - Lobster - Lots and lots of Lobsters - I have never eaten so much Lobster in one meal! Absolutely delicious! This was all cooked up for a Delicious lunch with fresh vegetables and salads and fruit from the family's garden and served with very spagetti and nice Greek wine. Cold drinking water is also provided. We, the guests swam in the clear blue sea whilst our feast was being prepared. Antonia provided us with a wonderful overview of Greek life and history in between cooking and attending to our every need. Wonderful hosts and perfect holiday activity. Highly highly recommend this trip to everyone visiting Kefalonia. The sea was calm and the views stunning too. Myself, my friend and my cousin thoroughly enjoyed the day. I also very much liked the fact that it is a small family run trip which only accommodates 12 people - there were 9 of us which allowed us a lot of personal attention and question & answer time too. Antonia even drove us back to our hotel! Thank you very much Antonia and Michalis and crew.",Date of experience: June 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
