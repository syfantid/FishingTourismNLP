2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8032IImartins,August 2020,5,Amazing boat trip - swimming and snorkeling,"This boat trip with George was fantastic. We went out on his nicely refurbished and well adapted boat for a day trip along the coast and the close islands, stopped for swimming and snorkeling at almost untouched beaches and had a great time. Eating and drinking was included and George is a great host! He is a former fisherman who knows a lot about the sea and the region and shares his stories with guests. I can highly recommend this trip. „Swimming and Dreaming“ at its best !…"
