An experience that you shouldn’t miss,"We had a brilliant morning with Luke and his team of beautiful birds of prey. We met owls, a hawk and a falcon - they were beautiful and Luke had so much great info to share. He was great with our two children who loved meeting and flying the birds. Highly recommended :))",Date of experience: August 2020,Birds of Prey Experiences,5,"Whitestone, United Kingdom"
Totally utterly brilliant! I’d give it 10 stars if I could,"We went on a half day swimming and boat tour with Captain Gerry and his lovely daughter Sissi - with our two kids who are 8 and 5.

Right from the day kicking off it was fab. We were greeted with a warm welcome at the harbour and sat down on the beautiful fishing boat to set off to sea. We heard all about Captain Gerry’s 40 years of fishing around the island. A full breakfast is provided with fresh coffee, cereal, toast, Kefalonian honey, juice and sandwiches.

We’d told Sissi that our 5 year old son is animal mad so first we went turtle spotting - amazing to close down the engine and bob along waiting for the huge turtles to bob up. We saw three :)).

Then we headed to the deserted and beautiful beach for swimming - only reachable by boat. The family have thought of everything - especially for the kids they had floats and snorkels and - best of all - mega inflatables. Captain Gerry also has a little row boat to take you to the shore as he wants to take you the traditional way - though you could swim it if you want to. We were there for a couple of hours snorkelling and playing in amazing clear turquoise water. After that we slowly headed back to Lixouri with the sails out.

I’ve been on many holiday boat trips but none come close to this authentic experience. Please go! The best thing is that Sissi and Gerry are so so kind, especially with the kids. They are clearly so proud of the island and their boat and genuinely want to make

"Beautiful, peaceful, 'real Spain' including for families.","We stayed at El Sueno in June 2014 for two weeks with our two small children (1 and 4) in Mimosa Casa. It really is a wonderful, peaceful and idyllic place to stay. The finca is so well thought out with everything you need for a fab holiday - but in a way that feels effortless and natural. We enjoyed the swimming pool, play park for the kids, the flowers and insects in the gardens. Swing chairs among the lemon trees provide a shady spot. Accomodation high quality and spotless. Great for families with all the kit you need. There is really sound advice in places to see, beaches and places to eat. In the evenings we'd put the kids to bed, enjoy a glass of wine and tapas watching the sunset over vejer. Stunning. Also enjoyed meeting other guests many of whom had little ones who our daughter made friends with....

Come here if you like real Spain, quiet unspoilt beaches and peace. Pricier than we normally go for and worth every penny. Highly recommended.",Date of stay: June 2014,El Sueno,5,"Vejer de la Frontera, Spain"
Gorgeous place to stay and owners extremely helpful,"I'm writing this review because I've been looking over some of the recent posts and I had a totally different experience to other guests. Myself and my friend Jen stayed at Madhuban back in February. It's quite simply gorgeous - a real oasis of calm to escape to from the vibrancy and madness of Jaipur. Rooms are lovely and the garden quite beautiful. I travel loads with work and for pleasure and this place sticks out in my mind as being really lovely.

Mr and Mrs Dicky Singh were SO, SO friendly and helpful to me. Half way through my holiday to India I had a job interview via phone to the UK and I did the interview from Jaipur / the hotel. I was really nervous and worried about the logistics of it so got in touch with them directly beforehand from Nepal and they gave me full advice about how the panel could be in touch with me. When I was there they went out of my way to help me organise a special phone from the room to do the interview (with direct line call) and since return have been in touch about the outcome (which was positive - starting new job in a couple of weeks hurray).

They're busy people and went beyond the call of duty to help me.

The rest of the hotel services were great too - good restaurant (would have done anything for a cold beer tho!), great help with booking brill tour and also place for excellent Indian Massage. Also picked up and dropped off at the bus station. Just brill

Book it! Stay there! Enjoy it!!",Date of stay: February 2007,Hotel Madhuban,5,"Jaipur, India"
