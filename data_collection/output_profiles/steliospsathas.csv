Amazing Captain! Best experience,"We decided to go with Captain Andreas for a fishing tour... it was one of the best experiences that we had in Milos! We took a fishing course,then we visited the fantastic beaches of Polyaigos and after all,we cooked the fishes that we caught! Andreas is one of the best guys i have met in Milos! I would definitely suggest it!",Date of experience: June 2019,Milos Poseidon Boat Fishing & Tours,5,"Milos, Greece"
