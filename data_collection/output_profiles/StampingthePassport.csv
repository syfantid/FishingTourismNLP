Our go to,This is our local coffee house and being picky coffee drinkers it couldn’t have been a more perfect discovery in our new village. Julia and the girls are fantastic and always light up your day. The simply food items and baked goods are super tasty and baked fresh daily. The Oat Milk Flat White has been a lifesaver.,Date of visit: November 2017,Scandimania Coffee House,4,"Uppingham, United Kingdom"
The closest thing to Aus!,Brunch and good coffee is the ultimate Aussie combo and finally we have found somewhere in the UK that gives us that. What a discovery!,Date of visit: February 2018,Bowden Stores,4,"Great Bowden, United Kingdom"
What a hostel!,"If every hostel could be as efficient, clean and awesome as this one, we wouldn’t have any problems. The variety in room choices and the cooking and social spaces is perfect. Prague has so much to see and do and this hostel has the perfect location that takes you away from the centre of it all and gives you a chance to explore another area. The vegan around the corner and the Mexican down the road is awesome too.
We will be coming back again!",Date of stay: June 2018,Czech Inn,4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
Highly recommend!,"Transfer to our accommodation was quick, easy and at a great price. He was waiting at the airport for us even though we were almost 30 minutes late arriving.
Highly recommend! Plus we loved the tips and explanation of where we were while we were driving to our hotel.",Date of experience: July 2018,Kefalonia Best Price Taxi,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Perfect spot to rest your head,"We can't explain how good the hospitality and warmness we felt from Christine. Of all the places we have visited, she went above and beyond for our visit. From recommendations, to advising us of companies to use and to greeting us every morning and afternoon with a smile, Blue Paradise Studios was the perfect home away from home for us. Although you have only a small kitchenettte, Argostoli and Kefalonia are incredibly affordable and you have all the necessary items in your studio to keep the budget down if you need to.
We could not recommend Blue Paradise Studios more as the place to stay in Argostoli and Kefalonia.",Date of stay: July 2018,Blue Paradise Studios,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
What a Day!,"Mixalis, Antonia and their lovely daughter Nikki were the best hosts. Not only did we have so much fun eating and swimming in the best places that Kefalonia offers, but we learnt so much - from the Greek language all the way to species of fish and how to cook them perfectly.
You feel like one big happy family by the end of the trip and it is the perfect way to see a different side of Kefalonia and of Greece.
Fishing is such an important part of life in this part of the world and why not experience it with the best.
Thank you Fishing Tourism Kefalonia 'Michalis' for letting us share a fantastic day with us.",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best host and great tour,"Julia picked us up promptly from our accommodation in Argostoli and the kindness was present even before we got in the car. We enjoyed a lovely 4-5 hour tour through the wine region of Kefalonia learning about Robola and experiencing it first hand with Julia, who is in fact a winemaker and farmer herself. She is an expert and incredibly passionate about what she is talking to you about. We loved spending the day with her and could not recommend this tour more.
Our favourite part was being in her home and eating and drinking her own products - a true locals experience. Thanks Julia!",Date of experience: August 2018,Kefalonia Wine Tour,4,"Kourtesi, Greece"
Great guide and a great way to see Athens,"Tanya was so incredibly lovely and really was passionate about Athens and showing us the local and authentic side of Athens.
This is a great tour for those wanting to move beyond the touristy things of Athens and would be ideal if you were spending more than 3-4 days in Athens and have the time to look further afield. We were so lucky to even have the tour private of the day which was a great luxury.
Can't thank Alternative Athens enough for a real great experience! Highly recommend!",Date of experience: August 2018,Unexpected Athens Orientation Tour,4,"Athens, Greece"
Authentic Athens!,"Food is excellent.
Service is excellent.
The man who runs it is the cherry on top. He does it all. Cooks, clears, serves and chats. He is Greek hospitality and authenticity at its finest and we went back multiple times just for him.",Date of visit: August 2018,Aspro Alogo,4,"Athens, Greece"
What a day!,"We started with Aristotle and thoroughly enjoyed his city tour. He was very knowledgable and friendly. Then we had Thanasis for the rest of the day and he was hands down the BEST guide we have ever had in all our travels. He is funny, witty, incredibly creative and so knowledgable. We can't describe how perfect he was to have for our Acropolis and Agora tour.
This is a fantastic tour and yes, it does go for around 6-7 hours in total, but it is so worth it and we experienced the proper way to see the Acropolis. Do a tour! You won't regret it.",Date of experience: August 2018,"Athens City Tour with The Acropolis, Ancient Agora and The Agora Museum",4,"Athens, Greece"
A highlight of Budapest!,"Absolute must do in Budapest. These are the most famous baths and the architecture and design is certainly amazing. 'bathing' in Budapest is a true cultural experience and the people watching is excellent.
Definitely go earlier in the day before it gets busy and a little less clean.",Date of experience: May 2018,Széchenyi Baths and Pool,4,"Budapest, Hungary"
Great fun for all types of groups!,"Brilliant fun. The hosts were great. Interesting and interactive way to see the city. Really glad we took the 2 hours as it just went so quick because we had so much fun! Definite must do if you don’t mind a party atmosphere and a chance to meet some friendly, fellow like minded travellers or party goers.",Date of experience: May 2018,Wee Toast Tours,4,"Belfast, United Kingdom"
More than a hostel,"This hostel was everything we could have asked for and more. Brilliant location with tram lines out the front of the building. Spacious and clean rooms. Friendly and helpful staff. Well stocked kitchen and a super
Cool bar with great nightly events.
The area has lots of great independent cafes and shops, we loved the cool vegan fast food just around the corner and a supermarket nearby to get your essentials. It was home away from home and it will be hard to beat this.",Date of stay: April 2018,Czech Inn,4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
The perfect Amsterdam stay,"The most beautiful, spacious apartment. It was hard to believe that we were in one of their 2 star rooms, as it was everything we could have wanted and needed and more. The restaurant and cafe were perfect for every meal of every day and totally within our budget. Very impressed and would definitely stay again.
Perfect connections with the tram and only 5 mins on the tram directly to Amsterdam Centraal. So easy to get around and staff were incredibly generous with their time to direct us to where we needed to go.",Date of stay: February 2018,Lloyd Hotel,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
One of our best experiences in travel,"Honestly, words cannot describe how amazing our 2 on 1 lesson was with Mike. We spent over 2 hours smiling and enjoying every minute of our surf lesson. We were nervous and apprehensive because in previous 'surf lessons' in other places we had never been able to stand up. We both stood up first go - miracle? No, just Mikes expertise and hands on approach to surfing. If you are in Newquay, don't question it. Book yourself a surf lesson with the Escape Surf School and have an unforgettable experience just like ours. We will definitely be back.",Date of experience: August 2017,Escape Surf School,4,"Newquay, United Kingdom"
Traditional cuisine at the best price,This place is always busy and has a line up all the time. And for good reason. Delicious food. Cheap food. Recommend the house prawns 'casa da gambas' and the 'Secrets of black pork.,Date of visit: July 2017,O Velho Eurico,4,"Lisbon, Portugal"
"A great vibe, but at a great cost","This place literally has the best food on offer. Don't get me wrong. But you are certainly paying for it. It is expensive and the serving portions are not huge.
Great atmosphere for a big group.",Date of experience: July 2017,Time Out Market Lisboa,4,"Lisbon, Portugal"
What a great tour!,"Andre lead us on an incredible journey to Sintra and Cascais. He was knowledgable, funny and witty. He enabled us to have our town free time to explore, but still with an organised tour in mind. Great combination!
Thank you Andre!",Date of experience: July 2017,Bespoke Tours,4,"Lisbon, Portugal"
The Highlight of Porto,"Honestly, this was not only our highlight of Porto, but one of our most memorable moments of Portugal. Andre was incredible - funny, knowledgable and such a joy to spend 3.5 hours with!

Cannot thank Taste Porto enough for an incredible experience. Our only regret is that we left this tour to the end of our Porto experience. Definitely do it first!!!!",Date of experience: July 2017,Taste Porto Food Tours,4,"Porto, Portugal"
Great vibe and great location!,"This is a very trendy hostel that is in a brilliantly central location. The staff were friendly, the included breakfast is of good quality and the facilities are kept very clean.
A great outdoor terrace is a real draw card for this hostel.

They also organised airport transfers to the hostel which was so affordable and so helpful",Date of stay: July 2017,PILOT Design Hostel & Bar,4,"Porto, Portugal"
"Not in the centre of Lagos, but it doesn't need to be","This is a beautiful beach style villa that allows all types of travellers to enjoy themselves. It has a pool, a poolside bar and an rooftop terrace. It truly does make you feel like you are in your own house.

Be prepared for a little walk to town and the beaches, but also feel like you will relax and get a holiday!",Date of stay: August 2017,Bura Surfhouse,4,"Lagos, Portugal"
Best food in Lagos,"This has a great vibe and delicious food. We were recommended this place by fellow travellers and it did not disappoint. We went back multiple times.

If in Lagos, you must go!",Date of visit: August 2017,Beats & Burritos,4,"Lagos, Portugal"
"Pricey, but incredibly tasty","Steak and Honour began as a food van and therefore I think their best burgers are from the van.
We had the Cheeseburger and Ella burger with fries. Wonderfully delicious! Mouth watering!
The seasoning on the fries is moorish and addictive. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meal and wanted more.
The downside is it is a little expensive for some, but gosh it is full of flavour",Date of visit: July 2017,Steak & Honour,4,"Cambridge, United Kingdom"
"Delicious coffee, friendly staff","Budget friendly and quality coffee. We went back multiple times because of this. The staff were incredibly friendly and always intrigued by each of their guests, particularly those from around the world.",Date of visit: May 2017,Soul Caffe,4,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
What a fun day of adventure!,"Our guides were brilliant, although the weather was beautiful, the wind made it quite difficult to kayak on the sea but our guides were supportive and really positive. There was an option for everyone whether that be the highly adventurous cliff jumping, the discovery of hidden caves or a nice snorkel.
The highlight was the traditional lunch on Sipan. Unforgettable and delicious food!
Could not recommend these guys more.",Date of experience: May 2017,Adriatic Kayak Tours,4,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
Great guide - Iva,"Iva our guide was awesome! Such an interesting perspective on Dubrovnik! We loved her!
Great attractions, good length in tour etc",Date of experience: May 2017,Dubrovnik Walking Tours,4,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
Perfect meal on a budget!,"As budget travelers we always look for great food at a great cost. This is the best place for lunch and/or dinner and the quality is fantastic!
This is a backpackers dream. Burgers are phenomenal",Date of visit: June 2017,Presa,4,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
We went back more than once,"Great pizzas, friendly staff and really fresh and delicious local produce.
The price is fairly standard for Dubrovnik, so maybe a little expensive for some people. The quality and the size of the pizzas particularly is great!",Date of visit: June 2017,Mea Culpa Pizzeria & Trattoria,4,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
Haunting and so informative.,"This was recommended to us by fellow travel friends and had they not have told us, we never would have known about it. This is a museum that showcases international and civil wars in photography and it is just incredible.
Spinetingling, confronting and just moving. Not for kids or the faint hearted. But a must-see!",Date of experience: May 2017,War Photo Limited,4,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
Seafood platter and a bottle of house wine,"The title says it all. We sat and listened to the hustle and bustle of the old town and the music from the restaurant a few doors down and enjoyed a bottle of house wine and the seafood platter.
It was so delicious that we didn't stop there and ordered dessert which was equally impressive.",Date of visit: May 2017,Dundo Maroje,4,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
Great family owned local Croatian eatery,"WARNING: the lamb under the bell is everyone's choice, but they need prior booking and warning as it takes at least 3 hoours to cook. We will be going back to Dubrovnik purely for this as we missed out as we didn't realise you needed to book. We did however have a great local stew which was mouth watering and cooked with love
Great prices, great view over Banje and friendly staff.
The decor is outdated and nothing fancy, but if you are happy with a view of the beach and great food and drinks - then who cares!",Date of visit: June 2017,Konoba Pjatanca,4,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
Go at sunset,"We had a magical time up the top of Mt Srd as we went at sunset and took some seriously incredible pictures. No matter what time you go though, the view is great if on a clear day. So plan your visit",Date of experience: June 2017,Dubrovnik Cable Car,4,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
Great selection of delicious icecreams,"We were told by our AirBnB host to stick with this whenever we wanted ice cream. They did not fail us - we went everyday and it was delicious. Very affordable and always a big cue, but that means good things!",Date of visit: May 2017,Poklisar,4,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
A great view every step you take,"These walls are famous for a reason. They provide endless views of the beautiful surroundings of Dubrovnik and it is a must do when you visit. Absolutely great, hot day when we went and it was not too busy. Be careful of when the tourist ocean cruise liners come in as the traffic of people around is CRAZY",Date of experience: May 2017,Walls of Dubrovnik,4,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
"Great views, great brews and some entertainment","Great views of the water and of an awesome cliff jumping spot.
A little pricey, but you are paying for the view and location.
It is hard to find if you don't know where to look. Follow the 'Cold Drink' signs to the left of the Jesuit church",Date of visit: May 2017,Mala Buza Bar,4,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
"Great location, friendly staff and good quality food","We head to this place before and after travels and it is always good value. The staff are always friendly and it is a welcoming space and great to do some work, read a book or meet a friend for coffee.",Date of visit: June 2017,Chill#2,4,"Cambridge, United Kingdom"
Contemporary and Cool,"Great hostel in a great location. The dormitories were clean, spacious and fitted with everything we needed. The coffee shop downstairs is awesome, particularly for coffee lovers like us! Lots of events daily for people staying and the staff are all so friendly. Only downside is the size of kitchen and that you can't cook meat. We probably would not stay here again knowing that we aren't able to cook meat.",Date of stay: April 2017,Away Hostel,4,"Lyon, France"
Great Aussie-style coffee!!,"This coffee shop is attached to a hostel which as people staying in it, was awesome! We loved waking up each morning and getting a great coffee. Very cheap, always something sweet and savoury to go with the coffee and the hours that the cafe was open were brilliant! Early morning and a late afternoon coffee was perfect!",Date of visit: April 2017,Away Coffee Shop,4,"Lyon, France"
Lacking a bit of love and care,"The location is too far from attractions. Our room wasn't clean and a lot of things were dated and needing attention. I was bitten by bed bugs in one of the private rooms on our first night, however they moved us and we appreciated it a lot. we will not be staying here again though.",Date of stay: April 2017,Le Village Hostel,4,"Paris, France"
"Awesome vibe, would be best in summer!","Had a great stay in Annecy. Location was really good, just far enough away from everything we wanted to do whilst in Annecy.
The staff were friendly and obviously work very hard as they were doing their own renovations on the outdoor bar.
I think this hostel would be best in Summer when the weather is warmer and the outdoor bar is working!
Rooms were great size and very comfortable and so affordable! Will stay again!",Date of stay: April 2017,Annecy Hostel,4,"Annecy, France"
Absolutely fantastic day of great food and sharing stories!,"Lucy was just so wonderful. The entire day was planned out so wonderfully and there was never a dull moment.
The market visit makes you feel like a local and the cooking offers enough of a challenge but still the reality that you can take it home and reproduce it.
Our group was made up of 3 Americans and the two of us and it made for a great day chatting and eating wonderful food. I cannot recommend this activity enough and Lucy was a wonderful host!",Date of experience: April 2017,Plum Lyon Teaching Kitchen,4,"Lyon, France"
Excellent Coffee and great vibe,"Fantastic coffee. My French needed work and the wonderful waiter let me try my hardest to order completely in French. I really appreciated it!
The smells coming out of the small kitchen were so wonderful.",Date of visit: April 2017,Slake,4,"Lyon, France"
Easy bike hire,Easy to work with and very affordable bike hire for the day. They fitted our bikes and gave us great instructions on how to maximise our cycling for that day. Really helpful!,Date of experience: April 2017,Takamaka,4,"Annecy, France"
What a wonderful evening!,"My boyfriend decided to take me on a date and he booked Pint Shop. Whilst the booking was for dinner at 8.30 (a little late), I can now see why you must be in early to secure a good time. The food was brilliant (recommend the Lamb Kebab) and the drinks were sensational. What got me though was the amazing service of our waiter, James. He was a young boy, but with a wealth of knowledge and he pretty much chose all aspects of our drinks and meals last night because we asked for all his suggestions and recommendations. So thank you James.

If you are in Cambridge for dinner, call up, get in early and book a table at Pint Shop. It will not disappoint.",Date of visit: March 2017,Pint Shop,4,"Cambridge, United Kingdom"
Best Coffee in Town,"If you are visiting Bathurst, you must visit Al Dente. It is the best coffee and Lara who is front of house is the loveliest lady ever!
They are a family owned and run business and they really care about the quality of their coffee and being loyal to their customers.
Hours are a little strange. Not open Sunday, and Saturdays are restricted hours.But if you are there during the week, you must drop in!

Must see in Bathurst.",Date of visit: December 2016,Al Denté,4,"Bathurst, Australia"
Delicious and very quick!,"Perfect place for a quick lunch with friends during the week, or a more extended visit over the weekend.
Excellent quality of food and its a fantastic small business that also includes a catering business. It is a Cambridge only venture.

Great lunch specials and great for kids. Has a really cool button you press for service - cool experience!

Check it out when in Cambridge!",Date of visit: January 2017,SmokeWorks,4,"Cambridge, United Kingdom"
Excellent food and drink - super busy on weekends!,"I love coming to visit Hot Numbers on the weekend. It has a delicious variety of filtered coffees and a great selection of blends, for the coffee connoisseur.

It does get very busy, however if you are happy to jump on the end of someone else's table, you will always find a spot.

Definitely check it out if in Cambridge area. Only a short walk from CBD",Date of visit: February 2017,Hot Numbers Coffee - Gwydir St,4,"Cambridge, United Kingdom"
No compensation or care for delayed flight,"To be honest, so many people had spoken so highly of Etihad when we told them we were flying with them. And now, it is safe to say I will never fly with them again, even if it was my last option.
We were delayed leaving Abu Dhabi by 3 hours initially, and for this we received a Burger King voucher to use at the airport. (Gross....)
We started to make our way to the gate to find silence for almost 3 hours (in addition to the already delayed time). Many people were getting really upset as we were not told anything about the delay. The attendees did not respond to any questions. This was extremely disappointing and so frustrating. We are generally very positive and patient people, and after this, we were even starting to get quite annoyed.
Once boarding the plane we were treated like absolute scum. The flight attendants were so rude to us and were not helpful in the slightest.
I would not recommend flying Etihad, particularly knowing that as a customer your needs are not met if the flight and airport are severely delayed.",Date of travel: January 2017,Etihad Airways,4,World
"Cheap, cheerful and efficient","Excellent. Was a little hesitant booking Icelandair, as I knew nothing about this airline. However, coming over to Europe, I have realised how many people recommend it and absolutely love it!
We had a fantastic experience with them and I would recommend them to anyone
Remember, sometimes the things you least expect, turn out to be incredible.",Date of travel: January 2017,Icelandair,4,World
Great local pub for the true Irish style!,"We googled this pub the night we arrived and it seemed to be pretty close to our accommodation, so we wandered down. Gosh, it did not disappoint. We arrived to a buffet style/cashier type menu where you grab a tray and add all the meat and extras and then grabbed a table (warning, Friday/Saturday nights are PUMPING) and enjoyed a cider and a pint of Guinness.
As a couple, we were sitting on a rather large table and were happy for anyone to join if they needed a spot to sit. A lovely Irish man sat on our table and spoke of the beauties of Ireland and in the end many of the things he mentioned and recommended we went and visited, so for us this pub has a wonderful vibe and we learnt of some hidden gems in Ireland because of the welcoming atmosphere. The fact that locals visit this pub and frequent it regularly, is a sign of how successful and authentic it is.",Date of visit: February 2017,O'Neill's,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
Perfect Sunday Roast on a Cold Winter Afternoon,"We visited Ely for the day and after visiting the Cathedral (MUST DO) and wandering the markets, we were recommended the Prince Albert Pub from a friend who grew up in Ely.
The Sunday roast was truly delicious, with everything included. The bar had a good range of beers and ciders and there were old board games on each of the tables which we loved.
The roasts were reasonably priced, however the more extensive menu was a little pricey for us.
Loved the atmosphere and even on a busy Sunday, they managed to fit us in. Really appreciated that!
Must visit for lunch/dinner if in Ely.",Date of visit: February 2017,Prince Albert,4,"Ely, United Kingdom"
Felt right at Home,"This guesthouse had a very welcoming and friendly vibe when we arrived. Our double room was situated on the top floor, overlooking a main road, however for us this was not an issue as we spent a very limited time in the room. It had a reasonable location to the town centre, with a small 5-10 minute walk to a range of cafes, shopping precincts and pubs. The stand-out for this guesthouse is the Full Irish Breakfast the next morning. Michael the owner cooks up an absolute storm, even asking whether you want scrambled or poached eggs! His warm, friendly hospitality certainly ranked at the top for experiences in our recent trip to Ireland. I would certainly recommend this guesthouse to anyone visiting Wexford and we would be certain to go back again. Thank you Michael!",Date of stay: January 2017,St. George Guest House,4,"Wexford, Ireland"
"Great Hostel, Great Location","If you are looking for a hostel that provides excellent service (including a complimentary continental breakfast), spacious rooms and excellent open spaces for living and cooking, then the Neptunes Hostel in Killarney is for you.
Although Wifi really only worked in these main living areas, it didn't matter, because the atmosphere of the hostel was excellent. It is in a fantastic, tucked away location that allows for the weary traveller to sleep, but the party traveller to keep on partying in the town centre.
We thoroughly enjoyed our few nights here and they reception was 24 hours and always extremely helpful and accommodating.",Date of stay: February 2017,Neptunes Hostel,4,"Killarney, Ireland"
"Budget, Friendly Accommodation in a Great Location","Well it is called Eyre Square Hotel for a reason, it is across the road for the Eyre Square Park, one of Galway's main attractions. It is around a 5 minute walk to the pedestrian zone that is filled with cafes, pubs, shopping and more. The hotel had a 24 hour reception which was very handy for any questions or queries and the service from the staff was extremely friendly.
The rooms are basic, but just what you need. We stayed in the hotels nicest room as we were a couple looking for some space at the end of our trip and it certainly had what we required. A reasonably priced hotel in a great location. Would stay here again.",Date of stay: February 2017,Eyre Square Hotel,4,"Galway, Ireland"
Best Burger this side of NYC,"After having visited NYC only a month ago, we had Burgers and Chips freshly on our mind. Bunsen Burgers on Essex St East delivered this and more. We left this place knowing that the following day we would be back for lunch.
The burger patty was deliciously moist, the potato side was a decent size and the burger itself came with all the fillings that a good burger is known for, including a pickle!
Highly Recommend.
Very busy, so be prepared to wait 15 mins at least at the peak times.
The front of house manager has an excellent computer system that sends you a text so you can go away and come back when your table is ready.
Must Visit if in Dublin!",Date of visit: February 2017,Bunsen,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
Delicious village pub grub,"For a town of 600 people, this little village delivered the best fish and chips that we had in entire trip to Ireland.
Fresh, crisp and tasty. The service was sensational and the manager/owner made us feel right at home with the locals and the locals made us feel right at home in their pub. Great experience, a true memory!",Date of visit: February 2017,The Blue Bull,4,"Sneem, Ireland"
Hidden Gem outside of the bustle of NYC City Centre,"This hotel was so incredibly beautiful and true to its style. From the rooftop bar, to the ballroom to the Captains Suite, it was truly like being aboard the Titanic.
The staff and concierge are next level. They looked after us every step of the way and nothing ever felt like it was too much.
As a frequent traveller, it is much more effective for us to pay for things before we arrive, just so we know that it is done and we don't have to worry about it. This hotel doesn't offer that and that for us was its only downfall.
Suitable for all ages, the smaller cabin rooms have a bit of a hostel vibe to them as they are quite small - this may not suit some travellers who opt for the smaller room size. It is QUITE small.
One thing I do remember clearly is that some days the cleaners would do an amazing job and then others they would forget our room. Didn't bother us to much, but for some this may be an issue.
Location is in West Village and I am so glad we didn't do the NYC city thing, because the outlying suburbs are where the real NYC flavour comes in and the restaurants and nightlife around this area and further down in Soho and Nolita is just excellent. The Jane gives you that closeness to both city and outer suburbs.",Date of stay: January 2017,The Jane,4,"New York City, New York"
