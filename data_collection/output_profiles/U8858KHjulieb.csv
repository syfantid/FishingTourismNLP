Taverna Glaros - an amazing food experience,"We stumbled upon Taverna Glaros whilst making our way to Red Beach, Santorini. We were greeted by a lovely woman and were made to feel very welcome. We ordered the marinated mussels, seafood spaghetti and homemade chips. It was amazing. After travelling Europe for three weeks we knew a good meal when we had one. To top it off, she gave us her homemade dessert that she has served to her customers for the last 32 years. I devoured mine. When in Santorini next time, we will definitely go back.",Date of visit: July 2017,Taverna Glaros,4,"Santorini, Greece"

Magnificent fishing tour,"Our fishing tour with Giorgaros Fishing tours was perfect. Anthi and Thanos and the crew were amazing. They encouraged us to help bring in cages and fishing nets full of fish and we were educated on the different species caught. They were well equipped on board with fishing rods, snorkeling gear and towels and they took us to a glorious swimming spot. To top off the tour, they prepared the catch and made us the most exquisite lunch. They are beautiful people who did all they could to make us feel comfortable. I highly recommend them and we will most certainly sail with them again.",Date of experience: July 2017,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Stunning Sunny Villas,"We have spent the most glorious week at Sunny Villas in Santorini. Our ""cave"" was spacious and we had stunning views from our balcony. The staff here do everything possible to make us comfortable. Our room was serviced everyday. The location is perfect, close to restaurants, supermarkets and bars.

Close to Eiffel Tower,"This hotel has a great location. Our room was not overly spacious but it had everything we needed and we had a view of the top of the Eiffel Tower.
