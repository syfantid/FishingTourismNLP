A valued recommendation,"Got recommended to go to the distillery j’y our rep Stephen Kealy who was very pationate about the tour. The man was right 25€ well spent where Karl with a “K” shared his passion of whiskey with a very good touch of humour. I would definitely go back in a few months to see how this new tour evolves.

Thank you Karl for a fantastic experience",Date of experience: November 2019,Roe & Co Distillery,4,"Dublin, Ireland"

5*+++,"What an amazing experience I had with la bombona! I met with one of the instructors, JB, in town the day before telling him about my regrets of not having had time to go diving or plan it for my last day which was coming.

JB fit me in his day without any problem.

Rocio welcomed me with a smile the next day, fully aware of me coming and helped me with the paperwork and training required.

The whole team (offices, instructors, boat crew...) is super approachable, friendly and entertaining. Genuinely smiling and proud of what they do this team deserve their top rating on TripAdvisor

Thank you for a great experience

St valentine in the honeymoon suite,"We traveled to Cyprus for st valentine s day and had one of the best experiences we have ever had. Upon booking we left a comment sharing that we only see each other occasionally due to our long distance relationship. Comment was not wasted.

Upon check in George greeted us with a big smile and welcomed us in a friendly and professional manner, speaking English perfectly acknowledging my non greek speaking girlfriend. He dropped a hint about a potential surprise in and with our room which we quickly realise upon opening the doors to our honeymoon suite.

The room was amazing! Vast and well decorated, satisfying our needs for the stay with not only one but 2 balconies. The jacuzzi in the room was the cherry on the cake!

At the bar and the next day at the restaurant for the valentine s meal, Maria took really good care of us. Recommending us a bottle of Cypriot wine which we enjoyed so much, we ended up buying 3 of during our stay. An asset to your team.

The valentine s experience was amazing! We had a fantastic 5 course meal with champagne. The food melted in our mouth! Tastiest food we have had in ages! The live music was an extremely beautiful touch, bringing our already fantastic experience to another level!

Breakfast was from another world. A vast selection of food and drinks with friendly team members who could not stop giving us the perfect level of attention. From team members, to chefs and management!
Having the opportunity to meet the head chef in the breakfast room was also a great touch. Stelios was humble and appreciative of the feedback received about his breakfast and st valentine s meal.

Once again thank you very much Hilton Cyprus for making our stay magical!",Date of stay: February 2018,The Landmark Nicosia,4,"Nicosia, Cyprus"
A 5* experience!,"We stayed for 5 nights at the Hilton park Nicosia where we were welcomed prior to our arrival with a lovely email asking for our arrival time to make sure our arrival experience was great.

Upon check in we were welcomed with a smile and explained about it room type.
Our room was vast with a beautiful view of the garden side of the hotel. A large balcony allowed us to enjoy the rainy day and enjoy a bit of fresh air after a long day traveling around the island. The refurbishment did not affect our stay at any time which was even more satisfying as we had some minor concerns.

The free parking is a great touch with plenty of parking spaces to spare.

Evelina was the one team member that made our stay. Friendly, approachable and extremely knowledgeable of the city, Éveline offered some some great advise on places to go including a dinner option at Zanettos a popular local taverna. Best recommendation ever! An asset to your team!

Panagiotis in the bar was simply amazing! Couldn’t fail to provide us with impeccable service. Smiling and understanding of our needs treating us as “executives” at all time. Our gold membership was felt appreciated by him as he wouldn’t miss an opportunity to thank us for our loyalty in the way he approached us and the language he used! Well done panagioti!

Finally thumbs up go to dimitris your porter who did a great job keeping us busy and entertained while we were waiting at reception.

Breakfast at the Hilton Park was amazing! A fantastic selection of food covering all our needs and cravings!

Well done Hilton Park Nicosia for a great experience.",Date of stay: February 2018,Hilton Nicosia,4,"Nicosia, Cyprus"
More than a tree in the park!,"A fantastic getaway with my girlfriend in a wonderful doubletree property. 5 star service on the edge of Hyde park. The team could not have been more attentive. From .check in by friendly Altadena, to inquiries answered by Jade, to a pint served by the very social Alessandra.
I highly recommend this property in terms of location, bedrooms and service! One of my newest favourite properties in London !",Date of stay: January 2018,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Hyde Park,4,"London, United Kingdom"
A 5* service with 6* experience if that is even possible,"Went to the Conrad Dublin for our graduation and was welcomed by the fantastic concierge at the entrance. Martin was exceptional! Great company when outside and amazing personality. Check in experience was amazing! Ivana offered an express check in and even offered to show me to the room. A great stay with a fantastic private evening organised for us with an even better night sleep.
Will be back soon!
Thank you Conrad Dublin.",Date of stay: April 2017,Conrad Dublin,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
5 star experience in 5 star hotel,"From check in to check out I have but one thing to say... WAW!
Evi at check in was absolutely amazing! friendly, professional and international! We quickly realised we were both greek and continued the conversation in our own language! Evi welcomed me with a big smile, and made me feel comfortable right away. Making me valued by mentioning to me she personally took care of my complimentary HH upgrade was the cherry on the top!

The Executive Lounge is a unique experience. George seemed quite busy but found time to interact.the complimentary drinks were flowing and constantly topped up.

The room was amazing! vast, well lit with a great design... not to mention the bed! Most comfortable night I have had in ages!

Breakfast experience was unique! a vast selection of items in a huge breakfast room!

Hilton Bankside, I will be back!
Thank you for a fantastic experience!

A lovely stay with the family!,"Checked in by yonut, a man with an amazing personality making us feel welcomed right away! A trainee? I don't think so! Great understanding of the HHonors benefits satisfying our upgrade request right away! Another thumbs up to Sebastian who also interacted with us and my brother s baby during the check in process.
The service was so great I booked a second room for my second brother the next evening. Late check in not requested but fully accepted. Yonut st check on ully understanding my brother need of a good breakfast before flying out of Dublin and starting work in Switzerland right away, he suggested a slightly more consistent breakfast for him. My brother, an ex-hospitality professional was impressed and happy!l with his breakfast.

Thumbs up to these two team members and thanks for making our stay confortable and memorable!",Date of stay: November 2016,Hilton Dublin Kilmainham,4,"Dublin, Ireland"
