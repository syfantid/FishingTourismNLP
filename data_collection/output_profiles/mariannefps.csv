It is the first time I have,"It is the first time I have been to La Turka and we had a lovely evening. I was pleasantly surprised to find they were continuing to eat out discount for a Tuesday night. The atmosphere was great, our server Alex was extremely attentive and had excellent attention to detail and service and the food was delicious. We will definitely be returning.",Date of visit: September 2020,La Turka Bistro Monton,1,"Eccles, United Kingdom"
Great food and drinks and also doing takeaway in lockdown,"This is a brilliant little bar and restaurant with character and banter and fantastic wines and a great Sunday roast or breakfast bagel or sourdough pizza. Currently a great place with lockdown for take away food, wines and beers. Would highly recommend",Date of visit: May 2020,The Chorlton Green,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Misrepresentation on menu and poor customer service,"The menu looks full of fantastic options but when I ordered a Naked Hero Burger with an extra patty and sweet potato fries for 14 pounds which was advertised as two 6 ounce burger patty’s, this arrived as one leaf of lettuce with two tiny patty’s that looked smaller than a McDonald’s cheese burger patty and there was no way either were 6 ounces. When we brought this to the attention of a member of staff he said that they make them themselves and thus they are squashed down. There is absolutely no way there was 12 ounces of meat there and the plate of food that cost 14 pounds was the size of an average starter and I left hungry to go and get a meal elsewhere. I will not be back.",Date of visit: January 2019,Expo Lounge,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Educational and Interesting day out,"It was amazing how many different artifiacts are on display and how much there is to see. It was a really interesting and fun, not to mention free, afternoon out.

The gem of the Northern Quarter,"I went on Sunday and had the Meat platter which was delicious and a great portion for the price. The music was brilliant and just to my taste. The staff were friendly, welcoming and attentive. Callum who served us was full of banter and good tips of Manchester site seeing for my family that were visiting. I loved the decor and the outdoor smoking area was great. We will definitely be back. It definitely seemed the busiest place in the Northern Quarter and I always go somewhere busy as I know it must be good. Thank you and see you soon.",Date of visit: June 2018,The Patron,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Definitely worth visiting while in Athens!,The museum has an incredible collection of artifices that have been lovingly restored. The museum has actually been built on stilts over a current excavation site that they are still excavating and the plan is that soon you will be able to tour this under the museum as well. It gives you a great idea of the history of Athens and the progression from 500 BC until 400 years ago. You cannot take photos inside and it cost us 5 euros a ticket. We spent about 2 and a half hours there.,Date of experience: June 2018,Acropolis Museum,1,"Athens, Greece"
"Good value, well located and very friendly","Clean hotel, very friendly and helpful staff, great roof top bar and restaurant with views of the Parthenon.

Great decor and the coolest spiral staircase the tastefully decorated and really clean bathrooms. We did not eat but the food looked mouth watering my delicious. We will be back before the end of our 3 days in Athens ❤️",Date of visit: June 2018,If Espresso Bar,1,"Athens, Greece"
Paradise on Earth,This honestly was a real patch of paradise with the white sand and turquoise sea. It was also not overly populated and you can walk 10 minutes without seeing anyone (we were there from February 24th to March 2nd so may be different in peak season). There are 3 different bars and restaurants that I saw that are about a 15-20 minute walk along the amazing beach from each other. No pictures can do it justice. It was between 25 and 28 degrees sunshine every day we were there. I would also recommend trying to get out on a boat and do some snorkelling.,Date of experience: February 2018,Treasure Cay Beach,1,Great Abaco Island
Fantastic fun team day out,The Crystal Maze experience in Manchester exceeded my expectations. Our Maze master Foo made the whole experience fun but intense and really made us work as a team. It was great fun and worth every penny and I would happily go again with friends,Date of experience: November 2017,"The Crystal Maze LIVE Experience, Manchester",1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Beautiful building and history,The library has stunning interior and exterior architecture and is lovingly maintained including the original books. Definitely worth a visit,Date of experience: November 2017,The John Rylands Library,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Nice place for a quiet drink and some pub food,It is a very nice little pub and they have recently renovated it and there is a great outside seating area with heaters. The staff are great and it is dog friendly. My only point to be improved would be the menu choices for me personally as there were not a large amount of dishes I wanted but I also know that is probably just my personal taste,Date of visit: November 2017,Ye Olde Cock,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Fantastic service and excellent venue for private functions,"I had a small pre-wedding reception in the Pen and Pencil's private room on the 16th of September with between 40 and 50 guests. I had pre-ordered bottles of prosecco and ordered a selection of canapés both savoury and sweet from their menu. We were allowed in early to decorate and bring the wedding cake and it was a beautiful venue.
The staff were absolutely brilliant and attentive as well as having good banter and fun.
The food exceeded my expectations and was plentiful and excellent quality and presentation. Nothing was too much to ask and they really made our day special. I would highly recommend this venue to anyone. I also have previously attended quiz nights at this venue which were always a great night out.",Date of visit: September 2017,The Pen and Pencil,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Fantastic educational day out and so much fun!,"I went on the fishing trip with Captain Dimitrius and Effi and it was an incredible day out. They are fun, friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had the best time. You get to observe and join in on the pulling in of the fishing nets seeing how it works behind the scenes while learning so much. You then get the freshly caught fish cooked and salads from Efi's garden and it was the best meal I have had in 2 weeks in Kefalonia. My father wanted to do some fishing with a rod and while this is not normally part of the trip they accommodated this and he caught two fish. You also sail to see the beautiful coast lines and hidden beaches. I cannot recommend this trip highly enough for a great day out. Thank you so much for a great day!",Date of experience: September 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fairytale wedding venue and most caring and attentive service of any hotel I have stayed at in the world,I had my wedding on the beach of this hotel and the reception at the hotel and it exceeded all my expectations. Thanks to the wonderful Anastasia and her husband who were in touch with me constantly for the 2 months leading up to the wedding the wedding and reception and whole day was a fairytale day. The staff are so caring and attentive and generous and I honestly can say I have never seen better service or generosity and attention to detail in any 5 star hotel I have stayed at in England or America. The hotel is sparkling clean and the beauty of the views and location and the interior design is second to none. I cannot thank them enough for making this the most special day in my life.,Date of stay: September 2017,Regina Dell Acqua Resort,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic day excursions to Zante and Ithaca,I have done both of the excursions to Ithaca and Zante the they really are incredible.

I would highly recommend them,Date of experience: September 2017,Captain Vangeli's Special Cruises,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Another fantastic trip with George and Mikos!!!!,"I went on our first off road mountain tour with George and Mikos in May this year. We came back to Kefalonia for my wedding this week and I booked the off road tour for 10 of my wedding party. They made the day incredibly special and slightly altered the tour so it was different. We climbed the last 20 minutes to the top of Mount Aenos, went to the ghost village where Captain Corellis Mandolin was filmed and saw some of the most breathtaking views I have ever seen. They are fun and a light lunch is included thanks to the lovely Irene. Thanks again for your incredible hospitality and knowledge in sharing your beautiful island with us.",Date of experience: September 2017,Outdoor Kefalonia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Best bar is Skala Kefalonia with fantastic and attentive staff, outrageous cocktails, great music and brilliant fun","I got married in Skala Kefalonia and most of my wedding party stayed at the Captains House hotel connected to this bar. While we have tried other bars in the area no other bars came close to the great service, great music, outrageous cocktails and good fun we had here. The staff were so attentive and towards the end of my stay the staff presented me with a beautiful Kefalonia necklace as a wedding present. I would happily say this was the best bar we found in Skala in two visits to the island. They even bought little shots of orange juice for the kids when bringing complimentary shots so that they could join in. Thank you for your care and hospitality!!!!",Date of experience: September 2017,Captain's Bar,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Annie and Kostas made our wedding day more perfect than we could ever imagine!,Annie and Kostas did the wedding planning for our beach wedding and were there for every question and sugggestion for 2 months leading up to the wedding. They made it the most beautiful and it was like a fairy tale. It was set up on the beach with the most beautiful flowers and arch and a guitar and mandolin player. They also assisted in making it the best reception possible. I would highly recommend using them to plan your wedding and you will not be disappointed.,Date of visit: September 2017,Andromeda Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Perfect service and amazing location,"I have traveled all over the world and have to say that Kefalonia is the most beautiful place I have visited.

The Livadaki Village hotel is an amazing hotel with the most spectacular views of Skala.

It is a family run hotel by he lovely Sofia and she works so hard to make your holiday special.

Nothing is too much trouble whether it is making sandwiches if you are missing breakfast for an early excursion, first aid, contacting your travel agents, giving you maps of the best places to go and generally being there from morning till night with a friendly smile on her face. It really feels as if you are being welcomed into her home.

There is free wifi and a great breakfast for the price that you pay.

The rooms are spotlessly clean and serviced daily.

The hotel is beautiful and although a 7 minute walk from the beach and a 12 minute walk from Skala village, the views and the beautiful walk make it much better than staying on the sea front or in the village. It is so peaceful and you have the mountains and sea views.

I will definitely be returning to this hotel again and again.",Date of stay: May 2017,Livadaki Village Hotel,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Beautiful sandy beach with clear blue water,The beach is stunning and sea great for swimming. You can hire a sun lounger for 3 euros a day and will get local cafe coming to take drinks orders and bring you drinks. Loved it,Date of experience: May 2017,Skala Beach,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"

The best excursion we did of 4,We did the off road tour with George and Mike and it was an incredible end to our holiday. They were so much fun and took you up into the mountains 500 metres above sea level for the most breathtaking views. I won't give away the surprises they have in store for you but I cannot urge you enough to take advantage of this tour. It is excellent value for money and lunch is included.,Date of experience: May 2017,Outdoor Kefalonia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Nothing was too much to ask,"I stayed for one night for a business trip.

The best night I have ever had!,"The new Lost and and Found Knutsford is an incredible venue. Everything is beautifully laid out and the staff are incredibly helpful and friendly and are there to get you anything you need before you even have to ask. The Manager even and over to see how our food was and ensure we were happy with the service. The food was excellent value for money and delicious. The service was extremely fast and although it is an incredibly upmarket venue there is something for everyone and we had an amazing time with excellent music, an array of delicious cocktails and a brilliant atmosphere. I could not recommend it highly enough and am looking at booking this as a wedding venue and also as a venue for future business events.",Date of visit: October 2016,The Lost & Found,1,"Knutsford, United Kingdom"
