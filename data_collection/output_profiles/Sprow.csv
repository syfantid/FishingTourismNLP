What a day,"My wife and I met up with Efi and Dimitrious at the harbour lovely couple. My wife use a stick but it was not a problem she walked on fine. We were offered coffee tea or water with dry snacks which were very tasty. We set of to bring in the nets and hauled in lots of fish a big catch see photos. We then went to a place were the seals hung out but none there ((nature is not on demand) maybe next time we go? We then dropped of at our first cove for a swim beautiful beach, then on to the final beach which had clay which is claimed to knock 10 years of your age two of us did it twice but our wife’s looked disappointed when we swam back. Back board Ffi and Dimitrious had been busy cooking our fresh fish we caught with great salad, Greek potatoes lots of lovely fish wine and beer flowed there were four couple who never met before but we became friends.

Poor,"First of this is the first negative review off any Premier Inn as I use them quite a lot and generally find them very comfortable with good staff however, I checked into this hotel Monday 20th March, check in was fine not the usual pleasant and friendly greeting I am used to at a Premier inn. The hotel and rooms are very tired and in need of attention no problems. I went down to eat in the restaurant to be greeted by good evening sir there's a forty five minute wait in the restaurant and thirty minute wait in the bar, so faced with that I went to the bar very pleasant young man at the bar took my order and was very helpful I ordered a starter and fish & chips. I didn't have to wait very long starter was fine, however the fish and chips were absolutely disgusting soggy batter the fish was horrible the waiter came and cleared the table and asked if every was ok and I informed him of the issues with the fish and he said he would tell the chef. Will not be going any were near this establishment and I am think of avoiding Premier chain which I stay at least once a week?",Date of stay: March 2017,Premier Inn Carlisle M6 Jct44 hotel,1,"Carlisle, United Kingdom"

1st Class all the way,"All we can say is this was a fantastic experience, not your average hotel with rooms starting from £600 per night, you certainly get what you pay for the room (suite) we had was two rooms together with a fantastic bathroom with large bath (jacuzzi) walk in shower/wet room. A full living room with mini bar drinks serving area large flat screen TV. The restaurant we dined in was in the main hotel area (not Gordon Ramsay) food and service were excellent but I must you do not need to e on a budget starters tasty but priced around £26, mains from £28.

Excellent Service,"We have ate at the cottage loaf on a few times now and on every occasion the food and service has been spot on!

Excellent Day Out,"Half a mile all within the excellently restored docks area, there are at least three free to enter maritime museums, the Tate art Gallery (also free) the Beatles Experience (chargeable but well worth the cost) shops, cafes, statues, architecture to please and offend almost everybody, an opportunity to Ferry cross the Mersey and so much more. We spend a half in the dock area once a month and thoroughly enjoy the venues echo arena, a good mile walk along the front is good exercise with good views of the Mersey & yachts apartments.

We would recommend this restaurant great location for doing other things.",,Prezzo,1,"New Brighton, United Kingdom"
Average,"This is a clean but clinical restaurant but on a very busy main road and it has a cafe feel about it you can take your own drink but if you forget there's a Sainsbury,s opposite. I would say the food is average we ordered Chicken Madras, pilau rice.
The madras tasted powderer he rice was a small portion but I suppose sufficient it was our second visit as the first was when they did a buffet which we didn't like this at all. We will probably try once again to give them the benefit of the doubt but will leave it for another couple of months, and if its not right we will send the food back.",Date of visit: October 2012,Vindaloo,1,"Birkenhead, United Kingdom"
Confusing Prices?,"We were invited to a Wedding so well in advance we enquired about booking a room and were told special reduced wedding price of £82 reduced from £87, when I checked the web site a golf package (without the golf) was £69 for both of us, and when I rang back and queried this I was told that this receptionist couldn't view the web, when eventually someone rang me back I ad to say we weren't there for a wedding and requested the web site price of £69 I was told that this was a mistake after debating this for several minutes I got a price of £75 I found out later that other people had got rooms for £65??? The rooms were very tired and small with mould all around the shower base so we didn't bother, also if you want to check in before 2 p.m. you have to pay another £10 we were lucky as a) the wedding was @ 3.30 p.m. and we live within 10 miles of the hotel. On a positive note the wedding was perfect and the rooms were decorated to a high standard, also the food was excellent quality with large potions. If we are invited to another wedding we go but pay the Taxi's.",Date of stay: February 2013,Leasowe Castle Hotel,1,"Leasowe, United Kingdom"
