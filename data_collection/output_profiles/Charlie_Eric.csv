Day fishing,"This is the second time this year on this boat and yet again it did not disappoint. The crew were helpful and did their best to ensure we had a fab day, even providing light refreshments for the duration of the trip. The fishing was slow but we still managed to get a couple of tuna, some red snapper, puffer fish and the highlight of my day (as I hooked it!) A little stingray!

Brilliant day - would highly recommend it!",Date of experience: October 2018,Escualo Fishing Lanzarote,4,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Birthday trip,"The roooms are clean, well refurbish anded well looked after. Cleaners work non stop.

Food - good choice excellent idea having food cooked to order and to your liking for all meals.
Varied menu for dinner including themed menus e.g. Asian Italian Creole Arabian

Bar - on the small side toilets outside near pool
Quality of entertainment varies
Clean tidy
All staff very helpful polite courteous
Especially Pedro (Love his special hot chocolate at the end of the night!)

2 pools one for kids predominantly on main complex. Smaller pool located in complex over the road deeper and more adult friendly

Location is up a steep hill at the top of the old town so not great for those with poorer mobility but taxis are reasonably priced.

This is the second time we have visited this year. Another fantastic week - a huge thanks to all the staff!",Date of stay: October 2018,THB Flora,4,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Weeks holiday,"Check in was easy and the man on reception was very friendly. We had a room in the main block on 3rd floor which was very spacious, clean and well-maintained. Food was typical all inclusive but on the whole of a good standard.
However, 2 points that really let this hotel down are:-
1. Entertainment on an evening is sadly lacking in all aspects. Area for this is simply rows of chairs with no tables or bar area and can at times smell of the drains. Significant improvements needed with this for it be on a par with other hotels of similar standard.
2. Check out procedures need looking at. We checked out at 12pm and had our AI bands removed despite not actually leaving resort til 9pm. We were told we could use the restaurant for 15euros a head plus drinks. However, after paying for AI we would have expected this to continue until pick up not be cut short by half a day, especially when we checked in late(After midnight) due to a flight delay.

Overall, after a good week here really disappointed with the final day hence why the rating is not higher. Both points definitely need looking at by management in order to keep this hotel competitive.",Date of stay: August 2018,Filerimos Village Hotel,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Wow!,"Great food, great service and great views!!!!
Spag bol was tasty and mussels are to die for!
Lovely little restaurant well worth a visit",Date of visit: August 2018,Delight Restaurant Lindos,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Greek night,"Food great. We shared a mushrooms starter and a special pizza with wedges as a side. More than enough for two!!!! Eric had the Apple pie - beautiful!
Great night although the music is not necessarily typical Greek but still great. Owner is fully involved and very entertaining- expect to be dancing from early on. A great place to eat and socialise- not to be missed!!!!",Date of visit: August 2018,Pegasus Restaurant,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Day out in Rhodes,"After booking 2 days before, we did this half day fishing/swimming/BBQ trip this morning.
What a fantastic day we had! A short tour round the harbour in front of the old town, followed by a couple of hours fishing after which the captain steered us towards a small bay where we got the chance to swim/snorkel in some beautifully clear waters. Meanwhile the crew had prepared lunch (see photos) which included BBQ'd fish caught by people on the boat. Presentation was original to say the least.
A great day out with 3 trips rolled into one. Good value for money and well worth a visit.
Thank you captain and your deckhand",Date of experience: August 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Lovely stay!,"On our arrival check in was quick and easy. Despite arriving after the restaurant had closed, we were informed that the kitchen had plated us a cold platter up - a welcome surprise after a long journey.
Our room was clean and spacious. It was cleaned daily - we had no complaints! The food was plentiful and varied. However it was nice to have the option of the other 2 restaurants. Pool areas were clean and maintained daily. We didn't use the outdoor pools due to holidaying at the end of October but did use the indoor pool which was lovely despite jacuzzi / sauna not always working.
We found staff to be polite and courteous although special mentions have to be given to staff working the lobby bar - Marco for his music, Ivan for his juggling, Wayne for his excellent service and top of the list has to be Massimo for his friendly conversations and his 'special' cocktails!
Thank you for a lovely holiday.",Date of stay: October 2017,LABRANDA Riviera Hotel & Spa,4,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Well hidden secret!,"Wow - where to start?
On arrival we were greeted by the lovely lady on reception who immediately ushered us into the restaurant for something to eat despite it being after serving hours. We were then escorted to our room by the ever cheerful, smiling Moris who was only too happy to give an overview of the facilities. A few quiet drinks on the balcony before an amazing nights sleep in the biggest bed we have ever seen! Our room (511) was clean and serviced every day and was perfect for our needs.

The food throughout our stay was plentiful, varied and catered for just about every taste you can imagine, the highlight definitely being the Greek night. The staff throughout the hotel couldn't do enough for you and worked hard throughout the whole day in every area of the hotel. The pool area was wonderfully maintained as were the grounds. No fights over sun beds and there was always enough for everyone, no matter what time of day. The free shuttle was a bonus and allowed us to get out and about. The local bus to Zante town was an experience but well worth it for the price - we used it three times over our 2 week holiday. The local area was beautiful and the scenery stunning.
Entertainment was of varying quality and initially the nights without entertainment were quiet but this was soon rectified with music being played in the background through the sound system. The Greek night was definitely the best, especially seeing the staff join in and let their hair down.

Overall, the staff, the hotel, the food and the location were outstanding and we loved the remote location which allowed us the perfect relaxing holiday that we were looking for. Definitely not the kind of place to go if you want other pubs and shops as there is none of this on site or nearby (apart from a gorgeous little taverna 10mins down the road!). The sstaff were absolutely amazing - always cheerful and friendly and couldn't do enough for you - an absolute credit to the owner for creating this hidden gem which overflows with friendliness and a relaxing atmosphere. We will definitely return at some point in the future",Date of stay: August 2017,Keri Village & Spa by Zante Plaza,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
