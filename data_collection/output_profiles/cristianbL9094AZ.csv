Fishing,"I spent two weeks in Kos and I booked a fishing trip before the arrival, via facebook. I enjoyed it so much, the price was good for a 4 hour trip and we caught great fish so I rebooked a second trip with captain tasos! We liked that we took the fish and a restaurant in the nearby cooked it for free. Thank you!",Date of experience: July 2019,Captain Tasos,5,"KÃ³s, Greece"
