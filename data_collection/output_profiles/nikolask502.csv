A must do experience,"I did the Fishing experience with friends and family a few days ago. Mr Nikos and his wife are very friendly and know all the good spots and beaches! Mr Nikos picked us up from Kimolos at exactly the agreed time, we went and gathered the nets, and then went to a number of beaches for swimming. Mrs Froso cooked the fish we caught and made and excellent soup. I would totally recommend Mr Nikos and the Fishing Experience that he offers.",Date of experience: August 2019,Milos Fishing Experience,5,"Milos, Greece"
