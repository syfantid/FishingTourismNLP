Great morning tour,"We had a brilliant time on this cooking experience. Kevin was a fantastic host, asking us what we would like to learn to cook! We made chicken pho, spring rolls, Vietnamese pancakes & egg coffee! Will definitely be cooking this when we are back home. Would definitely recommend. Thanks Kevin!",Date of experience: March 2020,Rose Kitchen,5,"Hanoi, Vietnam"
Fab day out!,"Thanks so much! We had a great time this morning. Efi went out of her way to help us at every point, even offering to book us a ride back to Agostoli with her friend afterwards as we had no transport. The day was amazing and the food delicious. We would love to come back again and would recommend to anyone. 11/10 x",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
