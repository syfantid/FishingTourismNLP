Great relaxing day out,"Amazing day out with Antonia and Michalis. First great fishing adventure; getting to see the nets being brought up and the catch of the day. Very fascinating for kids. Afterwards you stop by in a small secluded bay where you can swim and jump off the boat while Antonia prepares the most amazing fish-based lunch.
We found it really interesting to have time to speak to Antonia too and ask her about local customs and other things we'd been wondering about Greece and the islands.
A great day out that I can warmly recommend!",Date of experience: August 2020,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
