Nice trip but expensive,"Positives:
Lovely hosts
Short boat trip
Experience traditional Greek fishing boat
Good variety of fish caught
Hosts knowledge of the fish
Swim and mud spa
Great food made with lots of homegrown produce

Negatives:
Following part of their working day-bringing on 2 very long nets.
Not compulsory to help untangling fish from net, but this part takes a long time and a little tedious.
Only 12 cans of beer on the boat, no wine(plenty of water).
Longlines can be used but only if you bring your own! I’m on holiday mine is at home.
Snorkels and masks provided but first beach is long straight with only pebbles of various sizes, no fish or anything of interest to see.

A few in the group don’t eat much fish normally and not familiar with while fish. Struggled de-boning the fish at dinner.

Unfortunate for us:
Didn’t see any seals, dolphins or turtles.

Overall:
Some good moments but a bit dull at times. At 75euro It felt very expensive for what we experienced.",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,3,"Cephalonia, Greece"
