Great,"Took my partner here for her birthday dinner, she had the carbonara which she said was beautiful but far too much ( not a bad complaint) , I had the lamb chops, again beautiful, but I could have done with another 1 or 2 , she finish of with a black coffee , and I had my favourite cocktail, a caipirinha, much cheaper than buying one in the hotel.",Date of visit: October 2019,Helios Cafe Bar Restaurant,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Excellent,"Stayed here for 10 days beginning of October, absolutely brilliant, the rooms were spacious and very well presented, the pool is huge and even had disabled access, with a ramp running from the hotel and another one running into the pool. The resort has 6 bars , though I think one of the pool bars is for smoothies and the like for the kids. The Resturant again is huge, and even has an adults only section, I’m a very fussy eater, but I had no problem here, the food was excellent.
We did have one problem with one of the waitresses in the cocktail bar , we had been sat for about 10 minutes , and she served 2 or 3 groups who came in after us, at this point my partner went and spoke to her , when she eventually came with the drinks, she’d got the order wrong , so we just upped and left , she was the only problem we had on the whole holiday.",Date of stay: October 2019,Amada Colossos Resort,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great day out,"Took this trip on a Friday before leaving, . Started off with a trip round the bay to see the old town , then headed out to sea , where we spent an hour going round in circles so the skipper could trawl for tuna . Spent about 2-3hours fishing then headed into a bay for a swim and lunch , personally, I’d have preferred to spend more time fishing , it’s a fishing trip ???",Date of experience: October 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great day out,"Took this trip on the Saturday, got picked up from the hotel, which was handy as there was a group of 8 , us and 6 from Israel , proceeded down the coast stopping off at a few places en route , our final stop before lunch was a place where the Mediterranean meets the Aegean it’s quite a place , took a little trip off road to get lunch , a home made shack on the coast, nothing much just bread, ham , cheese etc . Continued up to a village in the mountains for free samples of summa , olive oil , nuts , . Then headed back to the hotel , was sort of boring after that , but all in all a good day out",Date of experience: October 2019,Rhodes Land Rover Safari,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Ok,"It’s a pretty little bay , but not unlike the rest you see on any of the boat trips . Supposedly named after his role in zorba the Greek",Date of experience: October 2019,Anthony Quinn Bay,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Welcoming,"Went in here on a Sunday morning for a coffee, and the little old lady sweeping the floor welcome’d us with a “calimera” and a hand shake, made to feel welcome before we’d even sat down , had intended to go back one evening for a meal, but never got round to it",Date of visit: October 2019,Castellan Restaurant,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great,"Went here for a full fry up as our hotel didn’t do meat and I was pining for a full English/Scottish , it was great just what I needed, and the owner was very friendly and helpful, even tried to find the cigars I was looking for.",Date of visit: May 2019,Murphy's Restaurant & Bar,4,"Kusadasi, Turkey"
