Nice view but avoid using the bathrooms,The atmosphere is nice and the prices are trying to reflect some kind of better service and good quality. The toilets tho are shocking. You can easily catch diseases in there...,Date of experience: January 2020,Thessaloniki Concert Hall,4,"Thessaloniki, Greece"

Awesome birthday present activity,"We really enjoyed our tour with Nuria, the motorbike was really really cool, we got to see places that otherwise we wouldnâ€™t have due to time constraints and distance and the weather helped a lot as it was quite comfortable the whole ride in the middle of winter. All in all I definitely recommend it!",Date of experience: November 2019,Private Barcelona Tour by Retro Sidecar,4,"Barcelona, Spain"
Fantastic experience of real Egypt,The Cairo tour was amazing with great exposure both in the modern culture as well as the ancient history and the antiquities. The Giza tour was breathtaking with the camel ride being the highlight of the day. The papyrus museum was informative and the lunch was great. Finally the Cairo museum in the end was really impressive with treasures and historical information. The time dedicated to each activity was plenty and every single one of our questions answered. Overall it was a great experience that I definitely recommend.,Date of experience: October 2019,"Giza Pyramids,Sphinx & Egyptian Museum",4,"Cairo, Egypt"
Best boat trip ever!,"We are a couple that really enjoy boat trips and we have tried several in many countries. These guys were the best ever. Very knowledgable of the area, excellent command of the language, friendly professional and polite. The food on the boat was simple yet amazing, the most fresh fish you will ever get, with tomatoes with the best aromas and local tsipouro. It was a traditional fishing experience with swimming in private beaches with crystal waters and snorkelling. Absolutely recommend it! I wish there were more than 5 stars!",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing trip and Boat tour,4,"Nea Iraklitsa, Greece"
