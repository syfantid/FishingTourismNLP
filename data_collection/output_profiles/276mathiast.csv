The undisputed highlight of our holiday!,"My girlfriend and I were looking for day trip by boat and got in contact with Georgios a few days in advance. Due to a cancellation we were lucky to get on the trip, so I recommend you to book the trip from home or at least a few days before (just to be sure).
Georgios and his team took good care of us and we enjoyed a very nice meal consisting of the fish we caught, a fresh greek salad, spaghetti with squid and cuddle fish and bruschetta. We also got to swim and snorkel in the beautiful waters of Zakynthos.

Don't hesitate to book this trip! It's ideal for both families and couples.

Georgios is very easy to get in touch with, so if you have any questions, he will be happy to answer them.",Date of experience: August 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
