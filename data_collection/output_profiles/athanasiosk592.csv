Best day of our vacations,"Me and my girlfriend wanted to have a private relaxed day around Skiathos and the nearby islands as too take fool advantage of the beauty Skiathos has to offer but is accessible only by boat. I spoke with Dimitris on the phone and he was very clear on what our day plan would be.
We met in the morning and the amazing experience began! Got our coffee, relaxed on the comfy seats and sailed away... We visited many beaches, caves where we got to swim all the way at the end, had amazing food and live sea food from the bottom of the sea!
Dimitris is an amazing captain! We had a lot of fun, interesting discusions and info of the places we visited. After the trip we had a coffee all together and Dimitris helped us taking our staff to the main port as we were going to the mainland the same day and got us a souvenir!!
Also it was just me my gf and 2 Italian friends, so it was really relaxed. As I noticed other boats were really crowded and commercial.
Next time we will be in Skiathos we will definitely join him for another day in paradise!",Date of experience: August 2020,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Bad food bad service,Ordered a cheeseburger and the meat was worse than Mc Donalds. I ended up having only the potatoes. My friend ordered a salad and the cucumber was rotten so had to order something else.,Date of visit: May 2018,Restaurant Toni,1,"Vienna, Austria"
