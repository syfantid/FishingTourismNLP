A unique day out,"We spent a great day with Antonia, Michalis and their daughter Nicky. Antonia replied to our initial enquiries almost immediately and made us feel like friends straight away. We enjoyed coffee and cake (which was delicious) and then set off on our adventure with our crew mates. After a short sail out into the turquoise sea, we stopped and Michalis and Mustapha began to bring in the fishing nets they had put out very early that morning. The nets were about 2 km long and the catch was amazing; red snapper, scorpion fish , lobster (and others I can't remember). We then swam in the clear waters off Spartia while Antonia prepared a feast of freshly caught fish, potato salad like I've never tasted and a massive salad. We had wine from their own grapes and a huge dessert which I can't remember the name of but it begins with K!! We had such a lovely day getting to know everyone and we were sorry to say goodbye. If you want to try a day trip which is unusual, try this, you won't be disappointed.",Date of experience: June 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely house close to the town centre,"We've just returned from a two night stay at Alpine Lodge; it's a great place to stay, only a few minutes walk into Buxton town where there are plenty of places to eat, yet set in a quiet residential area. Our room and en suite were nicely decorated and spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable. Jean was so friendly and welcoming and made us instantly at home, the cooked breakfast was excellent and I especially enjoyed the fresh fruit platter - strawberries, kiwi, melon and figs. Thanks Jean for a lovely stay.",Date of stay: September 2016,Alpine Lodge Guest House,5,"Buxton, United Kingdom"
