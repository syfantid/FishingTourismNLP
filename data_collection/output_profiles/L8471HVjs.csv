Would not change a thing! Great even if you do not fish.,"I booked this tour on July 10th with a bunch of people who were not terribly keen on going fishing, but wanted to go on a boat for the day. I can tell you that by the time we were done, everyone was ecstatic that they booked. You do not need to fish if you do not want to, rather once the fishing is done, you can lounge around on the boat or hop in the water. Captain Anthi and her crew went out of their way to make sure we were happy. Even if we did not catch as many fish as we did, it still was WELL worth the money. We ended up catching an octopus, squid, barracuda, hermit crab, eel, prawns and about 60 or so additional fish. The crew cooked the food up and we had more than enough to feed us 10x over. I signed up for TripAdvisor so I could leave this review. Well worth the money!",Date of experience: July 2018,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Great Tour,"My wife and I went on this tour as we did not just want to hear the history of Athens, but also the mythological stories. Our guide (a younger lady whose name eludes me) kept us very entertained. I think 4 hours was just the right amount of time and all our friends that we had take the tour after us also enjoyed it.",Date of experience: July 2018,Athens Highlights: a Mythological Tour,5,"Athens, Greece"
AMAZING! The top activity we booked.,"My wife and I booked this along with several other tours (which were also great). However, this class was something different that will stick with us. I know other reviews mention how it feels like family, but it really does. Fofi is so nice and walks you through everything. Rather than just go through the motions, she genuinely seems to care if everyone is having a good time. The food was incredible and we made way more than the 12 of us could eat (something like 6 or so courses). This is an absolute must and well worth the money.",Date of experience: July 2018,Greek Small-Group Athens Cooking Class & Dinner,5,"Athens, Greece"
Incredible experience and highly recommended,"My wife and I booked 2 hours with Max. There were other tours for less money, though I liked that we would receive edited photos. Max was incredibly easy going and knew exactly where to take us. He was very engaged and seemed like he was having fun taking the photos. They turned out absolutely amazing... so much so that our friends were a bit upset that they did not book him as well.

For 2 people, 2 hours was more than enough time (at least in Santorini) and we had time to change outfits 3 times. I cannot vouch for every photographer, but I highly recommend Max Kapetanakis.",Date of experience: July 2018,Personal Travel and Vacation Photographer Tour in Santorini,5,"Santorini, Greece"
