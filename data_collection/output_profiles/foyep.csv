Great day !,"We enjoyed a wonderful day with Anthi and her crew ( and her sister's gorgeous new born baby and beautiful little boy ) . She was such a lovely and kind person ( especially when I felt a bit sea sick ) and looked after us very well . Most of all though we loved to hear about her fishing family , how they live , what they do and feel her passion and pride . I loved the fact she was the captain ! We caught fish , swam in the sea and had a perfect meal of fresh fish on the boat . Met some other lovely people and had a very memorable day .
Do this if you like the water and want to do something authentic . A great day .
Thank you !",Date of experience: June 2017,Giorgaros fishing tours Santorini,4,"Santorini, Greece"
