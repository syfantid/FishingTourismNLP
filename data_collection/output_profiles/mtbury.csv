A great activity in Seville,"We have done several Urban Adventures tours in different parts of the world and they have all been superior in quality and interest, always with that bit of difference, an edge, never boring. This tour, described as Seville Traditions and Trends on their website, is a good example. Sara is an enthusiastic artist and loves directing you through the artisan part of Seville where you get to try practical glassmaking in an artist's workshop under their careful supervision. Everything is craft, including the brunch at a lovely small restaurant producing good quality food that is perhaps somewhat different from the typical Seville tapas bar. A good walk to Triana market and the tiny Flamenco theatre and a private Flamenco lesson by an interesting professional Flamenco dancer in a rehearsal room with tales of growing up in a Flamenco family all ably translated by Sara. Finish by relaxing with a drink and tapas in a historic bar. Take Sara's recommendations here, the food is excellent! A really good way of spending five hours and definitely a highlight of our visit to Seville.",Date of experience: September 2019,"Seville's Food, History and Flamenco! by The New York Times",4,"Seville, Spain"
A really good trip,"The trip is exactly as described by others, it is interesting and a great escape from the crowds of Dubrovnik, I would say a preferable activity to walking the walls. You need a reasonable level of fitness because there's a distance to paddle. I would have given this 5 stars except for two criticisms. First it would be good to note that the beach is very pebbly and difficult to walk on. The organisers should recommend that pool shoes or similar are worn that you can snorkel in. Second, some of the snorkel equipment needs maintenance, we were given snorkels that wouldn't attach to masks for instance. I'm not saying we didn't have a great time, we did and I would highly recommend it, just that the organisers need a little attention to detail to rate the experience excellent.",Date of experience: August 2019,Adventure Dubrovnik - Sea Kayaking and Snorkeling Tour,4,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
A perfect day,"We (a family including 3 boys aged 2, 7 and 8) organised a private trip with Antonia who picked us up from our cruise ship and took us to the small fishing port 20 minutes away. The children were fascinated by the process of hauling in the nets and the lobsters and fish that were collected. We then went to a small secluded beach and swam in the lovely clear water from the boat to the beach where we built sandcastles while Antonia prepared lunch, which was just excellent, up to the standard of anything we had on the cruise ship.
The boys had their first experiences of fishing, free swimming in the sea and eating lobster.
All in all it was a perfect day, the highlight of a cruise that was in any case wonderful.",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Consistently fabulous,"This is the second time we have taken the 5 hour private tour, this time with Kate. We had such a great time when we did this previously, I wanted to repeat the experience. When I booked, I forwarded the notes that they had provided us with on our last visit so that we could do some new things, but we had our daughter and her husband with us on this trip which was their first time in Hong Kong so it didn't matter that we repeated a few things.
Kate was really well prepared and was eloquent and interesting throughout as well as being very personable and friendly.
The providing of a personal note afterwards detailing all of the places visited and suggestions for further exploration is a particularly nice touch.
I would have no hesitation in recommending hello Hong Kong to any visitor to Hong Kong wishing to really find out any aspect of this fascinating city. This is a guided tour of the highest quality.",Date of experience: March 2018,Half-Day Private Custom Tour of Hong Kong,4,"Hong Kong, China"
Very basic hotel and expensive,"This is a basic hotel, basically a bed, a telly and a shower. The room was cold when I arrived because the heating only works if there is a key in the switch. Having said that, and it is in the City, but I paid £175 for one night, and when I got up in the morning, the shower had no hot water. The bed is small but comfortable. The breakfast is adequate. The staff are nice and helpful, but if you want to stay for more than one night, I could not advise it. My room was perfectly clean. The rooms are small, too small for two people. For the money, you expect more.",Date of stay: December 2017,"Point A Hotel, London Liverpool Street",4,"London, United Kingdom"
Great location but not top notch,"This hotel is located perfectly for a visit to Reykjavik with all of the main points of interest within easy walking distance. The staff are friendly and willing. The hotel is clean, warm and mostly comfortable. It can be a bit noisy. There's a very pleasant atrium that goes up to the third floor, our room was at the top of the atrium and overlooking the front street, we were disturbed by noise from both, and the room walls are thin. Saturday night was as in every city in the world, the noisiest. The staff quickly sorted out our complaint about ill fitting sheets, but they couldn't do anything about the dreadful signal reception on the TV, apparently a common complaint while we were there, and the wifi reception was very poor in our room at the top of the house. The worst problem that definitely couldn't be solved and may have been peculiar to our room was that the shower was virtually unusable, being a flexi-attachment to the bath taps but under the sloping eaves of the roof,so you couldn't stand up and use the shower. All hotels in Reykjavik are expensive, but we felt the price charged here warranted a somewhat higher standard of accommodation. However it has great character and is in the very oldest street in the city. The hotel itself is built over a Viking long house, which you can visit.",Date of stay: January 2017,Hotel Reykjavik Centrum,4,"Reykjavik, Iceland"
A big tour with an intimate atmosphere,"We did the Golden Circle tour with Aevar. An 8 hour tour starting 2 hours before dawn (it was January!) could be daunting and to do this on a big bus would have been unimaginable. The roads are narrow and icy at this time of year but Aevar coped really well and we felt safe throughout. To be honest the time flew by. There is adequate time at each stop and Aevar took great pride in getting there just before the big tour buses. We were blessed with good weather, but the interesting commentary, personal stories and little touches like samples of local food and sweets made this a great day. In the Winter, make sure you go dressed with decent boots and of course thermals. Gullfloss especially is a bit of a hike and it was very cold.",Date of experience: January 2017,Your Day Tours,4,"Reykjavik, Iceland"
You must do this if you have children,"In fact... you can ONLY do it with children! As an adult spectator, we were as fascinated by the obvious enjoyment of the children as with the novel, well prepared and engaging content. Stunningly simple idea to entertain children for 3 hours with a wonderful and enthusiastic guide (Tati) who absolutely related to all the children who ranged from 4 years to 12 years old. Why aren't similar activities available in other cities? Activities ranged from colouring the Catalan flag, ordering sweets from a shop in Catalan, skipping down the street missing the cracks to move from one location to another, visiting the museum of the giants and spotting the animal gargoyles on the cathedral, all of which were done in an entertaining way. Our 4 year old grandson only began to flag near the end and we were pleased to stop at to end next to a café.",Date of experience: June 2016,Runner Bean Tours: Kids & Family Walking Tour,4,"Barcelona, Spain"
Great way to see Marseille for active cruisers,"We booked this tour while on a cruise. The company picked us up at the cruise ship together with another family that had also booked and took us to the start point where we were issued with bikes, safety helmets and given instruction. We were then treated to a tour of Marseille, often in traffic but often away from traffic and always safe. Marseille is hilly and the ebikes help a lot! One of the bikes developed a fault going up one of the steepest hills, fortunately one of our party was fit enough to ride up without the power and the guide fixed the problem at the next stop. That could have been an issue though and is the only reason I have given 4 rather than 5 stars to this tour which I would do again on any future visit to Marseille.",Date of experience: June 2016,E-Bike Tours Marseille,4,"Marseille, France"
Perfect Introduction to Hong Kong,"I recommend that you do the private 5 hour tour on your very first day in Hong Kong. Jess met us at our hotel and she escorted us on the Star ferry, showed us how to use the public transport and then we walked to so many iconic sights of Hong Kong. She is so knowledgeable about the history, the people, the place. You will see famous places and not so famous places which you would never get to without an experienced guide. Our tour took us over lunch and she took us to a traditional tea house where we were the only western faces, but it was OK because Jess could help us get food, and very good it was too. This is your private tour and Hello Hong Kong have very good communications leading up to the day of the tour to make sure they know what you want to get out of the experience. Not only that, when we said there were certain things we would do on our own subsequently, Jess followed up with very detailed instructions of how to do those things and included a few more suggestions as well. Thank you Jess, without your tour our visit to Hong Kong would have been nowhere near as successful and interesting as it was.",Date of experience: December 2015,Hello Hong Kong: Private & Small Group Tours,4,"Hong Kong, China"
Surprised there are no reviews,"This is one of my regular restaurants. If you want to get in ""on spec"" at the weekend, forget it, you will not get a table without a wait, but you can ring and book ahead Full of local people. Really good food, and a wide range of ""English"" pub food. Quick, friendly service.",Date of visit: October 2012,The Horseshoe Inn,4,"Radcliffe, United Kingdom"
awful breakfast,"As a Holiday Inn, you get what you expect in terms of rooms - clean - comfortable - a better than average hostelry. O course it's the people that work at the hotel that make the difference, and we came across that member of staff that can really spoil a stay, and it seemed the management just shrugged their shoulders as if to say there was nothing they could do, so the management is weak. The bad guy was the duty chef in the breakfast room who basically couldn't cook. Eggs were being fried in 2 inch deep oil and of course were coming out dripping in oil, overcooked and disgusting. When we complained we were told the manager was ""over there"", but the manager explained that she could get eggs cooked in a different way but she had tried before and they will just be served burned. The correspondant who went across the road for breakfast probably made a good choice!",Date of stay: October 2010,Holiday Inn Oxford,4,"Oxford, United Kingdom"
Not the best,"There's a much better and more intimate japanese restaurant in George Street. The Sapporo is too big. It's OK, no more than that.",,Sapporo Teppanyaki - Manchester,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Disappointing,"We went to Tailors on the recommendations here. I have to say that the standard of cooking was much poorer than we expected. Tasteless Pork Belly. Nothing to recommend. No alcohol free options other than water, juice or coke.",,Tailors Restaurant,4,"Warwick, United Kingdom"

Second worse Hilton I ever stayed at.,"I like Hiltons normally. The standard is predictably competant. Stayed at the Hilton Warwick Easter bank holiday weekend. The staff seem to have apoor attitude, lots of problems at the hotel but the staff unable to solve them. A lift partially working caused more problems than if it had been switched off. The car park (which you pay for extra) barrier had to be manned for one day but could only be operated via a radio link, which was unmanned at the other end. Good buffet breakfast but terrible dinner. I had Duck Confit descibed as with a black cherry sauce, came with a beef flavoured gravy and 2 black cherries. The hotel was nearly empty on Sunday and Monday. I wonder why? The only worse Hilton I stayed at was the Hyde Park in London which is truly awful.",Date of stay: April 2010,Hilton Warwick / Stratford-upon-Avon,4,"Warwick, United Kingdom"
