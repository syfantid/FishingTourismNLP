A wonderful experience,We had a great time fishing with captain Giorgis!! He's friendly and full of life! We learned about different types of fishing and the different species of fishes a fisherman may attract with them. We enjoyed our selves on his boat and had a lot of fun!,Date of experience: August 2016,Captain-Giorgis Paros,5,"Paros, Greece"
