Great service,"Staff are excellent, friendly and attentive, especially Viktor in Lounge Bar and Mustafa in Beach Bar. Eyhan also went out of his way to make sure we were happy. Hotel spotlessly clean thanks to hard working cleaning staff, great food and lovely rooms. Beach a bit of a letdown but pools lovely and refreshing.",Date of stay: September 2020,Numa Bay Exclusive,1,"Turkler, Turkey"
Fantastic ice cream & friendly customer service = Fabulous!,"Took my nephews for an after school treat, Georgia made us so welcome and took time to talk to the boys when they asked about the trophies on display and how the ice cream was made. We had pancakes, waffles and divine ice cream and we were then joined by other family members who delighted in their choice of dessert too. We will definitely be back soon. Thank you for a fun and tasty afternoon.",Date of visit: January 2020,Pinks Parlour,1,"Bognor Regis, United Kingdom"

Look no further for relaxation & warm welcome,"Spent a fabulous week here, The English owners do everything to ensure you have a relaxing, chilled out holiday. Plenty of loungers, good size pool, spotlessly clean throughout the small complex. Someone is always on hand, good local knowledge, arranged taxis and breakfast, snacks and of course drinks all available from a well stocked bar. Best of both worlds if you stay here, we had ducks visit us 1 day from fields behind yet you are only a very short walk into town and the beach. Went for a week but felt as if I'd had a relaxing fortnight. Wonderful!!! Will definitely be back next year.",Date of stay: September 2017,Zantegarden Apartments,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"

Friendly & Welcoming Hotel,"Stayed for 3 nights in triple room. Was clean, beds very comfy and we had balcony too. All staff were friendly, extremely helpful and very pleasant.

Easy to get to Old City from Lapad on local bus or taxi.",Date of stay: April 2017,Hotel Perla,1,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
Exhilarating walk of walls,"Took about hour and half to walk walls, take photos and admire incredible views all around and over Old City. We did complete circuit in 1 go, but you can do a section at a time to break it up as lots of steps and spectacular views to take in.",Date of experience: April 2017,Walls of Dubrovnik,1,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
Walking History,"History at your feet. Can tour in a day or less. Fabulous buildings, intriguing history from centuries ago to more recent events. Game of Thrones fans will recognise some locations. Plenty restaurants and bars to relax and enjoy the atmosphere.",Date of experience: April 2017,Old Town,1,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
Relaxing getaway,Resort set in beautiful gardens approx 20 minutes walk to Burriana beach and slightly longer to the Balcony de Europe. We had booked a studio apartment but when we arrived were given a 2 bed apartment with terrace. A bit dated with the kitchen area and bathroom needing most attention but it was spotlessly clean throughout and beds were comfortable and bed linen clean and good quality.,Date of stay: April 2017,El Capistrano Nerja Guy P. Way,1,"Nerja, Spain"
View!,Fabulous views and a popular destination for holiday makers. Was a little windy the day we visited but we watched waves crashing below and admired the all round views of coastline.,Date of experience: April 2017,Balcony of Europe,1,"Nerja, Spain"
Nerja caves,We visited on a day when weather wasn't too good. Well priced attraction and the rock formations are incredible to see. The caves are huge and you have a guided tour with special points of interest pointed out to help you fully appreciate what you are looking at. Well worth the visit.,Date of experience: April 2017,Cueva de Nerja,1,"Nerja, Spain"
A great day at the beach,Walked to the beach which is downhill but well worth the walk. You can drive as well and there was plenty of parking available. Good choice of bars and restaurants as well as sun loungers to hire for the day (around 3.5€ per day). We had a tasty paella for lunch at 1 of the beachside restaurants which was very reasonably priced. Very relaxing vibe here with some balinese beds available to hire and at one end of the beach and Thai inspired restaurant bar with good coffee and service.,Date of experience: April 2017,Burriana Beach,1,"Nerja, Spain"

Chilled Afternoon with Nephews,"A haven of gorgeous greenery in the centre of seaside Bognor. Lose yourself in this park for an afternoon, take a ride on miniature railway in summer, relax with a drink and delicious fresh cooked food in the modern cafe. Had great fun with nephews playing football and looking at the wildlife. Followed by tons of 'wear them out' action in the large adventure playground, swinging like monkeys on the climbing structures. We skipped the putting green this time but we will definitely have a go next time.",Date of experience: September 2016,Hotham Park,1,"Bognor Regis, United Kingdom"
Best bakery & coffee,"Warm, friendly, most hospitable owners. Had great tasting lunch here and cakes are amazing.

Best coffee at An Bang",Date of visit: August 2016,7 Son Bakery & Coffee,1,"Hoi An, Vietnam"
Relaxed and easy,"Had great time here with friends and our 2 teenage boys. Will definitely be returning soon. Plenty to see and do, from the buildings, market, river, restaurants, tailors and endless choice of restaurants. A must do when visiting Vietnam.",Date of experience: August 2016,Hoi An Ancient Town,1,"Hoi An, Vietnam"
Great service,"Excellent tailors, my husband had 2 suits and a shirt made, my son had a suit too. The staff really pay attention to detail and there is plenty of styles and fabric to choose from.",Date of experience: August 2016,Bebe Tailor,1,"Hoi An, Vietnam"
"Relaxing, safe beach","Visited several times, if you pick a spot in front of 1 of the many restaurants you can get the loungers free if you order drinks or food & most restaurants have toilets & showers you can use for free. or walk to the quieter end where the loungers are cheap & you can order cold drinks and food for a good price. We went to the right and the last set of loungers, got a great price and had lunch delivered to us from 7 Son Bakery & Coffee. Some small jellyfish but they didn't stop us enjoying a swim to cool off. There are the usual beach sellers, but if you're not interested in buying whatever they are selling, they soon leave but they are great fun and very entertaining.",Date of experience: July 2016,An Bang Beach,1,"Hoi An, Vietnam"
What a let down!,"Was invited as part of a Hen Night, to see Adonis cabaret then stay for club. Some good things, performers were most friendly out of all staff, show was fun. But Bar staff were grumpy, looked miserable, plastic glasses, cocktail alcohol mix poured out of plastic jugs, not sure what was in it! We were making a good night of it although drinks are quite pricey. But what spoiled the evening for me was 2 of our group left to buy some cigarettes, the doorman said ""it's ok, I'll remember you girls"" to readmit but when they returned they were forced to pay £15 each to get back in & rejoin our group. I tried to speak with the 'Management' about this, but he was rude, arrogant, dismissive & surly. We'd already paid to get in the club, had stamp on hand but he wouldn't budge. I felt so aggrieved at these 2 being cheated, as did rest of group, 3 of us left as we didn't want to give the club anymore of our money. I will not return. Also, beware everyone thinking of going, don't leave & return as it will cost you £ even if the doorman says it's ok. Worst club staff ever. Adonis lads had better customer service. Aquarium staff should all go on a Customer Service course as soon as possible.",Date of experience: May 2016,Club Aquarium,1,"London, United Kingdom"
