"It’s a beautiful setting,","It’s a beautiful setting, a stylish great restaurant with good service, we had the fillet steak, the salmon and the duck... all were a bit dull and lacked seasoning which were a real shame. For the price we would have expected better, the front of house is spot on but the kitchen really let them down.",Date of visit: August 2020,Summer House,1,"Perranporth, United Kingdom"
Sitting outside in one of,"Sitting outside in one of the beach huts we found the food excellent!! We had a wrap, chicken topped nachos and a ploughman’s and they were all well proportioned, reasonably priced and incredibly good! The service is very good too.",Date of visit: August 2020,The Tywarnhayle Inn,1,"Perranporth, United Kingdom"
World’s smallest 6oz burger!,"I know under COVID we all make allowances and try to support local businesses, but... when you have to ask if they have sent a child’s burger instead of the £11.50 6oz burger with an extra £1.50 processed cheese slice and the waiters reply was... “I know...you should see the fish and chips..”

For your information, the tomato at the front was a small cherry tomato and the bun was the size of a MacDonalds happy meal.

Eat out to help out should not mean 50% smaller meals.",Date of visit: August 2020,Fort Inn,1,"Newquay, United Kingdom"
Hygiene..... no stars.,"Wanted to try this place for a while after reading reviews. The staff member clearing tables and pushing the waste down in the bin then served food to customers. We watched him do it repeatedly whilst queuing to order. After the fourth time we walked out. The guys in the kitchen maybe wearing gloves but hygiene front of house is just as important!! Will not be going back!!
Very disappointed.",Date of visit: July 2019,German Doner Kebab - Preston,1,"Preston, United Kingdom"
Portreath’s best kept secret.,"I’m a coffee addict, you could say a coffee snob... but damn this little cafe built into the sea wall with picnic benches overlooking the beach serves some of the best fresh coffee I’ve had all week! The breakfast butties are pretty special too. If you get chance to stop here for an hour to watch the waves and have a cuppa it is well worth the effort! Enjoy!",Date of visit: June 2019,Portreath Beach Cafe,1,"Portreath, United Kingdom"
Excellent food and service,"Even on a busy, sunny Friday night they catered for our table of 12 brilliantly. The food... especially the fish and vegetarian options were incredibly good. It’s clean, good quality and very helpful service but book in advance if you can, otherwise you’ll be getting fish and chips from its takeaway... which is no bad thing because they are also the best we’ve ever had! Enjoy!",Date of visit: June 2019,The Atlantic Beach Cafe & Bar,1,"Portreath, United Kingdom"
Cheeky Lunch!!,"I don’t give praise easily. BUT... this is the most authentic Italian pizza I have had in the country. Even the starters were simply delicious. And the service is second to none!!

I cannot believe a place as good as this exists just down the road!!!",Date of visit: April 2019,Farina & Co. Catterall,1,"Catterall, United Kingdom"
Symi Boat Trip Five Stars,"This has got to be one of the best value boat trips on Rhodes, a full day out for two adults and our daughter for 50€. The boat had plenty of space with a bar for the 2 hour trip to Symi... and what a beautiful place that is... set in the hillside, the multi coloured houses around the port is stunning... we wandered for three hours and had lunch in a taverna. The back on board to sail round to St. George’s Bay where had plenty of time to snorkel.... all in all a fabulous day with great friendly staff looking after you. Thanks guys!!!",Date of experience: May 2018,Half Price Tours,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
A real shame,"Over the years, I’ve stayed at the Sun on business and found the rooms to be fantastic. I liked it so much I brought my husband back for a wander around Lancaster and to stay in what was... my favourite place for a valentines treat. I guess my luck ran out. It was the smallest standard double I’ve ever had. The TV didn’t work and it was just all a bit tired and shabby. The staff are forever friendly and tried to fix the tv and the breakfast (which cost extra) was as good as always but I doubt I’d go back. Real shame, still my favourite pub in Lancaster though.",Date of stay: February 2018,The Sun Hotel & Bar,1,"Lancaster, United Kingdom"
My favourite restaurant in Preston by far...,"If you want a genuine Italian family restaurant, with really good quality food and not need a second mortgage this place is for you. It's not just the pizza and pasta that's great, the rump steak with gorgonzola (or Marino's house sauce if you are my husband) with fresh vegetables and amazing roast potato's (£12.50!), or the chicken ala crème, or the meatball's or the garlic bread - what ever you choose you will love. Just wear expandable pants or take the rest home.... It gets busy in the evenings so you are best booking, but my favourite time is a rainy Sunday afternoon...
We now go here more than anywhere else in Preston... so see you there!",Date of visit: January 2018,Marino's,1,"Preston, United Kingdom"
Pleasantly surprised!!,Yes the rooms are small... and you can hear the street... and the clientele coming back late at night... but.. I have stayed at many four or five star hotels in Manchester centre that have been the same and are NOT as clean or have such great staff! This is where you come to rest your head... not a luxury hotel to hang out in... it’s just like the airline but better service... will definitely use again.... and again... and again. Well done guys x,Date of stay: December 2017,easyHotel Manchester City Centre,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Wow!,We’ve been to the restaurant loads of times but today we picked up fish and chips from the chip shop at Atlantic. Quite possibly the BEST FISH AND CHIPS IVE EVER HAD!,Date of visit: November 2017,The Atlantic Beach Cafe & Bar,1,"Portreath, United Kingdom"
Amazing place,This is our second visit to the Residence at Gwel An Mor. Five of us comfortably fit in the three bedroom contemporary lodge with hot tub. It’s just stunning accommodation with a view of the sea. The facilities are excellent and welcoming whatever time of year you come. Quite possibly the nicest place we have ever stayed in Cornwall x,Date of stay: November 2017,Landal Gwel an Mor,1,"Portreath, United Kingdom"
Best meal in Hayle!,"This tiny place looks like nothing from the outside and even tinier on the inside but what an amazing surprise! Both of us had burgers and they were incredible!! As good as any we had in California earlier this year!! Why? Because the lovely lady running it was a genuine Californian!! From scrumptious burgers, that really tasted of steak to authentic taco’s this place is the real deal! Please go.... I guarantee you won’t be disappointed!! Can’t wait to go again x Thanks Felicia!",Date of visit: November 2017,Harry's Cali-Style,1,"Hayle, United Kingdom"
Disappointing,"Had high hopes for this place after reading the reviews but unfortunately we were disappointed. It’s a traditional pub with a restaurant in the next room. The food, a seafood platter, two lots of fish and chips weren’t great. But the Ceaser Salad and scampi were ok. The fish salmon and white fish on the seafood platter tasted like they were microwaved and the fish and chips had cold peas and the fish very thin and mostly batter. Apart from that the service was good and tried to put everything right. Lovely people just go for a drink instead!",Date of visit: October 2017,The Basset Arms,1,"Portreath, United Kingdom"
Blimey! Now that’s a burger!,"Coming from up north where burgers are made by the handmade burger company or Almost Famous, this little pub gives them a run for their money!! Fantastic chunky chips, scrumptious burgers and well, quite frankly... great service... what more can you ask for.

When you first walk in, don’t take first impressions seriously, it’s a bit bare and tired but the food speaks for itself. Nice one guys!",Date of visit: October 2017,Red River Inn,1,"Hayle, United Kingdom"
Perfect for Pirates,"You can’t beat an autumnal Sunday sat outside the Sloop come rain or shine, at this time of year it’s usually both!! Had a great afternoon and a warm welcome, aided by the mulled cider with rum. An absolute treat that not only tastes like heaven but also kills all known germs dead.

If you are in St Ives, you have to visit this 700 year old pub!!",Date of visit: October 2017,The Sloop Inn,1,"St Ives, United Kingdom"
Fantastic Fishing Trip,On our last day of holiday we decided to do a three hour fishing trip with these guys on Friday and I'm so glad we did. We had a great time and we're really looked after! It only cost 90 euro's for two adults and a child and was worth every penny. Thanks for making our holiday!,Date of experience: August 2017,Sostis & Saratonga Faliraki Fishing Trips,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Fab food!,"We visited this restaurant for the first time 18 years ago and ensure we always go back, wherever we stay on the island. There is a great fast food counter but next to it is the Roumeli 2 restaurant with a gorgeous garden. We have eaten at both and they are great!! Wonderful food and friendly service every time... make sure you get the spicy cheese dip!! Enjoy!",Date of visit: August 2017,Roumeli3 Restaurant,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Stick to the burgers,"Disappointed after visiting Betty's tonight. They brought the main course before the starter. The food was average at best... only thing worthwhile was the burger, the chicken and shrimp sandwiches were a letdown.",Date of visit: April 2017,Betty's Eat Inn,1,"Santa Cruz, California"
Soooo comfy!!!,After travelling Highway 1 for the last week this hotel was a pleasant surprise. The rooms are spacious and the beds are extremely comfy!! Perfect for a tired traveller. The guys on reception are extremely helpful and overall it was a very pleasant stay. You won't go wrong staying here. Thanks chaps!,Date of stay: April 2017,Kronborg Inn,1,"Solvang, California"
Quality food,Ate here last night. Food was good quality and service was ok too. I tried the danish sausage with mash and gravy. Very tasty.,Date of visit: April 2017,Bit O'Denmark Restaurant,1,"Solvang, California"
Don't let first impressions ruin it for you.,When we first pulled up we thought it was a run down motel in dubious area but we were wrong. Yes the Vagabond could do with a lick of paint but the room was clean and functional and the area... once you walk around is great!! Nearby you have a beautiful marina and great restaurants. The staff at the motel are friendly and helpful too. Situated away from the huddle and bustle of downtown San Diego it's a quiet base to relax. Also caters for those with pets and fishermen going on trips at the marina. I would definitely stay there again and next time I'm booking a fishing trip! Thanks guys!,Date of stay: April 2017,Vagabond Inn - San Diego Airport Marina,1,"San Diego, California"
Friendly safe area,Stayed here on a whistle stop tour of Hollywood. Staff were really friendly and the room with tile floors was clean and functional. Hollywood and sunset boulevard are a short walk away but luckily this motel is tookef away from the hustle and bustle of the crazy that is Hollywood. Breakfast is a cop doughnut and coffee but enough to get you on your way. Really liked the staff who were great. Thanks guys x,Date of stay: April 2017,Hollywood City Inn,1,"Los Angeles, California"
We liked it so much we came back,"Whilst travelling down from San Fran to San Diego we stopped off here at the hotel in Carmel. The rooms are a good size and the breakfast although basic continental had beautiful muffins and fresh coffee, as well as the usual waffle maker etc. The beds are comfy and the location is perfect to wonder round Carmel. We enjoyed our stay so much we came back on our second week whilst driving north. This time we upgraded to the suite with sea view. Really nice. Add to that fantastic staff who are helpful and friendly you can't go wrong.
We will be back!!!",Date of stay: April 2017,Carmel Bay View Inn,1,"Carmel, California"
