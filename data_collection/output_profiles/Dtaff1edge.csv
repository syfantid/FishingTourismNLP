The best most amazing resort,"The best most amazing resort I have ever stayed in,
We had a room with a private pool and it was fantastic the was even a waiter that brought you drinks to your own pool, there's plenty of bars around the resort and loads of restaurants in it aswell, 11 that I found including a pastry part that dose crepes and icecream untill 2 in the morning.
There are 4 a'la cart restaurants that you need to book and I suggest booking them as soon as you get there as thay book up very fast,
The staff there are excellent and so willing to help
We are 100% booking again for next year the beach bar is brilliant and there's always plenty of sunbeds available, also there's water sports including paragliding, jet skis and much much more, the kayaks and the pedalos are free to mitsis hotel customers,
If your a sports fan and want to watch your team then go to
""Bar Zone"" it's just outside the resort and it's got all the sports channels
Thay even opened the bar at 10 in the morning for us to watch the rugby world cup thay normally don't open until the night
