Fishing Excursion,This fishing trip was one of my favorite experiences in Santorini! It was very authentic and I felt immersed in the Greek fishing culture. Our captain was very interactive and explained each fish/sea creature we caught. She has an incredible and impressive life story. The meal cooked with our caught fish was impeccable! It was easy arranging out pick up from our air bnb. There were only 7 on the tour which made it very personable. Worth every penny!!,Date of experience: May 2019,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Eat and Walk Santorini Food Tour is a MUST!,After this experience my boyfriend and I decided the a food tour is a must at every location we travel to. Each place visited was chosen with thought and immersed us in the Greek food culture. Aristotle (the tour guide) is hilarious as well as a wealth of knowledge when it comes to the food of the island. I would encourage doing this tour early on in your santorini visit because it helped us to get the mag of the land and gave us some dining options for the rest of our time as well as a contact (Aristotle) for further questions. Portions were much larger than I expected so come hungry and expect to leave stuffed!! I would do this tour again in a heartbeat.,Date of experience: May 2019,Half-Day Small-Group Eat and Walk Santorini Food Tour,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Delphi and Meteora Tour,"Dimitrius made our visit to Delphi and Meteora an unforgettable experience. He was full of knowledge about EVERYTHING from Athens,Delphi, Meteora, and beyond. He had such a fun personality and gave the greatest recommendations. Anyone would be lucky to take a tour with Dimitrius!",Date of experience: May 2019,George's Taxi,5,"Athens, Greece"
