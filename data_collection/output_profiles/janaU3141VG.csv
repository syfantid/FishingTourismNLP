Great Day on the Boat,"We had a great day fishing with the captain Jannis and his wife Nancy. Not only we caught a lot of fish and calamari, also the whole day felt really familiar. After a short ride from Pythagorio habour we started fishing right away. Then we went to a really nice beach with epic blue water. After a dip in the water it we ate the catch from the day directly on the boat a box with cold beverages is also on the boat and for free. All together is was an amazing day.",Date of experience: August 2019,Samos Fishing Trips,4,"Samos, Greece"

Short trip,"The Hotel has good and not such good sides. The front desk staff (all of we meet!!!) Were really friendly and helpful.
The location of the house is great 2 minutes to tivoli and the main shopping street.
