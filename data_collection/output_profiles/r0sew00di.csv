Amazing Day,"We cannot recommend this experience enough! We were welcomed with coffee, juice and homemade cake and massive smiles. We helped take the fish out of the nets (maybe more of a hinderance), Efthimia, Mohammed and Dimitrios were extremely patient and very helpful, explaining lots of things as we went and were very attentive. This was followed by an amazing lunch, all cooked by Efthimia including the fresh fish caught that day, homemade lemonade, salt, wine, olive oil, fruit and veg and much more. We were part of a party of four and this is suited for all ages. I am pregnant and they were very caring and there was a young lad who was very keen on fishing so Dimitrios provided bate and helped with rods as well as letting him drive the boat (if that's the correct term!). Overall we could not fault the experience and it was a fantastic end to our honeymoon. Thank you so much!!",Date of experience: May 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Amazing food, slow service","We cannot fault the food, it was delicious but we were waiting a long time and had to order more bread to keep us going which never arrived and we were charged for. I would visit again but maybe at a quieter time.",Date of visit: May 2017,Maria's Taverna,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
