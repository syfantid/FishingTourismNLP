A fantastic fishing adventure!!!,"Fantastic trip with such friendly people! We took our three children; age 9, 2 and 1, we all had a brilliant time! Helping with the nets, holding the fish (our two year old daughter is blind, Efi helped her feel the different fish), Greek dancing on the boat (which our little ones loved) , letting our two year old help with prepping the dinner (which was so yummy), jumping off the boat to swim and having a go at fishing! Thank you to Efi, Dimitrios and Muhammed for such a wonderful day and helping us create such beautiful memories! We hope to be back one day soon!",Date of experience: August 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best place to eat!,"A lovely place to eat, just a short walk up the hill from the beach! Very family friendly and relaxed atmosphere. The food was so tasty and lots of it! All home made and lots of choice. Very reasonably priced. The seating is set in a lovely garden area with beautiful plants and a natural cool breeze helps with the heat. Very friendly and helpful staff, nothing was to much trouble! Highly recommend!!!!",Date of visit: August 2017,Jerry's Elliniko,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
