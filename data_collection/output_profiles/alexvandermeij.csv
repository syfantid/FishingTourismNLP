"Fantastic organization, great and active tour","Went with a friend and was super pleased. Crew takes great care of you with anything, beers and drinks on board. Fishing is great, the Captain grills your catch and other fish, pleasant snorkelling in a nice cave area, and overall a nice boat to spend a couple hours on. Highly recommend.",Date of experience: October 2020,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
"Great Omakase tasting, friendly atmosphere","Fantastic fresh fish, intimate atmosphere as the restaurant allows for max. 8 guests, friendly conversations with the Sushi Master. Creatively composed dishes, and the price-to-quality ratio was on point. However, difficult to obtain a reservation.",Date of visit: November 2017,Sushi Tetsu,1,"London, United Kingdom"
"Decent food, not worth the price. Good venue for pre-party","Dined in Hakkasan last Friday with the family; the food was decent, creative, came very quickly, but was not worth the price and hype that surrounds the Hakkasan chain. I recommend the restaurant for a friendly outing before a party - the restaurant plays quite loud deep house music with a DJ, there is a wide selection of alcohols, but it's not a place for family dining.",Date of visit: July 2016,Hakkasan Las Vegas,1,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
"Showmanship on point, magic un-Copperfield like","Visited Las Vegas last weekend, and decided to see David Copperfield's show in the MGM Grand. Considering it was Copperfield, I had extremely high expectations. David's humour was excellent, his showmanship made the audience burst out in laughter, but when it came down to the nitty gritty, i.e. the magic tricks (which we came for), we found it slightly disappointing. In total, he performed around 10 tricks, but mostly, the show revloved around the story of David's relationship with his father and an alien, which was a bit childish. If one wants to see many mind-blowing, unconventional magic tricks, one after the other, I recommend Lance Burton's show, whom I saw a couple years back on my first trip to Vegas.",Date of experience: July 2016,David Copperfield,1,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
First-Class Stay,"A very laid-back atmosphere in the hotel itself, very good apres-ski, excellent breakfasts with a wide variety and great dinners. The rooms are designer-quality, with a spacious bathroom and big balcony. The inside pool is very well taken care of, as is the SPA, with snacks and refreshments.
The service is very kind and helpful.
A great location, just 5min walk to the nearest ski lift, and with nightlife spots all around you, including in the hotel!

Truly a great experience. If skiing, I recommend Intersport Brundl for ski rental, which is just across the street.",Date of stay: December 2012,Hotel Post Ischgl,1,"Ischgl, Austria"
A great place for apres-ski,"Very ambient, with good drinks for good value. The music is not too loud and the decor inside is very nice and cozy.
The service is also very quick and efficient, always with a smile.",,Apres Ski Lounge Freeride,1,"Ischgl, Austria"
A great way to experience Chicago,"We had the morning tour that started at 10 and lasted 3 hours in total, including the Segway training. Everything was very organised and efficient, and our tour guide - Meadows was very funny and kind, as well as knowledgeable about Chicago's landmarks, which was a great plus.
The tour was around the Museum area, as well as the Soldier Field and the great fountain.
I highly recommend this tour to anyone who wants to see what Chicago has to offer, the fun and easy way!",Date of experience: August 2012,City Segway Tours Chicago,1,"Chicago, Illinois"
Sophisticated and very tasty!,"The restaurant is very comfortable and has a nice interior, with a full bar. The service is very helpful, quick and proactive.
The meals are delicious and the portions are reasonable. I highly recommend ordering Guacamole to the tortilla chips, as it is made fresh right at your table!
We have been there twice, and have not been disappointed.",Date of visit: August 2012,Cantina Laredo,1,"Chicago, Illinois"
Beautiful and fun!,"The beach is beautiful, with lots of space to relax. The waves can sometimes be quite powerful so parents with small children should be careful. There are nice restaurants in the vicinity, as well as great massage parlors. Highly recommended.",Date of experience: December 2011,Kata Beach,1,"Phuket, Thailand"
Artistic and a worthy experience,"A very artistic show, with some breathtaking moments. Funny from time to time, and I recommend this for families with 'smaller' children. Although the show is deligthful, the music in my opinion was too loud, and luckily I asked for earplugs upon entry.
Very pleased.",Date of experience: August 2012,Blue Man Group,1,"Chicago, Illinois"
"Made reservations, did not even get a table","We have reserved a table at the restaurant a day in advance for four. Upon entry, the entire restaurant was packed, and difficult to walk through. People at the bar with drinks were literally standing next to people trying to enjoy their dinner, which I find unacceptable. We informed the Maitre d' of our confirmed booking which we completed online. The lady said there were some complications with the reservation and we had to wait...an approximate half-hour which is ridiculous with a pre-made booking. We saw a table that was empty with a ""reserved"" sign.
We gave up and left and enjoyed dinner in a nearby restaurant that got us a table straight away.",Date of visit: August 2012,Gene & Georgetti's Restaurant,1,"Chicago, Illinois"
Great Steaks!,"We had a reservation and we were seated almost immediately. The service was quick, efficient and extremely friendly. The restaurant itself is elegant, with nice spacious tables and calm music.
Now to the main part - Steaks: The restaurant has a dry-aging policy which makes the meat extra-delicious and tneder. The Filet Mignon was perfectly prepared, and so was the Rib-eye! I recommend this restaurant to any steak lover. The restaurant is actually listed as one of the great steakhouses of North America.
Very pleased.",Date of visit: August 2012,Benjamin Steakhouse,1,"New York City, New York"
"Tasty and artistic food, but small portions","We came in without a reservation and although the restaurant was pretty full (Saturday evening), we were seated immediately. The service was nice and caring. Although the food was very tasty, the service was slow. The restaurant was awarded a Michelin star, which it deserved as the portions were nicely prepared, everything was fresh, but the portions were very small.",Date of visit: August 2012,Naha,1,"Chicago, Illinois"
"Not worth the wait, better alternatives","We got a VIP entrance where we could skip the line to buy tickets to the observatory. We certainly had no line, but the organization was poor as we asked for a QuickPass to the top, and instead we got tickets to some SkyRide attraction, which also was pretty cool. We did it all after 10 in the eveining to avoid crowds, but when we got to the 86th floor observatory, we were surprised by the amount of tourists up there. It was tough to get even one photo of the New York skyline from the Empire State.
A better view that was recommended by tour guides was the ""Top of The Rock"" observatory, which unfortunately we could not do.

Overall, it was not worth the wait, and I expected more.",Date of experience: August 2012,Empire State Building,1,"New York City, New York"
Beautiful place to be.,"A very nice and charming park located in the heart of Warsaw, Lazienki park was used as a retreat to the Polish kings in the past. Now a very popular destination for family walks, picture shoots and relaxation. Fitted with charming cafes and a great restaurant - Belvedere, where the ex-Polish President used to enjoy his lunches.",Date of experience: September 2011,Łazienki Królewskie w Warszawie,1,"Warsaw, Poland"
The best way to see Munich with the best tour guides,Lovely three-hour night tour of the Bavarian city Munich. Riding segways is really easy and fun. After a short instruction you master riding it and it is just simple pleasure. Munich by night is great and even better if you have an excellent tour guide like Tex. A funny guy from Texas with immense knowledge on the city with an unusual sense of humor. The price for the tour is well-worth it.,,Fat Tire Tours Munich,1,"Munich, Germany"
"Magical Hotel, Designer rooms, Excellent stay","The hotel itself is situated right next to the central train station which is comfortable for people arriving by train. The interior of the hotel is truly unusual. The rooms are quite small with a bathroom door that opens sideways. There is not much privacy because of all the glass in the room, but it's really not that bad. The beds are very comfortable and the room is very well-lit and decorated.
The breakfasts are very expensive, depending on your choice, prices vary from 29-49 Euro (Per Person). We found the prices very expensive so we decided to eat at a bistro across the road.

The Spa is also very well-decorated and well taken care of. There is a nice steam-bath and sauna, and a very uncanny pool with a sort-of 'labyrinth'.

The hotel staff is very helpful and professional as well as sophisticated.
This was truly a great hotel to stay in Munich.",Date of stay: August 2011,Sofitel Munich Bayerpost,1,"Munich, Germany"
"Amazing Pizza, Beautiful interior","The Pizza is truly amazing. Thin crust with the freshest toppings. Made in the real stone/wood oven. Service is very quick (we waited for four pizzas about 5-10 minutes). The interior is very cozy and Italian, although there should be more seating outside in the Summer. I recommend the Tiramisu for desert. Fresh and a big portion with the best taste.",Date of visit: August 2011,12 Apostoli,1,"Berlin, Germany"
Excellent Experience - A Must Do in Berlin!,"Totally the best way to see Germany's capital and learn lots of facts about it. In a matter of four hours, you will have visited the main city landmarks (such as Checkpoint Charlie, The Fuhrer's Bunker, The Reichstag and many more!) without breaking a sweat, as the Segways are in top shape, easy to use at all ages, and extremely fun! (Although they need recharging in the middle of the tour, when you take a break to see Checkpoint Charlie). The price for the tour is a bit pricy, but it was well worth it! I don't think I could be more happy from the tour, especially with such a great tour guide as MARRIETTE. I warmly recommend her. A great sense of humor combined with an astonishing knowledge of Berlin, its history and its people. She is of English origin, but knows Berlin inside out.
Truly a first-class experience with a first-class tour guide. The tour exceeded our expectations. 100% Fun mixed with a touch of Berlin's rich history.",Date of experience: August 2011,City Segway Tours,1,"Berlin, Germany"
