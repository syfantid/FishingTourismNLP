Amazing Experience!,"I had the pleasure of fishing with my family and Dimitri last summer and the one thing I can say is , incredible! We never thought that a few hours on a fishing boat could be so much fun and relaxing at the same time. My children keep asking when we will return for another trip and a day of fishing with Dimitri.

Class A service throughout and would recommend to anyone who wants to try something different on vacation.

Already booking our trip for next year and Skiathos Fishing Trips will definitely be in our itinerary!!!",Date of experience: August 2016,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"

The best service and staff in town,"I had the pleasure of hosting my daughter's baptism reception at the this restaurant. The food, service and friendly staff was second to none. Giannis, the owner, and his family have been operating here since I was a young kid. The very special night would not have been possible without the amazing food and service. Thank you Gianni my good friend!!! I look forward to seeing you again next year!!!!",Date of visit: August 2016,Aramis Cafe Pizza Snack Bar,5,"Skopelos, Greece"
