Fantastic Stay and Holiday,"We arrived at Thetis Hotel by the owners and were told out room (113) , set on the ground floor with our own little garden area , inside was a great surprise modern furniture, Nice comfy beds fitted with fridge , mini cooker , kettle , pots and pans etc, wardrobe , draws , dressing table even a hair dryer , a tv ,air conditioning and safe( at an extra cost ) good size bathroom with a shower that fully worked in its own shower tray and panel , modern sink.

DO NOT USE,"We booked a sailing trip via Thomas Cook with thassos sailing.com
They never attempted to get the sails out from the start, according to the skipper there was no wind, having gained my sailing qualifications there clearly WAS enough wind to sail.
They had no intention of putting the sail up on any of the three boats out that day with thassos sailing and in our opinion it is just a total con and rip off.
You can go on a boat trip which takes you to the bays to swim and gives you lunch with other boats for 25 euro. We paid 150 euro for the same trip to the bays with lunch and we booked the sailing trip as we wanted to sail and all we got for 150 euro was a motoring for the whole 7 hrs. My advice, save yourself the money and go on the other none sailing boats.
I say again DO NOT Use.",Date of experience: July 2019,Thassos Sailing,1,"Thásos, Greece"

Antonio even made some lobster up for my wife who didn't come as she gets travel sick on boats but LOVES lobster.
Whilst the food was being prepared it gave us all time to chill, swim , or fish , then after the excellent food still time to go for a swim again , before our return trip back to port
A long day ,so excellent value for the money and very educating for young children, youths and adults alike

The waitress are really friendly Too (especially a big thank you to Rov xx)

For those who are Greece lovers you will know that the standards are sometimes very basic, well not in this case. the room was of High quality, comfy CLEAN beds, bedding and towels changed regular, rooms cleaned every day apart from Sunday (even the cleaners need a rest LOL ) I had read a review that the food wasn't up to much , well we had the food and there was nothing wrong with it and for lunch the salads were amazing, breakfast if your B& B is the usual continental but with lots of choice.
the evening meal buffet is 12 euros for a 3 course meal or choose from the menu
( which is reasonably priced )
Bar Prices are reasonable too

If your worried about weight in your cases , they offer beach/pool towels for 3 euros a week
There is Air Con 5 euros, a safe 2 Euros and also a full size fridge , water from the shop is about 2.50 for 6 bottles small supermarket about ten minutes walk
There are a few things to do, but if you like to get out and about then you will need a car ( we used Stavros motors , just near the supermarket ) a brand new yaris 120 euros for 3 days comes with a full tank , you take it back with a full tank ,so you only pay for the fuel you use.
The hotel is built on a hillside and there is quite a steep walk up if your rooms are above half way ( so if you have trouble with stairs on steep hill let your travel agent know lower ground rooms if poss)

Places to eat in town :- Sunset ,Grill House steki, and the women's institute (upstairs near the main square over looking the small pier). All very good ,
Coco's at the end of the lane near the hotel also has very nice food , it seems very quite as its not in town so misses out on a lot of trade but give it ago ( nothing is too much trouble for her )
