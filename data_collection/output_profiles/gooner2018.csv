Fishing in Kateleios,"We had the most amazing day, welcomed with coffee and pastries, then set sail to gather in the nets, such an amazing experience, we cheered when we saw the first fish , which was followed by plenty more. Efi was so good explaining all about the fish, from snappers to lobster and making sure everyone was included. Off to the beach for a swim whilst the owners sorted the days catch. Home made lemonade . Then off to another beach for pre lunch swim and then the most amazing food ever, and all prepared onboard. It was the best day of the holiday. So many memories and laughs ️",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Work lunch,"We went for a office lunch today to our local, we had heard there were new owners! The meal was awful. The pizza was a very thin base and the topping of tomato paste and cheese was nothing special. The baguettes were served with a rather limp looking salad, slightly burnt and uninspiring. The nachos were so bad, served with cream and not sour cream, a tiny pot of guacamole and a strange salsa. It came with jalapeños peppers, houmous and cucumber! Not sure if this was to make up for the lack of guacamole! The young lady serving us was very nice but the older lady very scary! We certainly won’t be going back.",Date of visit: May 2019,The Antelope Inn,4,"Upavon, United Kingdom"

Great Stay,"We stayed at this hotel from Friday to Monday.
Firstly, from originally booking to leaving at the end of our stay we had excellent service.
Our room was wonderful and the food and service in the restaurant was first class.
The hotel has a very friendly bar with a good range of ales and lagers and again, friendly and efficient service.
Definitely recommend this hotel.",Date of stay: November 2018,Aysgarth Falls Hotel,4,"Aysgarth, United Kingdom"
