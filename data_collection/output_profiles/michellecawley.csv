Absolutely superb fishing trip,"Fishing Cruises Kefalonia ""Dimitrios-Efthimia a huge thank you for a fantastic day.

The family had an amazing day and the dog loved every minute.

You guys are wonderful hosts, very accommodating to our requests of bringing our dog and the baby.

The food was beautiful, wine and beers flowing all day as well as all refreshments.

Our Private trip was very affordable, I would highly recommend this to everyone wanting to do something special and a little different.

See you guys again next year.",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Boat trip,"Just had the best experience ever on this boat trip..... been coming to kefalonia for 25years, and finding Dimitri and Efi’s company was fantastic. Not only are they an amazing hosts they are beautiful people.... it’s tailored for everyone to have a go, friends , family children, what a great laugh we had, this is not only dedicated to fishing, it’s a great experience. The food was delicious Efi is a great cook.,.,, we hired the boat privately but they offer groups of up to 12... brilliant all round would highly recommend this to everyone.....
Fishing tourism kefalonia is the best
