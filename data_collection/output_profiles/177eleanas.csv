A special trip with a real fishing boat,"A very special trip you won't get elsewhere. Many places do sailing trips but a real fishing boat experience is different. The captain was wonderful and we were treated to fresh fish soup (just amazing), food from his own veggie patch that his family made for us and the crystal clear, almost private coves of Polyaigos. We were picked up from Kimolos instead of Milos as that's where we were staying. Thank you so much to the team!",Date of experience: June 2019,Boat Trips-VIP/Family daily cruises in Milos,5,"Kimolos, Greece"
Fantastic food and wonderful people!,"Lovely restaurant by the sea serving traditional seafood and greek taverna fare. The chef has put his own modern twist on several of the meals. Definitely try the salads and starters, which are all fabulous. A bit pricey but absolutely worth it!",Date of visit: June 2019,Prasonisi,5,"Kimolos, Greece"
Free walking tour and Gaudi tour - both excellent!,"Naomi, our free tour guide, was wonderful, full of energy and interesting facts. She was a delight!
Vera, our Gaudi guide, was enthusiastic and thorough. She managed to convey the Gaudi and modernism movement feel in 3.5h!",Date of experience: September 2017,"2,5-hour Barcelona City Bike Tour",5,"Barcelona, Spain"
