"Chic apartment, excellent service, historic center","Couldn’t wish for a better option of accommodation to share with a friend. Spacious apartment, elegantly decorated and very well equipped in a magnificent restored town villa; right in the historic center, close to everything to be explored by foot. The very extensive and varied organic breakfast delivered to your door makes every morning a luxurious affair. Quite unique for a rented apartment.
Highly recommended to all looking for an elegant, peaceful and relaxing stay in Porto. Alida is a wonderful host and without any intrusion is always there to respond to your needs.
Most appreciated.",Date of stay: October 2020,B28 Apartments Porto,4,"Porto, Portugal"
Forget the Oia sunset. This is the true heart and soul of Santorini,"We have never considered Santorini as a holiday destination because of its image - “masses of tourists chasing the sunset”. Until the COVID-struck 2020 brought us here and until we met the Prekas family who showed us the true Santorini.
I don’t want to make it a spoiler for any of you, moreover, one cannot describe in words what you are to experience on board the Flora fishing boat.
As a taster: expect to come face to face with the heart and soul of the island, expect to live in 1/2 day through the range of emotions only a Greek, a Santorinian can. It’s all about the splendour of nature, the feast straight from the the sea and the family kitchen, the truest Greek celebration of life and love.
We will probably be living and reliving this day for many more years to come.
Thank you Kyriakos, Veta & Antoni. You are one incredible family!",Date of experience: August 2020,Flora Fishing Tours,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Beautiful cathedral and the surrounding quarter. Definitely worth a visit,Small and absolutely gorgeous cathedral with an interesting story. Worth getting a tour guide during the visit.,Date of experience: February 2019,Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood,4,"St. Petersburg, Russia"
"Great service, excellent location and perfect service","Excellent stay at Yakinthos and only positive experiences: the upstairs room we had was spacious, including a huge terrace with panoramic views of the sea - excellent place to start your day with a breakfast delivered to your room. The hotel facilities were more than sufficient for us: breakfast, pool to chill on a hot afternoon (with light lunches available to order) with a lovely terrace, parking. The hotel is up on the hill and spoils you to magnificent bird-eye views over the bay. The beach is only 10-15 min walk (you have to go uphill of course on the way back) or a 3 min drive. The hosts are extremely helpful and certainly succeeded in creating a home-like atmosphere, yet will never bother you unnecessarily. The service staff were excellent too - all requests addressed immediately and without a problem.We had a wonderful stay at Yakinthos",Date of stay: August 2018,Yakinthos Residence,4,"Mykonos, Greece"
"Very comfortable rooms, excellent location, attentive staff","I had a very cosy room and extremely comfortable bed. Coffee machine was a welcome touch. The hotel houses one of the best Asian restaurants in the Netherlands, which is a useful addition, although on weekends you can hear the noise in some rooms.
Unfortunately, I didn't have breakfast at the hotel due to early morning arrangements at the office, as the breakfast buffet looked extensive in the selection variety and very interesting.
I don't know exactly how large the hotel is but it has a wonderful feel of a boutique establishment; you always feel very private and at home.
Highly recommended.",Date of stay: January 2017,Sir Albert Hotel,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Home for global nomads,"A wonderful concept that one struggles to call a simple hotel.
When you travel a lot, staying in hotels can become a daunting prospect. Zoku changes this completely and creates a home away from home for travellers and global nomads.
3 aspects of Zoku bring it all together.
Live - wonderfully setup, very modern and smart lofts have all you need, including extremely cosy and huge bed tucked away in the mezzanine, well-fitted kitchenette, dining room table, a small office station, and much more. Laundry and bike rentals are very useful additions.
Work - even if you are not staying at Zoku, go to the magnificent co-working space on the top floor. This place has to be seen and experienced! Every detail in the design, room configuration and an open dining room simply make you feel at home. The rooftop garden is something spectacular too.
Creating connections and building networks is key for Zoku and everyone goes an extra mile to help you make it happen.
Eat - food at Zoku needs a special mentioning. Carefully selected international chefs will treat you to a delicious and creative social table for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Produce is always fresh and sustainable, and the variety will never bore you.
Zoku team are wonderful. Already after my first stay they became friends rather than hotel staff.
Boku's concept is very well suited for long stays. If you are relocating to Amsterdam and need a place to live before you find a rental, or if you are in Amsterdam for a long stay, head to Zoku, You will not regret it",Date of stay: October 2016,Zoku Amsterdam,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
"Excellent food, service and atmosphere","We walked in on a very busy Saturday evening and the staff made a plan to accommodate us. Great food, service and atmosphere
International cuisine specializing in meat dishes, yet the salmon was also excellent. The chef puts a lot of attention to quality and adds a special touch
Definitely recommended",Date of visit: March 2016,Venus & Adonis,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
