A real fishing boat experience,"Fishing trips can take many forms. This one is a 22 year old wooden fishing boat that is operating as it always has. The difference is that a few of us can watch it in action, see the days catch - various fish, lobster, crabs etc plus some interest for the children with starfish and sea urchins. While we swim in a secluded bay the crew produce a wonderful combination of appetisers, soups and pasta dishes made from the days catch and washed down with some local and very palatable wine. Great day. Swimming gear a must, snorkelling gear if you use it, but I would also recommend something a little softer to sit on during the trip. The experience is well worth it.",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Very short stay,Like many other people we used the holiday inn as an overnight stop between air flights. It is well geared up for this with hourly shuttle services to and from the airport and also an early start to breakfast. The room was very comfortable and the staff extremely helpful. I would certainly use it again.,Date of stay: January 2017,Holiday Inn Athens Attica Avenue Airport West,4,"Paiania, Greece"
Quiet haven,"After 3 days of a busy Venice and a great deal of walking we bought a couple of day tickets on the vaporettos and took ourselves off to the relative quiet of Murano. Al Soffiador is in a pleasant square and offers good food, wine and excellent value for money. Well worth a visit.",Date of visit: September 2016,Al Soffiador Restaurant,4,"Murano, Italy"
Disappointing,"Small room in annex down side street. Bar outside main hotel is franchised out I think, but it's certainly confusing. Breakfast good, hotel staff not always helpful, roof garden disappointing. Noisy location.",Date of stay: September 2016,Hotel Paganelli,4,"Venice, Italy"
My favourite village bar,Aeolos bar in Spartia is my favourite place. It is a family run business that includes a well stocked market shop. Marina and her family provide excellent service and better value than many other outlets. If they don't have what you're looking for then ask- they'll find it. The bar is comfortable and relaxed. Like many village bars throughout the world it is also the centre of the community for finding out what is happening and when.,Date of visit: June 2016,Aeolos Coffee - Bar,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Well into my kef top 10,Beautiful location with superb menu range. Mushroom with crab and prawn highly regarded and sea bass fillet in wine sauce excellent. Pork in plum sauce also enjoyed.,Date of visit: June 2016,Cozy,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Peaceful backwater,"Seminyak in Bali is quite noisy and very hot and humid. The traffic is busy and also noisy. Tony's villas are situated only 30/40 metres off the high street but, because of their situation and the natural screening of numerous plants and palm trees, it provides a peaceful backwater. It is a collection of villas, some with their own pools but it also has a large pool area and a central complex for reception, bar and restaurant.",Date of stay: January 2016,Tonys Villas & Resort,4,"Seminyak, Indonesia"
OK for quick stopover,"V Hotel Bencoolen is temporarily tucked away by barriers while the metro construction goes on in Bencoolen Street. This is not due to finish until 2017. Very cramped bedrooms, poor or no facilities for food and drink. Helpful staff. Pool area not good and artificial garden worse. We stayed two nights before catching a cruise liner. That was enough.",Date of stay: January 2016,V Hotel Bencoolen,4,"Singapore, Singapore"
Must do,Singapore slings in Raffles is a must do experience. We followed it up with some excellent food though predominantly Italian and some good wine. Fairly expensive but that is true of Singapore in general.,Date of visit: January 2016,Raffles Courtyard,4,"Singapore, Singapore"
Superb views,"We chose a bad day - heavy wind and rain. We had to evacuate the outside bar area.
Didn't try the food but the drinks were expensive",Date of experience: January 2016,Sands Skypark Observation Deck,4,"Singapore, Singapore"
"highs, more highs and lows",134 steps up which for over 60s is hard work. Staff friendly and restaurant good though limited menu. view from front is stunning including fabulous full moon but sadly our room at the back had no view and the room itself was ok but not great.. overall - disappointing,Date of stay: August 2015,Ponti Beach Hotel,4,"Lefkada, Greece"
Sivita rediscovered,"pleasant family run bar/restaurant on the sea front. good food, good prices and good company. No pressure to come in unlike some of the neighbouring restaurants",Date of visit: August 2015,12 gods,4,"Lefkada, Greece"
close to the square,"Papparazi is an authentic Italian Restaurant just behind the main square in Argostoli. The menu is Italian, the wine is Italian and the ambience is Italian. Six of us went just after the Xmas light up in the square and enjoyed the bruschetta, various pizzas and some delicious steaks (in my case a fillet cooked with gorganzola cheese on top - delicious). Give it a try",Date of visit: December 2014,Paparazzi il Ristorante,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Friendly service and good food,"We went to this pleasant smallish restaurant on two occasions on our recent trip to Amsterdam.On the first occasion we tried the Indonesian Tafel and enjoyed most of it, though my wife is not too keen on the Satay dishes. On the next occasion we went Tibetan and enjoyed that also. It is true that there are other Indonesian alternatives on the Utrechtsestraat but this one suited us particularly for its accommadating opening times.",Date of visit: November 2014,Tashi Deleg,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
comfortable and well placed,"Room overlooking the canal was pleasant, clean and comfortable. Breakfast was good. Location is ideal for visitors to Amsterdam. The staff were extremely helpful but I would have liked to have seen a better bar area and selection of drinks, and some tea/coffee making facilities in the room.",Date of stay: November 2014,The Bridge Hotel,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Out of Season for Kefalonia but still good,"Kefalonia begins to close down for the winter towards the end of October but our visit to Ampelaki was refeshingly good at the weekend. The feta cheese with honey and sesame seeds. the Bourokakia (if I've spelt it correctly), and the fried Zucchini made excellent starters followed by chicken in brandy for my wife, rabbit for me, and a pasta dish for my sister. All excellent and we will be back again later this winter.",Date of visit: October 2014,Ampelaki Greek Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Always good,"Maybe a chinese meal is not everybody's choice when on holiday in Greece but for those of us who live here it is always a good meal. Friends and relatives who stay with us believe it is better than many chinese restaurants in UK. I would recommend the Hot and Sour soup, the shredded beef with hot spice and the chicken with lemon sauce but there are so many alternatives. Give it a try.",Date of visit: October 2014,Chinese Dragon,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
New this year,"This restaurant has one of the best views on the island. A family run business that just started this year. Very friendly, good food though, at this stage, a slightly restricted menu, particularly in the fish dish area. A rating of 4 for a restaurant so new is very good and I would hope higher ratings will follow.",Date of visit: October 2014,il Borgo,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Open Sundays,In the backstreets but still quite busy. The original restaurant we were aiming for did not serve food on Sundays but we found this just around the corner. Try the cheese board and enjoy the duck. Service excellent,Date of visit: September 2014,Mani'omio,4,"Pisa, Italy"
Pig shin,Saturday night find by accident. Pig shin on the menu was great but others drooled over steak tenderloin and cod fish. Tried again on Sunday night but restaurant not open. Backstreet location but busy area. Service very good.,Date of visit: September 2014,Modus Bibendi,4,"Pisa, Italy"
A Break from shopping,"A street cafe with nice wines, some tasty snacks (free) and reasonable prices. Daisy is attentive and good fun. A great people watching location and welcome seat while the Missus is still shopping.",Date of visit: September 2014,Little Star Cafe,4,"Pisa, Italy"
Second Time,"Second time at this hotel, this time with my wife and sister. Clean, convenient for the city centre, helpful, good breakfast, pleasant terrace and easy access from airport with hotel pick-up. We'll be back!!",Date of stay: September 2014,Bologna Hotel Pisa,4,"Pisa, Italy"
It's a takeaway,One of the best takeaway meals for a long while. We enjoyed it with friends visiting from Greece and it was superb. Try a drink in the Joiners while you're waiting. A good local pub that never changes.,Date of visit: February 2014,Morpeth Tandoori,4,"Morpeth, United Kingdom"
Comfortable,"Bar and Restaurant were being refurbished so can't comment about those. However, room was clean and comfortable, breakfast was good and plenty of it, and the staff could not have been more helpful and courteous. There were three of us in our 60's and we found no difficulty walking into the centre though we opted for a cab on the way back (around 10 euros).
Go left out of the hotel and first left again. About 100 metres on the right is a family run restaurant called Brancaleone. Give it a try!!",Date of stay: February 2014,Hotel Oxford,4,"Rome, Italy"
7 years later,"Yes, the waiters try to entice you in but so they do in all the neighbouring restaurants. I visited Rome 7 years ago and found L'Arcano to be a convenient and welcoming end of walk stop-off. 7 years later and it is still one of my favourites despite some extremely indifferent reviews from other customers. Mid way between the Pantheon and the Trevi Fountain, it is an extremely convenient place to rest your feet and have a glass or two of the house white (Tuscan, I think).",Date of visit: February 2014,L'Arcano,4,"Rome, Italy"
"Many, many visits here.","'To Kastro' is consistently good. Friendly owners and staff, good home-produced food, fabulous views and a selection of Greek music in the background that creates a beautiful ambience. I can sit there for hours. Don't be put off by the steep hill up to the castle. It is worth it - and there is a slightly less steep route on the north side of the hill. Yamas",Date of visit: September 2013,Kastro Cafe,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lucky Find,"Only in Pisa for 3 nights, we found this gem on night 2 and went back again on night 3. Staff courteous and very professional, food excellent and beautifully presented and range of wines superb. Tip - try the cheese selection.",Date of visit: October 2012,Hostaria Le Repubbliche Marinare,4,"Pisa, Italy"
