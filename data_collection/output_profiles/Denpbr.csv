An unforgettable day at sea,"This trip is a perfect opportunity to enjoy Samos at its best. The hosts, Giannis and Nancy are very helpful, knowledgeable, and have a passion for what they do. They know the waters and will provide bait and equipment suited for a great fishing experience. They are also helpful in teaching different fishing techniques and can tell a lot about the waters. Nancy is also a great cook, and will make a really nice meal from minute-fresh ingredients. Deep blue water, a bent fishing rod and the lovely people will definitely make it a day to remember.",Date of experience: July 2019,Samos Fishing Trips,5,"Samos, Greece"
Skjult perle,"Et kjempekoselig, lite sted gjemt i en sidegate, med høy klasse på drinkene. Drink-menyen er satt sammen av en mixologist og blir byttet ut hvert år. Lokale råvarer og utrolig hyggelig betjening som yter svært bra service. Definitivt å anbefale!",Date of visit: July 2019,P2,5,"Samos, Greece"
