Disappointing,"We went for afternoon tea with friends today - first of all they couldn't find our booking, then the crockery was dirty, some of the food was inedible and the service was extremely slow. We've been here before and had an amazing meal, so when an offer came up on Groupon we were delighted. Really glad we only paid the Groupon price for what was a really disappointing experience.",Date of visit: September 2019,The Chapel 1877 Restaurant And Bar,1,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"

Birthday meal,"We ordered a meal for 10 people from here last Friday to celebrate our son's 17th birthday. The order was ready and waiting for us when we arrived. The food was piping hot and so fresh. We had such a variety of dishes from sweet & sour chicken, crispy beef, schezuan chicken and pork chow mein - and they were all delicious!! The portions were huge! This takeaway has new owners and they have certainly made a difference - we will definitely be back again soon! Thank for for such a memorable meal.",Date of visit: September 2018,Hung House,1,"Dinas Powys, United Kingdom"
Anniversary meal,"We ate here last night - wow! What an amazing experience - the decor was stunning, the service outstanding and the food 'out of this world'. We were seated quicky at a fantastic window ledge seat overlooking the sea and Sully Island. Our drinks arrived straight away and the food soon after. We ordered four tapas dishes for starters - huge portions of extremely tasty chorizo, whitebait, king prawns and papas bravas! Then we had a t-bone steak and the lemon chicken - both absolutely delicious!!! We can't wait to come back again for more!",Date of visit: September 2018,On the Rocks,1,"Penarth, United Kingdom"

We had starters and main courses - good sized portions of delicious authentic food!,Date of visit: August 2018,Irie Shack Cardiff Bay,1,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"
Wonderful food!,This is a hidden gem in a quiet back street away from the main strip of shops and bars. We had lunch here on our last day and wished we'd found it earlier on in holiday. The portions are huge and the food delicious.,Date of visit: August 2018,Chacho Fresh Burger,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Really disappointing!,"We ended up in The Grove in a recent camping trip in an attempt to escape the rain. Initially only intending on having a drink, the menu looked so inviting that we decided to stay for food - what a mistake that was! The service was appalling - one of the members of staff was extremely rude to us, whilst the rest of them had a 'couldn't care less' attitude! Having spent nearly £200 on a pub meal we expected politeness at least! A number of the meals we ordered were disappointing - the pasta dish was so small that we had to order chips and garlic bread to fill my son up; the sausages from the kids menu tasted so much of beer that the child couldn't eat them; and the crispy duck salad was anything but crispy! A really expensive disappointment! Never again!",Date of visit: August 2018,The Grove,1,"St. Davids, United Kingdom"
Great for Bond enthusiasts!,"Visited last week using a Groupon voucher - whilst it was interesting, glad we didn't pay full price.",Date of experience: August 2018,The London Film Museum - Covent Garden,1,"London, United Kingdom"

"Great service, food and views","We were just looking for a drink in Puerto colero but actually stumbled across a hidden gem. We ordered some snacks, cakes and drinks. Everything was fresh, delicious and well presented. Also, the staff were very friendly and pleasant. Couldn't fault anything, all pleased with what we got. Good value, great view from the balcony and would thoroughly reccommed.",Date of visit: July 2018,The Upper Deck Pub,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Good place for a 'specual' meal,"Staff were very attentive and extremely polite. Good was very good, although not 'wow'. Lovely surroundings, lovely decor. Roof terrace could have been a bit bigger!",Date of visit: June 2018,Marco Pierre White Steakhouse Bar & Grill Cardiff,1,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"
Sooooo disappointing!!!,"Visited yesterday for Sunday lunch with friends. After ordering, it took twenty minutes for the waiter to come back to say none of the starters were available. We then waited over an hour forr a sparce plate of lukewarm, underwhelming food . We were offered a free dessert as a consolation, only to be told that none of the desserts we'd chosen were actually available!

We asked to speak to the manager but he refused to come out of his office.

So disappointing as we have had great experiences at The Conway and The Pilot.",Date of visit: February 2018,The Old Swan Inn,1,"Llantwit Major, United Kingdom"
Stunning property,"Ideally situated for exploring the northern half of the island, in a small village consisting of a taverna, bakery and mini market. Beautiful pool and gardens, numerous terraces and balconies to admire the wonderful views. The villa was spotlessly clean and well equipped. The pool was cleaned every day and the villa once a week.
Anna was so helpful and knowledgeable about places to visit and things to do.
Wouldn't hesitate to recommend.",Date of stay: July 2017,Stamoulis Villas,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"

There weren't any restaurant PS or cafes there not were there any water sports.",Date of experience: July 2017,Myrtos Beach,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"

So picturesque,Gorgeous scenery. Lovely beach. Beautiful harbour. Well worth walking up to the fort. Plenty of places to eat or have a drink. Scary road to get there though.,Date of experience: July 2017,Assos,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
What an amazing day!,"We spent the day with Antonia and her family on their traditional fishing boat. After being served delicious home made cake and coffee, we left the harbour just after 8am. We went out to sea for about half an hour then watched as the 2km long nets were pulled up to expose what had been caught - from star fish to red snappers to lobster to octopus. We stopped just off the coast for a pre-lunch swim and then we all feasted on the day's catch once it had been prepared and cooked by Mustaffa alongside the wonderful dips, salads and bread provided by Antonia. It was all delicious. We returned back to the harbour just after four thirty after having the best day of our holiday by far. Thank you to Antonia, Michaelis, Mustaffa and Nikki for such a memorable day.",Date of experience: July 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Terrible!,We went to Bill's last night - it was a disaster from start to finish. Most of the meals on the menu weren't available so we all had to make a second choice; one of our party found a shard of glass in his drink; all the meals bar one arrived. The missing meal apparently had been 'cremated' so could we choose something else? Thiis was whilst the rest of the party were tucking in to their food! They did knock something off the bill but it was still very expensive for what we had.,Date of visit: March 2017,Bill’s Cardiff Bay,1,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"
Wonderful,"Stayed at the Llangennith site of Scamper Holidays from Thurs to Sat this week. From the initial enquiry, booking, pre-arrival info, welcome pack and check in - all first class. Accommodation was well thought out with huge attention to detail - every comfort and convenience considered. Everyone we met from the Scamper team was extremely friendly and eager to please. We loved Beryl, our camoer van, and air tent accommodation. Mark even went to the trouble of researching activities for our teenage sons to try out. We'll definitely be back again. Loved the whole experience - apart from the weather. Thank you Mark and team.",Date of stay: September 2016,Scamperholidays,1,"Rhossili, United Kingdom"
So friendly!,"Three teenage boys spent a fantastic morning here yesterday doing archery, air rifle and air soft shooting. The staff were all really friendly, knowledgeable and encouraging.

OK for a mini break!,Room was on the small size and we were expecting a balcony with a canal view. Instead we got a view of a run down courtyard with no balcony. Didn't realise hotel was immediately next door to a mini red light district - no mention if that in hotel's website or Travel Republics.,Date of stay: August 2016,Sir Albert Hotel,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"

Ghost tour with Howard,We had a wonderful tour of the castle with Howard - full of fascinating tales of ghost sightings and poltergeist activity. Howard was an excellent story teller and kept the whole group enthralled for the whole of the tour which lasted approx two hours.
