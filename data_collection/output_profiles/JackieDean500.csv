WOW....BEST TRIP EVER !,"An amazing trip...Efi and the guys were so friendly you instantly felt like old friends. The boat is well equipped and impeccably clean. Coffee and cakes on arrival. Plenty of drinks for the day, and Efi's homemade lemonade is a must. Sorting the fish from the nets is as hands on as you want, the choice is yours. The food Efi produces, both the cooked fish and homemade salads is both delicious and plentiful. Scenery second to none and we stopped for leisurely breaks at 3 secluded beaches. An absolutely stunning day out, loved every minute.",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Amazing Meal,"Myself and daughter booked a table for a night out during our girly stay in Mevagissey. Food was amazing and the team were all friendly , professional and a pleasure to speak with. Food was delivered fast, tables cleared quickly and all with a smile. Loved the place and highly recommend. Advise booking to be sure of a table as they are very popular, and it's easy to see why.",Date of visit: August 2018,Sharksfin Bar & Restaurant,5,"Mevagissey, United Kingdom"

GEM OF A PLACE !,"Stayed here for a week for a cycling holiday booked through Mac's Adventures, so we hadn't actually selected our room ourselves. On arrival Philippa welcomed us with coffees and shortbread before taking us to our room. We were given room 11 - and what a fantastic room. Ground floor big room, with the most comfortable bed, sofa, table & chair, full size tv, fridge, hairdryer, bath robes and generous quantities of tea/coffee/milk/sugar and biscuits. A large bottle of water was in the fridge, and this was renewed every day. Plenty of storage space, and everything impeccably clean. The bathroom had a heated towel rail and under floor heating, which was a godsend for drying off our wet cycling gear. We had a big bath with separate shower cubicle. Big/soft and fresh smelling towels and top quality, full size toiletries were also provided. Breakfast was absolutely delicious, such variety, juices/tea/coffee/, help yourself cereals/yoghurt/fruit/croissants/preserves as well as a wide choice of cooked options. The cooked breakfasts were amazing - cooked to perfection and always lovely and hot. All foods and toiletries are sourced locally which is always great to see. Philippa, Trevor and their team are friendly and professional, and attention to detail along with great quality is evident everywhere here. There was even a lockable shed for our bikes as well as hose to clean them off. This place and it's people are all top notch, and we would both stay here again as well as recommend to family and friends. Many thanks Hawksmoor !",Date of stay: September 2017,Hawksmoor Lakeland Guesthouse,5,"Windermere, United Kingdom"
Fabulous place !,"Pinkmans really is a gem of a find. The coffee is perfect and the savouries and sweets selection is second to none - looking and tasting absolutely delicious. The range of sourdough loaves to buy is vast, and i'd def recommend trying the seeded one....lush. Have been reliably informed the pizzas are amazing too, so am looking forward to trying these real soon. Add all this to lovely friendly team members, great service and beautiful decor and you've found yourself the perfect place.",Date of visit: December 2016,Pinkmans,5,"Bristol, United Kingdom"
