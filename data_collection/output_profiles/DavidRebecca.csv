"Great food, even better service","We stopped off at this restaurant on our way to a skiing holiday in Austria. They were very accomodating, as we hadn't booked, and we were made to feel very welcome.

The food was great, we ate the pizza's and pasta. All were very tasty and of good quality.

Excellent hotel in Kaprun,"We have just spent a week at the Sonja Alpine resort. We thought that the hotel was excellent, the rooms cosy, the staff polite and friendly. The spa area and pool are special and the views on the mountains add to the experience. We found the hotel quiet and were not disturbed at all by the quiet mountain railway that runs nearby. Highly recommended!",Date of stay: January 2019,Sonja Alpine Resort,4,"Piesendorf, Austria"
Wonderful week in Mae Nam,"We have just returned from a great week at Lotus Samui. We cannot find fault with our stay. A great villa, with a fantastic pool on the beach, supported by a very attentive team.

Looking forward to the next visit!",Date of stay: March 2018,Hotel La Chaumiere,4,"Morzine, France"
Wonderful stay at Hotel Walserhof,We spent a great week in a wonderful apartment. Silvia was a fantastic hostess and was extremely attentive. Nothing was too much trouble.

Nice stay in Chinon,"We stayed here twice in August as part of a cycling holiday. The hotel is a very sweet, typically French hotel. It was very hot when we stayed, but each room had a fan and we slept well.
The breakfast is good. Fantastic home made jams. The location is also ideal for visiting Chinon, being 5 minutes walk to the centre and within easy reach of the castle and river.",Date of stay: August 2016,Hotel Diderot,4,"Chinon, France"
Fantastic stay,"We spent two nights here as part of a family holiday touring the loire region on bikes.

We loved this beautiful hotel on the banks of the Loire.",Date of stay: August 2016,HOTEL&SPA La Marine de Loire Montsoreau,4,"Montsoreau, France"
Wonderful stay with wonderful hosts,"We have just spent two nights as part of a tour of the Loire region on our bikes.
The hotel is modern, the rooms spacious, and the hotel was spotlessly clean. Breakfast was excellent, the home made jams were wonderful. We were made very welcome and felt very well looked after. We highly recommend this hotel for short stays when visiting the Loire region.",Date of stay: August 2016,Hotel Le Haut des Lys,4,"Villandry, France"
Wonderful food made and served by wonderful people,"We were lucky enough to eat here two nights in a row as part of our bike tour of the Loire region.

Highly recommended.",Date of visit: August 2016,L'Etape Gourmande,4,"Villandry, France"
Ideal for a family holiday in the Gstaad area,"We spent 6 nights in this hotel, which is a short drive from Gstaad and the slopes.
We stayed in the newly renovated rooms on the right side of the hotel, which were warm, spacious and had wonderful views over the valley. The kids really liked the large pool and spent hours there. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We really liked this hotel and would recommend it to others.",Date of stay: February 2016,The Sun & Soul Panorama Pop-Up Hotel Solsana,4,"Gstaad, Switzerland"
Fantastic ski-ing,"Take the lift to the top of Wispile, then either the red or black slopes. Have fun on the 'rollercoaster' piste (as we like to call it). Brilliant fun after a fresh dump of snow. Probably only for advanced skiers (from the top), but intermediates should be fine if they get off half way up (which they can do).",Date of experience: February 2016,Wispile,4,"Gstaad, Switzerland"
Overnight stay,"We spent a night in this lovely hotel on our way to Switzerland.

The hotel is very clean and modern inside. The rooms were spacious and warm. The shower was great.

We also had a fantastic meal in the restaurant. Real quality food with friendly service for a reasonable price.

We were very impressed with this hotel.",Date of stay: February 2016,Waldhotel Sophienhof,4,"Koenigswinter, Germany"
Family holiday in Kuredu,"Just back from a week in kuredu.

This was our second visit to the Maldives, but the first as a family.

The resort is great for families and there was loads for the kids to do.

The highlights were:

- A half day boat trip to see dolphins, manta rays and turtles. We saw all three.

- A trip to Nafaru, a local island which was nice to see

- The beach...We were on the arrivals side of the island..in a Jacuzzi villa..definitely the best option for families in our view

We also took full advantage of the free watersports..note snorkeling is extra.

We also had a photo shoot and some very nice photos to take home.

Our top tips would be:

- ask for a room on the arrivals side of the island..You will need to book a Jacuzzi villa

- go to the pool after 4pm..before that it was a bit hard to find and then hang on to a sunbed..But with the private beach had it diddn't matter

- if you are a couple looking for a quieter time perhaps this is not the best option..But there were lots of couples...not hooneymooners, who seemed very happy to join in with the rest of us..",Date of stay: April 2015,Kuredu Island Resort & Spa,4,Kuredu
Great day out fishing with the kids,"We had a great day out with Jameel and Clair fishing off the Dubai coast. It was a hot day for April (39-40 degrees!), but we were kept cool with lots of drinks. We caught two (very large) King Baracudas and a smaller Baracuda when trawling and loads of smaller fish when bottom fishing.
We would strongly recommend Go Fishing in Dubai for a great day out. Make sure you book well in advance though...Jameel and Clair are very much in demand.",Date of experience: April 2014,Go Fishing Tours,4,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
Excellent Family Sized Appartments In The Heart Of JBR,"We have just returned from 8 nights at the JA Oasis Beach Tower. We were on the 43rd floor, in a large 3 bedroom appartment, ideal for 5 of us. The appartment was very comfortable and the general facilities on offer made our stay easy and hassle free. Things to note when staying:

- There is a large, fully equipped gym in the other tower opposite. Very easy access and you
can exercise whilst looking over the beach.

- You can take the hotel towels to the beach + a parasol.

- The pool gets a mixture of sun and shade throughout the day as the surrounding towers
provide shade. Very welcome and a nice breeze at mid-day

- The beach front has recently been revamped and many new restaurants are opening up.
Loads of choice and top quality food and drink available right on the beach

If you are looking for an option to stay as a family and need a change from the larger chain hotels, this is a very good option.",Date of stay: April 2014,JA Oasis Beach Tower,4,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
Fun day out; city tour and dune driving,"We spent 1/2 day with FunTours and Adil on a city tour and desert safari. We had a great time. Adil did his best to impart as much knowledge about Dubai as possible (not an easy task as we lived there in the 90's..although a lot has changed) and the desert safari was fantastic. The kids loved the dune experience. The evening entertainment was OK. A bit touristy for our liking, but if you want to get the Arabian experience, camels, good food and traditional dance and music, then it's worth doing. We'd recommend fun tours for a good day out in Dubai.",Date of experience: April 2014,Funtours Desert Safari Dubai,4,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
Fun with the dolphins,We spent 30 minutes with the dolphins in Dolphin Bay and really got close to them. The children loved it and the event was extremely well organised.,Date of experience: April 2014,Dolphin Bay,4,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
A tour up the Burj Al Arab,"The experience is definitely worth doing, but it was very busy (19:30pm) and once we were on the 124th viewing floor (there are more than 200 floors) it wasn't that clear where to queue for photos or where to queue to come back down again. As a result we spent about 10 mins on the viewing deck and another 30 mins in a queue trying to come back down again. So in short, a very impressive building and structure, but a bit more co-ordination and organisation when you are up there would be useful.",Date of experience: April 2014,Burj Al Arab,4,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
Very Impressive Displays,"Very impressive fountains, just a shame that you only get one short 3 minute show every half hour. We would have preferred to have seen a 15 minute show, perhaps once an hour.",Date of experience: April 2014,The Dubai Fountain,4,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
A great week in Sainte Foy,"We had a great week in Sainte Foy staying with Auberge & Chalets Sur La Montagne. Despite a 6 hour delay to our flight, we were picked up and taken to the chalet with the minimum of fuss. The chalet is ideally located and 2 minutes walk from the slopes. It was very clean and tidy and well presented. The ski fitting service was excellent, friendly and very convenient. Much better than the usual hassle of having to get fitted in a ski shop. The support (Ruth) was immediate and efficient.

All in all, a great week, in a great location.",Date of stay: February 2014,Chataigne,4,"Sainte-Foy-Tarentaise, France"
Good food and wine in a friendly and relaxed environment,"We ate at this restaurant with 11 of us. The service was friendly and the waiter was keen to recommend a number of very good local wines. The children (6 of them) were well looked after with steak, chips and pasta. We were spoilt for choice with a number of nice options including veal, steak and other traditional local dishes. We come to Vallandry often and if you are looking for a nice evening out, close to the centre, and child friendly then you should try here.",Date of visit: January 2014,La Bergerie de Raphael,4,"Vallandry, France"
A week in paradise,"We have been lucky enough to spend 7 days in Baros during December. Everything that has been written is true...it really is a very special place.

Here's our 5 top tips to get the best from your stay:

1. Accomodation. All of the accomodation is excellent. If you are in Baros for your honeymoon, then the water villas would seem best. We had a beach villa near the dive school and it was perfect. Very quiet, own beach, sunset in the evening. If you want direct access to the small lagoon and the house reef then try the other side of the island, noting it was windier in December than the dive school side, and you don't get the sunset. Some people split their time between the water villas and a beach villa, which is also an option.

2. Food. Again, excellent. We ate at all 3 restaurants. Service was very friendly, food of a high quality. The BBQ and buffet nights are worth going to. The after dinner entertainment was of a high standard.

3. Nightlife. Very relaxed. Most of the action takes place after dinner in the Sail bar where you can sit and sip cocktails under the palm trees

4. Day time activities. We did a lot of the trips. We caught 3 large fish, went shopping to Male and had a lovely sunset cruise. All well organised and worth doing.

5. Other activities. The house reef is amazing and just off the beach. We hired a transparent canoe which was fun. Make sure you check the tides and the wind before snorkeling, as it can be very sheltered on the other side of the island. There were lots of other diving and night snorkeling trips which we didn't have the time to do, but that looked fun.

We love Baros, a perfect getaway",Date of stay: December 2013,Baros Maldives,4,Baros Island
"Modern, clean and very central","We spent a few nights in the Habitat Suites during March. We received a warm welcome and check-in was quick and efficient. The appartment itself has been recently renovated and has been well done. We were with 3 children and the appartment was ideal.
Location wise, it couldn't really be better, being 2 mins walk to the Cathedral and the streets surrounding it and 3 mins walk to the main square. You can also catch all of the Granada buses from outside the door that take you to the various attractions.",Date of stay: March 2013,Habitat Suites Gran Via,4,"Granada, Spain"
Fantastic tapas and great wine,"This was our favourite tapas bar in Sevilla. We ate there 3 times in a week!
The menu is varied, the quality outstanding and the wine fantastic. You know it's good when almost every taxi driver stops as he drives past and points it out to you.

Few tips: Get there round 8:30pm. They open then. By 9pm the place will be packed, regardless of the day of the week.
You can also pop in and make a reservation if you want to get there a little later (but they may insist on an 8:30pm start, as they are so busy!)",Date of visit: April 2013,Vinos contra Tapas,4,"Seville, Spain"
"Great day out - dunes, wildlife & horse riding","Just spent an excellent day out with David exploring the beauty of the Donana nature reserve, eating a great seafood lunch at the beach and horse riding with the family (on the beach and in the dunes).

From the minute David picked us up and drove us South, he was an excellent host, and made a real effort to make sure we all had a great day. The kids loved the horse riding and the bird spotting.
If you are looking for an alternative day out, with a local Spanish host - choose NJAT. You won't be disappointed.",Date of experience: April 2013,Not Just a Tourist,4,"Seville, Spain"
A Fun Tapas Tour In The Granada Rain,"We (family of 5) spent a really fun evening with Gayle in Granada. Despite one of the wettest evenings of the year, we enjoyed great food and good company, as Gayle did her utmost to entertain our three children, whilst we drank good quality wine and ate some great food.

Gayles attention to detail and her knowledge of Granada made this a fun night out..she even set up a game for the children and bought a small prize for the winner...which was a nice touch.

Gayle fully deserves her rating on trip advisor..and if you are in Granada it's a great way to see the city at night.",Date of experience: March 2013,Granada Tapas Private Tours,4,"Granada, Spain"
"Great fish restaurant, 50 metres from the port","If you want fresh fish and great wine, with a sea view, then you should go the Le Poisson d'Avril for dinner. We had a lovely meal and excellent, friendly service. Highly recommended.",Date of visit: August 2012,Le Poisson d'Avril,4,"Guilvinec, France"
