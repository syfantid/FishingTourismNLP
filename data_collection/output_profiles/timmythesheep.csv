Fantastic evening trip,"We spent a wonderful late afternoon and evening with Antonia and the crew of Michalis. Heading out of the harbour, east along the coastline we enjoyed the fresh breeze and the beautiful views of the mountains. Having placed their lobster nets, we then sailed to Spartia beach and had some time to swim in the clear turquoise sea while Antonia prepared dinner. What a treat- succulent fresh lobster, spaghetti and salads served with delicious local wine. Having stuffed ourselves silly, we enjoyed a beautiful sunset as we sailed back home. A fabulous experience that I would recommend. Antonia is a kind and helpful hostess, who made us very very welcome and cared for.

Yum yum,"Delicious, authentic pizzas- a family favourite!!

Delicious food,"Dropped in last night for an impromptu supper, and what a pleasant surprise.

Stylish surroundings, friendly and efficient service and simply delicious food. My burger was outstanding and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his chicken dish. We shared a cheese board for dessert, which was beautifully presented, generous and very tasty. The meal was reasonably priced as were the excellent draft ales and wines. The dining room is airy, and bright but still nicely intimate.

We will certainly be back, and bringing the wider family!",Date of visit: April 2014,The Trooper,4,"Wall, United Kingdom"
"Nice, but doubt we'll return","I would echo a lot of what others have already said.

We stayed for a week, with a 2 and 4 year old. We stayed in a Caldey connect as had grandparents joining is for the weekend in the adjoining lodge.

Firstly, the scenery is beautiful with fabulous views. It was our first visit to Pembrokeshire, and we were blown away with its beauty. The site is on quite a steep hill, with the village and lake at the bottom. Getting 2 children up and down to the car park, pool and adventure centre was pretty hard going and a golf cart was a necessity (Â£140 for the week!!!).

The lodge was reasonable- not 5* luxury. It had a very well-equiped kitchen and good-sized living area. The bedrooms were nicely furnished but with awful, lumpy matresses. The bathroom was a wetroom, which was frankly annoying, slippy and dangerous. Both of my children and mother in law slipped and fell on the wet tiled floors. I would have preferred a proper bath/shower.

The pool and adventure centre sounded great but were a little disappointing. Our eldest son (4) was really looking forward to going on the slides, so was crushed to learn that he was too short to be allowed on any of them (1.10m height restriction). There is only so much fun to be had on the lazy river a wave machine! The youngest (2) was bored with the baby area after minutes too. There were also loads of school children bossing the pool and being rowdy on the 2 days we used the pool. The adventure centre had a nice impressive climbing frame and mini golf which the boys enjoyed, however it was oddly soulless and lacking in atmosphere (and dark!). The kids enjoyed the Treetop Cafe buffet and TV area.

We found the range of actvities on offer was limited, but if you had older children would probably be much better. It seemed that children aged 6+ or under 2 seemed to be much better catered for than pre-schoolers. I am amazed at the poor outdoor play facilities available- 1 small climbing frame for the whole site. I'm glad we weren't in the cottages nearby as the noise in the evenings was horrendous!

The village was a nice idea, but again a bit lacking in vibrancy. The bakery was fabulous for morning pastries and bread. We ate at the pub once which was decent food, but a little overpriced. The shop was very handy. We had a takeout one night which was prompt, but again nothing special.

Off site, we had a great time. Lots of fabulous beach time at Tenby, Freshwater and surfing at Newgale. Day trips to Folly Farm and Pembroke Castle were enjoyed by all. I can't recommend Folly Farm highly enough, it was amazing!!

We will certainly go back to Pembrokeshire, but doubt we'll return to Bluestone unless it improves and delivers a better on-site experience.",Date of stay: July 2012,Bluestone National Park Resort,4,"Canaston Wood, United Kingdom"
