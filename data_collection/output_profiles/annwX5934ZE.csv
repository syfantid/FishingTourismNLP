August 2018,"What a truly wonderful day we all had. Four couples and we all had positive things to say. Dimitri and Effy are an excellent couple, nothing is too much trouble.

Girly weekender,"Fabulous accommodation in a gorgeous setting. We stayed in a three bedroomed mews, which was spacious,well equipped and comfy.Many facilities on offer but we were only there overnight and could not participate in them. Well worth a visit and ideally located for a trip to the National Arboretum. Would definitely go back on another occasion but for a longer stay.

Remembrance,Thought provoking trip to The National Arboretum. Lots to cover as it is spread out over a big area. A very respectful memorial to the victims of war. Well worth a visit but wrap up warm as it is very open.,Date of experience: November 2014,National Memorial Arboretum,4,"Alrewas, United Kingdom"
Girlie overnight stay,"We found this hotel to be very clean with a welcoming atmosphere. The room was shared by four of us and was snug but comfortable. It was certainly good value for money for an overnight stay. Would definitely stay there again.
