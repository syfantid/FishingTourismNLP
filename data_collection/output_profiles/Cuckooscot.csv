great start to our mini break,"Friendly staff, comfortable room, great selection of gin in the bar and a superb meal that exceeded our expectations for dinner. I wish I had asked a bit more about the breakfast option - I didnt appreciate that a venison slider was actually a burger - that being said, the staff were accommodating and attentive.",Date of stay: September 2020,Golf View Hotel & Spa,1,"Nairn, United Kingdom"
fun despite the weather,"dont make the mistake of driving through the unsigned car park and then finding yourself with an almost impossible task of reversing whilst avoiding the bushes!! However, the course was fun - and we dodged most of the rain - friendly staff running the club and an interesting couple of fences to add challenge to the course!",Date of experience: September 2020,Fort Augustus Golf Club,1,"Fort Augustus, United Kingdom"
disappointing menu,With such a fabulous venue I would have thought the restaurant would be more upmarket. A limited menu - and very average soup.,Date of visit: September 2020,The Boathouse Lochside Restaurant,1,"Fort Augustus, United Kingdom"
My favourite place to stay in Fort Augustus,"having stayed here with my sons several years ago, it was an easy choice to return. Despite the Covid restrictions, we felt well taken care of - the apartments was beautiful and well equipped. We enjoyed the tennis and would have investigated the other entertainment options were they available. The Boathouse was disappointing - such a luxury venue could surely have a fabulous Scottish restaurant?
I certainly plan to return - hopefully when Covid is not hovering over us!",Date of stay: September 2020,Highland Club Scotland,1,"Fort Augustus, United Kingdom"
OMG fish and chips to die for!1,having had a drink from their amazing gin selection and felt relaxed ( despite the Covid restrictions) we came back for dinner - certainly one of the best fish and chips experiences :) I even recommended to my sister that she HAD to come here when passing through 2 weeks later whilst canoeing up the caledonian canal - she concurred with my opinion!!,Date of visit: September 2020,The Lock Inn,1,"Fort Augustus, United Kingdom"
Daylight robbery!!,"what a disappointment! Having tried fruitlessly to contact the hotel about availability for both accommodation and food ( at least 2 unreturned phone calls), I was relieved to find I could book through trip advisor. With the restaurant being rated as the best in the area I was already excited. Having paid in full in advance, and still not having my call returned I was disappointed to be advised by email that there was no availability for dinner - I called again to discuss but again no response. I managed to secure a reservation to stay elsewhere in Fort Augustus and emailed my desire to cancel. Caroline returned my calls the following day and initially did not wish to refund my booking, offering to ""squeeze us in"" for dinner if I could be persuaded to stay. I explained that I had booked accommodation elsewhere but would welcome being able to come for dinner and still wished a refund. Caroline advised that we should have paid attention to the recommendation on their website that we check restaurant availability prior to booking and a refund was not possible due to the no cancellation policy. There is STILL no warning on the tripadvisor site about this and I note that the current listing ( which is cheaper than when we booked) does offer free cancellation. After some protracted discussion, Caroline advised that she would refund part of our payment but needed to ""hold on"" to £25 to cover her costs - costs for having a listing on trip advisor and her own ""admin costs"" for having to issue a refund. I felt powerless to object on the phone in case she refused any refund. I convinced myself that having effectively paid a £25 booking fee for the privilege of having dinner that she would indeed "" squeeze us in"" - but when we popped in on 12th September, she initially claimed to have no recollection of any of the previous communications..... slightly alarming to think that our predicament was not unique for her...
My partner and I remain somewhat disquieted that it still feels acceptable to Caroline that we pay £25 for making a booking that could not be honoured since the trip advisor site carries no forewarning of potential lack of restaurant availability( I did suggest that she may wish to amend her listing so that other potential customers would not be caught out in a similar way - clearly she knows better since the trip advisor site carries no details about the problems in accommodating guests in the restaurant !) - this does not reflect good customer service and certainly does not predispose me to make any sort of positive recommendation about the venue.",Date of stay: September 2020,"The Lovat, Loch Ness",1,"Fort Augustus, United Kingdom"
everyone needs to experience this amazing retreat - a real escape destination :),"what a great place to relax and unwind - I was not sure what to expect from an all-inclusive health retreat but this place exceeded my expectations on every level. The food was delicious and so very healthy - the activities were varied and fun - from the paddle-boarding to cycling and aerobics to the calming yoga ( something I intend to take up again), I felt entertained at every stage and yet there was time for me to kick back and do nothing when I wanted. I particularly enjoyed the guest speaker nutritionist who was not only knowledgable but could also share her pearls of wisdom in an easily understandable way. This weekend has made me realise how much more focus I need to spend on looking after myself and not letting my life be all about work!!",Date of stay: April 2019,The Beach Retreat,1,"Longeville-sur-mer, France"
fun way to spend my birthday :),"I was thrilled to get a last minute reservation here - the staff were knowledgeable and friendly - the boat was well equipped and I felt every attention was paid to us being comfortable. We were lucky enough to track down an orca whale - we followed it for a while - we also saw bald headed eagle mates, sea lions and seals. The weather was kind and there was a good vibe. The staff were eager to share their knowledge and it made for a fun day out. I was surprised to be charged for a bottle of water and that took a bit of the gloss off an otherwise good day.",Date of experience: May 2019,Half-Day Whale Watching Adventure from Vancouver,1,"Vancouver, Canada"
who would have thought it could be so easy?,booked online and jumped on a bus from Vancouver - Victoria - seamless journey with great drivers. I was impressed with the ferries too but what a cattle market to get food - you could be forgiven for thinking that nobody had eaten for days - the queues for all the restaurants were impressive and sadly the food looked dire!! Still - the views and cleanliness and efficiency of the whole experience more than compensated for all this!,Date of experience: May 2019,BC Ferries,1,"Tsawwassen, Canada"
delicious icecream treat,"never had a puff cone before and ""what an experience!"" - scrummy and indulgent - not for the calorie-phobic but such fun :)",Date of visit: May 2019,Popina Cantina,1,"Vancouver, Canada"
fun way to cross the creek,"came across this by chance and thought ""beats walking back over the bridge"" - friendly crew who zipped us across to Yaletown - cool views of the creek and so many people out canoeing, whale watching and just enjoying being on a boat",Date of experience: May 2019,False Creek Ferries,1,"Vancouver, Canada"
place to kill time,"so much to see and so many good places to hang out. Cool shops, hip vibe, friendly staff and a beautiful setting right under the bridge. Definitely a place to return to. The icecream was awesome - a puff cone - totally recommended but not if you are panicking about calories!! amazing food market - such an extravaganza of tastes and colours and promise - :)",Date of experience: May 2019,Granville Island,1,"Vancouver, Canada"
lovely spot on the creek,late lunch in the sun- delicious calamari - good selection of wine and lovely cocktails. Situated on the waterfront so a great place to watch the world go by. Friendly waitress - prompt and attentive :),Date of visit: May 2019,Backstage Lounge,1,"Vancouver, Canada"
fun for a sunny bike ride,shame that so many of the anticipated rest stops were out of service - I could not see how we could have a sunset vista with a relaxing drink if none of these places were open due to construction works,Date of experience: May 2019,Vancouver Seawall,1,"Vancouver, Canada"
well placed for downtown vancouver,comfortable and quiet - but AC was Oh-so-loud and when the sun had heated up the apartment this was definitely needed. I would love if there was ice in the freezer - but clean and safe. Shame to not have access to a roof top garden and breakfast included was really not worth a second look.,Date of stay: May 2019,Riviera on Robson Suites Hotel Downtown Vancouver,1,"Vancouver, Canada"
spectacularly fast service!!,We had hardly sat down before our first course was delivered - very tasty and moist sushi. Great tasting food - not too hefty portions but everything felt a bit too rushed.,Date of visit: May 2019,Ebizo Japanese Restaurant,1,"Vancouver Island, Canada"
lovely finish to a great tour,lovely chowder and great selection of sandwiches and salads - plenty of tables and friendly staff made for good brunch stop.,Date of visit: May 2019,Blue Poppy Restaurant,1,"Vancouver Island, Canada"
words cannot do justice to how amazing these gardens are,"initially taken aback at the cost of entry but all my reservations vanished at the splendour of these gardens - truly inspiring and breathtaking - the tulips, rhododendrons, azaleas and the japanese / sunken gardens - all the fountains- the amount of care that has gone into creating such an incredible floral extravaganza made this all worthwhile - very well done :) The blue cafe had great food choices too - a very pleasant experience all round",Date of experience: May 2019,The Butchart Gardens,1,"Vancouver Island, Canada"
worth a visit,"initially could not find any totem poles but once i realised that the yellow foot prints led us on the totem tour, it became fun to see how varied the different totem poles were. Scattered around the town and all individual.",Date of experience: May 2019,Duncan Totem Poles,1,"Vancouver Island, Canada"
wow come hungry!!,very busy and felt lucky to get a table - good service and reasonable wine choice. Realized that my eyes were bigger than my tum when i had to request a doggy bag because I just could not finish my delicious main course. interesting art work on walls.,Date of visit: May 2019,IL Terrazzo,1,"Vancouver Island, Canada"
best brunch ever,OMG - so hard to pick what to eat - fab fab food and with a morning cocktail of mimosa....perfect start to the day :),Date of visit: May 2019,Jam Cafe,1,"Vancouver Island, Canada"
hoping to get a table...,lovely place and lucky to arrive with a 2 minute wait to get a table since you cant book. Friendly waitress - delicious and prompt service. helpful advice on wines ( I don't know much about French wines and disappointed not be able to choose a Canadian red wine).Initially concerned that the acoustics would preclude conversation but actually once at the table there was nothing to complain about :),Date of visit: May 2019,Brasserie L'ecole,1,"Vancouver Island, Canada"
wow - first class experience,"So easy, so helpful, so friendly - great selection of bikes and felt that nothing was too much trouble - well equipped by excellent friendly staff to take bikes out for a fun day round the park. Thank you :)",Date of experience: May 2019,Spokes Bicycle Rentals,1,"Vancouver, Canada"
pitstop after the park,"having cocktails and beer - with a super friendly waiter - we debated how to pronounce "" gewurtztraminer"" and he was such good fun - he really seemed to care that we had a nice time - refreshing and kind. based on him, we came back for dinner and left a huge tip :)",Date of visit: May 2019,Banana Leaf Malaysian Cuisine,1,"Vancouver, Canada"
wow - what a choice,we made a picnic but struggled to constrain the choice - i cannot believe how easy it is for people to eat healthily in Vancouver - impressive selection of fresh fruit and veg and beautifully presented.,Date of visit: May 2019,Safeway,1,"Vancouver, Canada"
cool hangout :),Loved this little beach which gradually filled up with friends and teens and families lapping up the Canada sunshine and cool vibe of the weekend :),Date of experience: May 2019,Third Beach,1,"Vancouver, Canada"
best way to chill in Vancouver,We hired bikes and lazily pedalled around the park until we found a nice beach to chill on and enjoy our picnic - bit busy at times with people impatient to pass - and the rules on helmets and courtesy seemed to be scantily observed but still a great day out,Date of experience: May 2019,Stanley Park,1,"Vancouver, Canada"
just lovely :),Met up with friends for an informal dinner - great wine - friendly and helpful service - menu varied and appetising and good wine selection - I would definitely come back - the whole experience is what eating out should be about :),Date of visit: May 2019,Earl's On Top,1,"Vancouver, Canada"
great way to see an eclectic movie,"saw ""Free Solo"" as a special viewing and what a great film - comfy seats and perfectly typical viewing of a film but not your ordinary ""blockbuster experience"" - an enterprising way to bring people in and allow them to see less mainstream films.",Date of experience: May 2019,Galaxy Cinemas Midland,1,"Midland, Canada"
totally unexpected,"we came in on spec and were made to feel very welcome - joining a class as novice yoga folk - great instruction, plenty of space and a fun way to unwind. I would never have imagined doing a yoga class but am totally glad that we did :)",Date of experience: May 2019,Retreat Yoga & Wellness,1,"Midland, Canada"
great little find,friendly staff and great designs on the coffee :) cool vibe and wide choice of food that really pleased us for an informal lunch. I liked that I was able to recharge my phone and that the staff sorted out my shuggly table. Selection of wine/ gin and beer hit the spot.,Date of visit: May 2019,Gibson and Company,1,"Collingwood, Canada"
good job I wasn't hungry !!,good find in a town which appeared to have almost nowhere to get a drink outside!! Having believed the guide book that it would be a unique experience to detour into Elora - I cant deny that it was memorable - but for few good reasons - this pub was an oasis but the disinterest of the staff in accommodating us was staggering. We couldn't have anything to eat because they were catering for a large party - having secured a table in the sun I was loathe to move so satisfied myself with just a drink.,Date of visit: May 2019,The Cellar Pub and Grill,1,"Elora, Canada"
surprisingly good,"with jet lag and hunger, this find as perfect - friendly waiters and quick service definitely required when you are exhausted. Great ambience and also fun to people watch. I totally recommend being brave and trying the local wines - I have been pleasantly surprised at how good they taste and how affordable too:)",Date of visit: May 2019,The Keg Steakhouse + Bar Esplanade,1,"Toronto, Canada"
once you have seen one mall....,Huge and samey. Nothing exciting about the shops. Very busy and bustling and a bit soul-less really. cant think why anyone would want to spend any of their holiday traipsing round yet another faceless mall,Date of experience: May 2019,CF Toronto Eaton Centre,1,"Toronto, Canada"
ideal place to unwind on a summer's evening,"It was cold when we were there so we couldn't enjoy sitting out - but we could imagine how lovely it would be - the flowers, the ambience - the quirky shops. We even passed a wedding when we were there. I could have spent longer here",Date of experience: May 2019,Distillery Historic District,1,"Toronto, Canada"
made up by Monet,I was totally beside myself to discover that there was an Impressionist exhibition there - really well laid out and worth paying extra for. Delighted to discover that if you come in through the back entrance you can avoid the crowds queueing for tickets.,Date of experience: May 2019,"The AGO, Art Gallery of Ontario",1,"Toronto, Canada"
not much fun if you are scared of heights!!,"Cited as one of the wonders of the world this had to be done - massively overpriced but undoubtedly the most spectacular view possible of Toronto. Disappointed that there was no option to have brunch there - having gone early to avoid the crowds, we discovered that there was no food served before 11.30!! ( not even coffee) Clean attraction and tick on list.",Date of experience: May 2019,CN Tower,1,"Toronto, Canada"
best venue of the holiday so far :),"just WOW - the fish, the layout, the sharks, the rays - totally amazing and even better to go with kids!! The cafe was totally to be avoided - but we didn't go for the food so I wasn't bothered - and my pet hate with any attractions is to have to trawl through the gift shop to get out - ok if you are an adult but I could but imagine the awfulness of trying to coerce children through the ""Aladdin's cave"" without feeling forced into buying something",Date of experience: May 2019,Ripley's Aquarium of Canada,1,"Toronto, Canada"
chance find having been to the local attractions,"Having visited the CNN tower and the aquarium - and discovered that dining options there were either abysmal or closed ( for brunch) we cruised the vicinity and chanced upon this place. Good menu- slow service - food not bad - cold eggs and steak but excellent fried potatoes. That being said, we were starving - the toronto omelette was well received and again we scored with the potatoes",Date of visit: May 2019,Lucky Clover Sports Pub,1,"Toronto, Canada"
Fab fishy extravaganza,"I love fish but this restaurant made me love it more. Fab service, fab staff, great food and great green wine. You can pick your fish and the price is determined by its weight. Knowledgable staff who will guide your decision and yet don’t just recommend a £££££ choice. I felt taken care of And that our waiter ( Pedro) cared about our whole experience. Fantastic evening worth every penny. Not a cheap meal but OMG “ what a night” - one of my top meals in Lisbon.",Date of visit: January 2019,Sea Me - Peixaria Moderna,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Mixed evening,Sharing a table with strangers seemed a bit daunting but the fun of the group that we joined really made our evening. Great chat and lots of laughs. The ambience of the restaurant was lovely and our hosts were friendly and welcoming. The food was average and the singing unremarkable. The guitarist was superb and his music was a delight. An interesting evening all round.,Date of visit: January 2019,Sr. Fado de Alfama,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
"Easy, clean, efficient",Delighted we ventured into the metro- great way to travel about Lisbon ( although you miss the sights),Date of experience: January 2019,Metropolitano de Lisboa,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Worth the hike,"Caught the train from rossio ( crowded but surprisingly easy ) and used apple maps to guide as to the castle. Winding streets past touristy shops constantly uphill. Good shoes required and sure footing. We detoured through the park and enjoyed a beautiful climb through well groomed gardens with plenty of splendid vistas over Sintra. The path was reasonably well signposted - it would be hard going if slippy. Great sense of achievement to reach the ticket office. Plenty of photo opportunities enroute. You can get tickets inside the castle if you don’t want to wait in a lengthy queue at the car park. A good head for heights is essential once inside- there are few railings to lean on and some precarious steps but, again, spectacular views of the palacia de Pena and Sintra. Totally recommend this attraction.",Date of experience: January 2019,Castelo dos Mouros,1,"Sintra, Portugal"
Good for a quick bite,"We were keen to sample some of the delights of the Time out marketplace but didn’t want to sit in the bustling melee of the market. After wandering around surveying the various options around the outside, we picked this place- partly because there were available seats but also because the menu and presentation of the food looked interesting. Service was quick, polite, friendly and efficient. The appetisers and the food were tasty- beautifully presented. We watched the chef preparing other dishes and marvelled at the Artistry and creativeness. The wine was excellent scoring 4.1 on vivino. Great place for people watching too. Worth a visit.",Date of visit: January 2019,O Surf & Turf,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Spectacular view of lisbon,Pure chance and the joys of trip advisor led us here. Not easy to find unless you know where you are going. Great panoramic views of Lisbon. Friendly service. Interesting selection of cocktails and good wine. We enjoyed a snack with our drinks and soaked up the ambience of a quiet restful rooftop bar- perfect place to unwind.,Date of visit: January 2019,Lumi Rooftop Restaurant & Bar,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Nothing special,I was Pleased to find somewhere easily accessible. The “ smoking area” was fine and in no way detracted from my dinner so don’t be put off by this. Quick efficient and polite service. Food underwhelming but no complaints.,Date of visit: December 2018,Pap'Acorda,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Interesting venue but struggles to match hype,"I like art. However I am no expert. Many of the exhibits were lost on me- I did not understand the intentions of some of the artists and suspect that this might be an unimportant consideration for highbrow art lovers - surely it is not unreasonable for me to want to believe there is an intention for art to be accessible to all? That being said, the exhibit on the plastic pollution was powerful and moving. The inefficiency at the ticket desk was exasperating - to wait 1/2 hour to even gain access to the museum ( when the queue was not huge but just inexpertly managed by one unfortunate but charming assistant ) is disappointing and maybe needs attention.",Date of experience: December 2018,"MAAT - Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology",1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Respite from the buzz,An oasis in a bustle of activity. Great place to snatch some peace on a bench whilst soaking up some sun. Various birds meandering the paths with the odd rogue seagull thinking he had a right to be there.,Date of experience: December 2018,Jardim Botanico Tropical,1,"Belem, Portugal"
Buzzing cool place,We loved the little stalls selling nick nacks- great craftsmanship and great bargains to be had. The bustling vibe of many eating places inside gives a great selection sure to please every palette. The wine store was well stocked with friendly staff to advise. Not intimate but very alive.,Date of experience: December 2018,Time Out Market Lisboa,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Queues can be off putting,Great climb up the hill but a hugely long queue to buy a ticket to get in when the guide book suggests that one only needs to pay for the museum meant we didn’t actually get inside... but the walk up was good,Date of experience: December 2018,Castelo de S. Jorge,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Don’t judge a book by it’s cover,"Now I am not a huge dessert fan although when a good one is introduced to me I will pay attention... I have been advised that their by numerous friends to try the pasteis de Belém.... so I braved the queue( which to be fair was efficient and less than 10 minutes) and persuaded my less queue tolerant partner that we should just “ suck up the wait”... we were not disappointed. The delicious, still warm crispy flaky tarts with a creamy luscious (but not too sweet)filling were divine. Definitely a gastronomic must for everyone before they die.... and I am not a huge pudding fan!!",Date of visit: December 2018,Pastéis de Belém,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Chance discovery,Stumbled in here having just arrived late at our apartment from the airport and it was almost midnight. Very hospitable staff and so knowledgeable about fine wine. We enjoyed a cheese board and some excellent red wine ( that vivino scored highly too). The staff were attentive and helpful without being intrusive. I felt Very chilled out watching the world go past through the window. Definitely planning a return visit here for lunch or dinner this week.,Date of visit: December 2018,The Wine Cellar,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
5 stars doesn't even touch this place,"We came to Burano hoping that we might be able to have lunch here - I was blown away by the beauty of the island way before we chanced upon it and was resigned to not getting a reservation - but chance would have it that we spoke to the grandson - the sommelier who had a distinctly Scottish accent!! He had undertaken part of his training one Edinburgh :) Lady luck smiled on us and he had one table left -we didn't miss an opportunity to explore the local shops before lunch because acquiring many treasures is sure to build an appetite - the welcoming drink of prosecco set a precedent of what to expect - don't get me wrong, I LIKE prosecco - but this prosecco was no ordinary prosecco - it was just the best I had ever had - knowing that Jamie Oliver had been here and raved about the restaurant added to my anticipation - the tagliatelle and spider crab followed by Baked seabass - and the wine - yes Massimiliano knows his trade - delectable wine - this will go down as one of my BEST days ever :)",Date of visit: April 2018,Al Gatto Nero Da Ruggero,1,"Burano, Italy"
Delightful evening,"I am not surprised that this restaurant has such a high rating. Tucked away on a little side street - friendly staff who found us a table outside despite having no reservation. Our plate of mixed seafood was a great starter - the main courses of sole and swordfish were cooked to perfection. We were unsure of the wine so the waitress brought us a small carafe to try - a very persuasive touch - and we upgraded to a full carafe. There staff were friendly and engaging, forgiving us for speaking no Italian - I would recommend this gem.",Date of visit: April 2018,Trattoria Andri,1,"Lido di Venezia, Italy"
first evening in Lido,Friendly restaurant that does much more than pizza. Service was slow but friendly - cool beer always welcome - delicious seafood - tolerant waitress at our lack of Italian - fortunately she was happy to translate the menu!,Date of visit: April 2018,La Cucina,1,"Lido di Venezia, Italy"
moving and an essential part of your visit to NY,"Harrowing, moving and essential for any visitor to NYC. Allow at least 2-3 hours to cover all the exhibits. Watching events of 9/11 unfold again was still as shocking to me as when I watched it on TV 16 years ago. The tributes to all ( the passengers and crew of the ill- fated planes, the first responders and the unfortunate people who were working so early on that day)...all touchingly accounted for so respectfully.",Date of experience: September 2017,The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,1,"New York City, New York"
as much for the art as the people watching,"I had hoped to see more masterpieces on the 5th floor but I enjoyed the Van Gogh, the Monet and the PIcasso pieces on display. The overly officious security were tiresome if you tried to take a photo close to a picture. The cafe was really cool with an eclectic but delicious and filling menu. The shop was AWESOME and we spent at least an hour there doing some early Christmas shopping.",Date of experience: September 2017,The Metropolitan Museum of Art,1,"New York City, New York"
best views of NYC,a sunny day really ensured that we had great views of the city. Shame that there was no notification in advance that the cafe on 65th floor is shut at weekends.Fun watching people take endless selfies,Date of experience: September 2017,Top of the Rock,1,"New York City, New York"
an oasis in the city,Clearly a place to do exercise as seen by the joggers/ cyclists/ skateboarders and cascades of people enjoying the great outdoors. Lots of squirrels frolicking on the grass. Boating on the lake is an absolute must...so much fun and not really hard ( biggest challenge was dodging the hopeless rowers who clogged the first part of the lake),Date of experience: September 2017,Central Park,1,"New York City, New York"
so many people,"we expected a leisurely stroll through this unique park...but there were just so many people to walk past/ follow that this detracted from the joy of being away from the street, That being said, it was well laid out and clearly a lot of thought had gone into developing the pathway.",Date of experience: September 2017,The High Line,1,"New York City, New York"
free views of NYC,We only rode across and back but enjoyed the views of the city and the Statue. Amazing numbers of birds came and perched on the railings when we docked.,Date of experience: September 2017,Staten Island Ferry,1,"New York City, New York"
fab place to people watch,"the iconic displays and throng of bustling people makes this place super busy at all times. Great place to watch all manner of people promoting shows and queueing to attend. The most memorable being a very unsexy (IMHO) bloke giving out fliers for "" sex tips for girls by a gay man"". People very helpful about shows and queueing tips took the headache out of the prospect of having to wait ages for tickets",Date of experience: September 2017,Times Square,1,"New York City, New York"
great place for people watching,Enjoyed especially the visiting artist Raushenberg and the masters on the 5th floor. Great restaurant and helpful staff who made an amazing G&T. However do ask the price of a glass of wine before accepting it..... $24 seems steep even though it was very good. We enjoyed taking part in the workshops. The museum shop was a real find and we bought heaps of early Christmas presents,Date of experience: September 2017,The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA),1,"New York City, New York"
Michael Moore rocks,"Despite not being native Americans, we could appreciate the sentiment and satire of his performance. Entertaining, erudite and provocative.... definitely a challenging show for any Conservatives in the audience. A bit over zealous with the AC in the theatre but a good natured and engaging audience made for an exciting evening. Getting discounted tickets through TKTS added to our pleasure",Date of experience: September 2017,Belasco Theatre,1,"New York City, New York"
the highlight of broadway,"So we had to wait 30 mins to get in but this was worth waiting for. The food was OK but the atmosphere was electric!!! So much energy and fun. We loved the singers and their renditions of both current and popular musical hits. I didn't mind contributing to the "" student fund"" to help pay for their lessons.... we were there for 2 hours and were very well entertained.",Date of visit: September 2017,Ellen's Stardust Diner,1,"New York City, New York"
off the beaten track,"Friendly waiters, informative and good direction on trying some Brazilian wine. Prompt service. Not sure about the fried bananas to accompany the steak but the picanha steak was awesome",Date of visit: September 2017,Brazil Brazil,1,"New York City, New York"
great buzz,burgers were good.... cocktails not bad...busy busy place. Staff were efficient and prompt. I enjoyed the music videos playing whilst we ate and this would definitely be a place to come with young folk,Date of experience: September 2017,Hard Rock Cafe New York,1,"New York City, New York"
beautiful place to watch the sun set,Always very busy so getting a table was challenging. Friendly and fast service. Delicious fish. Friendly cats!,Date of visit: August 2017,Gioma Taverna,1,"Crete, Greece"
the pick of the beaches in Plakias,"easy to find, easy to park, plenty of sand, not too rocky, not too busy, great choice of tavernas...our favourite beach in Crete",Date of experience: August 2017,Damnoni Beach,1,"Crete, Greece"
quiet beach,"Easy strolling distance from accommodation, plenty of sun loungers and umbrellas, not too pebbly. Astounding difference in sea temperature compared to North of island.Water clear but gets deep very quickly.",Date of experience: August 2017,Plakias Beach,1,"Crete, Greece"
this is an attraction?,"Having read about this beach in lonely planet it was a "" must"" ...however we abandoned a perilous drive along the dirt track and eventually found our way to a carpark near the monastery ( access was barely mentioned in the reviews but it was challenging to find). 500 steep steps later we found ourselves on a crowded grubby looking beach. The bar was vastly overpriced with drinks costing at least 2 x that of any other bar visited. Having caught my breath from the scramble down, we almost immediately returned to the not cheap car park",Date of experience: August 2017,Finikas Beach (Palm Beach),1,"Crete, Greece"
great wee find,"Just outside the main town, lovely popular restaurant. Good food. Great fish. Friendly prompt service",Date of visit: August 2017,Tasomanolis,1,"Crete, Greece"
escape from the sun,"having spent the morning on the beach, this was the best place to escape the sun. Prompt service. Great greek salad and the lamb souvlaki was the best I have eaten in Greece.",Date of visit: August 2017,Damnoni Taverna,1,"Crete, Greece"
excellent place to watch the sunset,great place for late dinner on the rocks. Sushi and steaks were excellent. All the food enjoyed by our large group looked divine. Service prompt and friendly. Cute cats,Date of visit: August 2017,Prima Plora,1,"Crete, Greece"
fabulous find,Lovely place for a group meal. Great steaks. Great wines. Great ambience. Prompt service. Friendly staff.Not what I expected and would not have found by accident ( on top of a supermarket) but our hotel barman recommended it.,Date of visit: August 2017,Upano,1,"Crete, Greece"
fab place for a wedding,Beautiful setting and certainly worthy of any celebration. Good food and wine. Friendly service. Lovely ambience,Date of visit: August 2017,Avli,1,"Crete, Greece"
probably the very best Valentine's meal,"Great reception when we arrived and were told that although they were fully booked, they could find us a VIP table:) Entertaining waiting staff and superb menu. Hard to choose really but no disappointments. Great seafood. Fab dessert and all in all a wonderful evening. Would definitely recommend this place",Date of visit: February 2017,Mad Hatters,1,Bermuda
superb rainy day activity,"I did not think that I would find the museum as interesting....really well done. The information and detail about the slavery, the boat races, the evolution of Bermuda was fascinating.",Date of experience: February 2017,National Museum of Bermuda,1,Bermuda
shame it wasn't obvious how much is shut off season,the museum was great ( and open) but it was disappointing to discover that so little was open. The weather wasnt great which didn't help but advance notice of what is available and even a bus timetable would be good,Date of experience: February 2017,Royal Naval Dockyard,1,Bermuda
respite from the weather,We escaped into the warmth from the rain shower and were made very welcome. Great cocktails and an interesting menu. Friendly staff and generally a nice atmosphere. Shame the cinema was closed,Date of visit: February 2017,Frog and Onion Pub,1,Bermuda
great ride,This was a great way to see another aspect of Bermuda as well as a quick way to get to Dockyard. It would be helpful if there was easy information about the ferry schedule ( in Winter) actually displayed outside since we initially believed there were more ferries. So do pick up a timetable. Buying a day ticket was great value because it meant we could jump off the buses and ferries all day without worrying about getting tokens of transfer tickets.,Date of experience: February 2017,"Sea Express Ferry Service, Bermuda",1,Bermuda
quiet night out,Food was very good but eye wateringly expensive and the most expensive mark-up on the wine to date. Slightly over-attentive waiter but the restaurant was so quiet. Good place for a treat but come prepared to spend a lot.,Date of visit: February 2017,Tempest Bistro,1,Bermuda
beautiful escape,"Like all the beaches in Bermuda, this one did not disappoint. Swathes of white sand and aquamarine water.

highlight of our trip so far,"Really exciting and fun day with Mike taking excellent care of us. He showed us to ride """"Western"" and gave us the most responsive horses that we have ever been on for a trail ride. Mike provided good natured banter and was a very friendly guide.

Great replica of the boat and great views,We wandered around here in search of open attractions. I think the Deliverance would be a must for young kids but it was being renovated when we passed.

cute kids to amuse us during coffee,Popped in during our last day in St George. Weather not great so a warming coffee beckoned. I was seriously tempted by the breakfast bagel ( bacon/ eggs/ cheese) but could not justify it so soon after having had breakfast. The owners kids ( who i think are in the photos on the walls) were just too cute and kept us amused whilst we enjoyed our delicious morning coffee. The fancy pieces all looked good but just not enough appetite to do anything justice!,Date of visit: February 2017,Temptations,1,Bermuda
dark and depressing with greasy food,Came here because inspired by all the great ratings. The conch fritters were hot but not really that tasty and instantly regrettable.

Serving staff friendly enough though.,Date of visit: February 2017,The Swizzle Inn Pub & Restuarant,1,Bermuda
beautiful private and gorgeous white sand,we came upon the beach quite by chance. Lovely clear water and crisp white sand.

a break from the tourist trail,Long windy drive road to get up to the village where we abandoned our car . Hike up the hill ( shame the museum at the bottom was shut so we could not get a walking map advising us of which trail to take. Slow hike up the hill for 2.5km to reach a village of sorts .

The Best Day of our holiday,"From the very start of our day out until we left our hosts in the early afternoon, this was just a fantastic experience. We tried our hands at fishing ( harder than it looks!), steering the boat and just enjoying being on board with such hospitable and friendly hosts. Nothing seemed to be any trouble and we were entertained in lavish style...Effi cooked a feast from our catch of fish and plied us with lemonade ( made from her lemons) and wine ( from their own grapes). We swam from the boat to the shore and Dimitri's lovely mother who was with us showed how to have a mud spa on one of the shores.
I could not recommend this more highly for a fun day out...whatever your age and fitness I can guarantee that you will leave feeling as we did, that we had sampled one of the very best experiences to be had in Greece. Big cheer Effi and Dimitri and thankyou for the wonderful memories.",Date of experience: September 2016,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Worth a look,"More extensive menu than we had anticipated from the information by the road. Friendly staff who had relocated from England. Calamari was excellent but chicken course fairly average. Feta starter was lovely, beef stew very tender but uninteresting. Red wine disappointing. Wil stick to white local wine in future.",Date of visit: September 2016,Jerry's Elliniko,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Coffee stop,Beautiful peaceful setting overlooking the harbour. Good coffee. Great place to watch the world go past. Miserable waitress....how could you be sad when the sun is shining?,Date of visit: September 2016,Taverna Dionysos,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Welcome lunch,"Having forgotten our picnic and only discovered this at the half way point of our hike, ...3/4 hour later this was a welcome pit stop. We fed our bread to the fishes who entertained us whilst we waited for a delicious lunch if sea bass and sea bream. The fishes thronged and fought for the bread chunks that we scattered in the harbour... If only we had had a net!
The wine and lunch were worth a mention ... And the lovely cats who hovered begging for scraps of whatever we could spare. Another great place to watch the world go by and listen to the cackles from neighbouring tables. Memorable lunch!",Date of visit: September 2016,Adonis Family Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Not what we expected,The guide book suggested this place would be excellent but it wasn't. Service was ok. Food unremarkable and uninspiring. Wouldn't rush back because too many other restaurants nearby are so much better.,Date of visit: September 2016,Blue Sea,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great for lunch,Friendly helpful staff. Lovely table by the beach. Good sardines. Snapper and Greek salad hit the spot and house wine was more than passable. Would return.,Date of visit: September 2016,Captain Jerry's,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Delightful find,Busy bustling restaurant so took a little time to be served. Very friendly helpful staff who gave the impression that nothing was too much trouble. Delicious fish dishes and interesting wine list. I recommend the octopus starter and followed with the grilled swordfish which did not disappoint.,Date of visit: September 2016,Cozy,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Rainy lunch,Despite the rain we had a sunny warm reception for lunch. Yummy Caesar salad and special flamingo pitta bread sandwich certainly satisfied us. Friendly staff. Clean toilets. Would it hesitate to return.,Date of visit: September 2016,Flamingo,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
You could not make it up...,"complete cock up by customer service meant I was not able to get on my original flight ( purely because I enquired about changing it)...and had to watch the flight take off, despite there being seats available without me because they were not able to over-ride the computer and put me on the flight. Having to spend a night in a crap airport hotel and lose 12 hours of my life did not endear BA to me",Date of travel: June 2016,British Airways,1,World

surprisingly good,Indian cuisine is not my favourite but I would return here. Great service. Delicious food. Not too spicy. Very busy place so clearly booking in advance is advisable. The venison was really memorable,Date of visit: June 2016,The Lochnagar Indian Brasserie,1,"Ballater, United Kingdom"

we loved the wildlife,"Our lodge overlooked the duck pond and we throughly enjoyed watching a family of ducklings gain confidence over the course of the week. Plenty of birds came and visited our balcony during our stay and countless rabbits crossed our paths. The kids were in their element! The facilities were well used and we enjoyed tennis, squash, table tennis and the gym. Great place for a family holiday",Date of experience: June 2016,Craigendarroch,1,"Ballater, United Kingdom"

So lucky to be just on the doorstep,"I have been here a few times recently and have not been at all disappointed. Coming with teenagers or just as a couple, it has not let me down as being a reliably good place to eat. The staff are friendly ( but not "" in your face""), the menu varied and exciting. I can totally recommend the cheeseboard if you have room after everything else. Good wine list.",Date of visit: May 2016,The Terrace Lounge,1,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom"
Never disappoints,"The most outstanding breakfast in the world ever and the benchmark that no other hotel has ever matched.
Dinner also delicious but the portions a little miserly considering the eye-watering prices. A definite "" special event place"" which is so unbelievably decadent and indulgent that you cant fail to feel spoilt just by being there.
Staying at nearby Glenmor Lodge was superb and seriously tempting to consider buying into",Date of visit: May 2016,The Strathearn,1,"Auchterarder, United Kingdom"
The most luxurious timeshare imaginable,"We have been here several times and yet still consider this to be a treat. Nothing is ever too much trouble and the staff go out of their way to make everyone feel special. The hotel facilities are unmatchable from the killer sessions in the gym to the relaxed "" adult only"" bathing area... the croquet... and the restaurants... never disappointing on any level. The golfers had a great time...as did the kids who just loved the kids club. Certainly a place to return to despite the unpredictable weather",Date of stay: May 2016,Glenmor,1,"Auchterarder, United Kingdom"
perfect for after golf,Friendly service. Very popular so don't think you can just pitch up and get a table ( we managed to squeeze in to an area at the back but ate off our knees. Delicious food and great for kids too. Great views over the golf courses.,Date of visit: May 2016,The Dormy,1,"Auchterarder, United Kingdom"
Last supper,Child friendly and prompt service. Disappointing pizza ( lemon wedges just too bitter) but steaks and fish were delicious with excellent wine selection. Friendly service.,Date of visit: April 2016,The Post Office Hotel,1,"Coburg, Australia"
Great for pre cinema dinner,Prompt service but complicated understanding which meals could be had at which time. wish I had chosen scallops because they looked AWESOME. Sea bass was lovely.

fabulous Andy Warhol exhibition,Great opportunity to peruse the AW exhibits. Iconic artist and beautifully displayed. Such a shame about the in appropriate use of the apostrophe in so many permanent signs...either completely absent or put where it wasn't needed..... (i.e. PARENTS room.....surely that should be PARENT'S room?....or is it not important to use Grammar appropriately in a place of education),Date of experience: April 2016,National Gallery of Victoria,1,"Melbourne, Australia"
Last minute lunch,Nice of them to serve us when we turned up at 3 minutes past the end of lunch. ( at 2pm) Lovely waitress. Great beer. Indescribably inedible gloopy soup. Awesome chips made up for it somewhat. The OLDEST pub in Australia... Clearly no change in decor but nice to sit outside and enjoy the lovely view. Heartening to see a bunch of Saturday athletes swilling beer and eating chips but looking athletic and talking about running.,Date of visit: April 2016,The Bush Inn,1,"New Norfolk, Australia"
Glad we didn't pick all the toirs,Our expectations of having an educational extravaganza on such a spectacular site were not totally met. The chAnce to make this truly engaging and interesting on all levels has been missed. Maybe if there were actors/ actresses inrole bringing the place to life it would be more memorable. The guides were enthusiastic but nowhere near as polished as those on Sarah island ( strahan)... More facts and fewer weak attempts at humour would be better. We have no regrets about visiting such a site but regret it being so unmemorable.,Date of experience: April 2016,Port Arthur Historic Site,1,"Port Arthur, Australia"
Mixed service,Lovely lady served us lunch but her fellow staff were a bit unwelcoming. Soup was pretty good but under spiced. Interesting looking desserts. Very slow queue and a bit disorganised. You have a captive market... But it wouldn't encourage people to return to felons for dinner.. Which is a shame because the experience is TOTALLY different,Date of visit: April 2016,Port Cafe - Port Arthur Historic Site,1,"Port Arthur, Australia"
Pretty average really on many levels,Perfect location for visiting Port Arthur Historic Site with it's own private gate. Tired dated rooms and a funny smell in some of the public areas. Slightly scary entering the bar during a football match and being booed as we asked for the wifi code ( because the TV had to be turned down) Room comfortable and clean but extremely poor lighting and some precarious looking wires made us relieved we were not travelling with young children. Breakfast was unremarkable and we didn't try eating anything else there having fallen in love with Felon's Bistro on port Arthur Site. Friendly staff.,Date of stay: April 2016,Port Arthur Motor Inn,1,"Port Arthur, Australia"
Closer to town than we initially thought,Basic but comfortable. Bev very knowledgable and helpful regarding what to do and where to eat. Great to have laundry facilities. Don't shower and have someone run the hot tap elsewhere at the same time ( unless u like a bracing cold flash) Apartment clean and comfortable.,Date of stay: April 2016,Castaway Holiday Apartments,1,"Strahan, Australia"
If you like a buffet then you might like yhis,We didn't appreciate that the gourmet menu was actually a buffet until we had sat down. The best bit was the wine. Lovely Pinot noir. Mixed buffet with lots to sample. I did also like the langoustines but otherwise it was all a bit tired.,Date of visit: April 2016,View 42° Restaurant & Bar,1,"Strahan, Australia"
Stupendous treat,Absolutely loved this and would recommend to anyone. Superb amount of audience participation and huge fun for all. A very talented cast of 3 provided a thoroughly interesting and educational experience which can be enjoyed by everyone of all ages. The complex plot at times was challenging for some but if u can Follow a simple story then u will be entertained.,Date of experience: April 2016,The Ship That Never Was,1,"Strahan, Australia"
Relief to find such a good pitstop,Good coffee. Good service. Excellent looking fine pieces but we were not hungry enough. Handy toilets.Interesting people watching experience when fat bloke ordering a sandwich persuaded his less fat friends to have some tasty pies. Maybe they are now playing catch up.,Date of visit: April 2016,Hungry Wombat Cafe,1,"Derwent Bridge, Australia"
So disappointed that it was shut for the evening,"When we enquired about dinner they said the restaurant was shut ( all the roadside signs screamed "" open"" due to lack of customers. Every restaurant we visited in Strahan was heaving with diners so this seemed surprising. Shame because the menu looked good.",Date of visit: April 2016,Risby Cove,1,"Strahan, Australia"
best breakfast In Tasmania,"Spent 2 nights here as we toured round Tasmania. Great location, well situated for local attractions and amenities. We rated Cataract Gorge and Tamar Cruises as worth exploring. The cooked breakfast is well worth paying the extra $7.
yes the decor is dated but most of Tasmania appears to be in a 1970's timewarp.
Room comfortable and clean. Friendly staff. Useful to have free carpark at hotel.
Free wifi a bonus. The TV offered a selection of recent movies but we never had time to watch any!",Date of stay: April 2016,Balmoral on York,1,"Launceston, Australia"
Coffee stop turned into lunch,"As we drove across Tasmania, this was rated as an unmissable place to stop. Lovely vegetarian quiche and salmon bagel tempted us to stretch beyond coffee. Counter staff not very friendly but the flirty waitress who delivered our order brought a smile to my partner's wee face.",Date of visit: April 2016,Deloraine Deli,1,"Deloraine, Australia"
Delightful self contained cottage,"A great base for visiting Wineglass bay and Freycinet national park. Beautifully situated by the sea. Well equipped but lacking some lightbulbs and frying pans. Laundry facilities welcome. Comfy bed and roomy shower. I wish these places would leave some basic cooking ingredients like oil, salt, pepper and even some dried herbs.",Date of stay: April 2016,Cod Rock Point Apartments,1,"Bicheno, Australia"
worth the walk,"It takes about 15 minutes to reach and we went on a damp day...but it was an atmospheric trek and the waterfall was impressive. Lots of interesting things to read along the way, written by school children",Date of experience: April 2016,Hogarth Falls,1,"Strahan, Australia"
good recommendation from our host,"very popular place...in fact we seemed to have the last table. The waitress was lovely if a bit hashed. Disappointing to find that our starter choice was limited because they had run out of crab. The mains were great, beautifully flavoursome and cooked to perfection. Wine choice was good. we were the last people to leave at 9pm.... cant get used to the early to bed routine here!",Date of visit: April 2016,Bushman's Strahan,1,"Strahan, Australia"
exhilarating climb,i couldnt believe how many Japanese people were hiking up to this lookout point...and so many looked so unfit and so ill-equipped.

Not as good as trip advisor had implied,We were thrilled to get a table at what appeared to be the best restaurant in town... But the food was just not that great. Fairly bland starters and average main courses with non descript wine meant our expectations were not met. Service good and friendly.,Date of visit: April 2016,Larceny Restaurant,1,"Launceston, Australia"
Pleasantly satisfactory on all levels,We meandered up here from our B&B. Friendly staff. Surprisingly delicious meal which we have rated as one of the best in Tassie so far. Wine good too. Definitely a real find.,Date of visit: April 2016,Pasinis Cafe * Wine Bar * Deli,1,"Bicheno, Australia"
We needed some caffeine,"The art gallery was spectacularly uninteresting with nothing that I could ever imagine wanting to hang on my walls. My partner is more sympathetic than me and he could have accepted some of the exhibits as a gift. Having sat for 5 minutes and wondered if we needed to place an order for coffee, we learned from the next table that self service was the only way to proceed. Fortunately the coffee was excellent. Otherwise I could not think of anything positive to say. Good coffee... Which is why we stopped. Yep. Useful to remember that.",Date of visit: April 2016,Scottsdale Art Gallery Cafe,1,"Scottsdale, Australia"
fun way to spend an afternoon,"Only a small group of us but this made the outing more intimate. Bar opened as soon as we boarded. Light hearted banter and commentary from staff as they plied us with muffins,fruit, tea and coffee....or more hefty fare from the bar. Lots of stories about the Tassies.....my favourite being Brady who supported the women!! The wine tasting was great with my favourite being the Pinot Gris. A lovely way to spend a couple of hours seeing a part of the country in comfort. A short trip up Cataract Gorge ended the tour. well worth it and we made some new friends!",Date of experience: April 2016,Tamar River Cruises,1,"Launceston, Australia"
lovely relaxing way to spend the morning,"We wandered down here looking for a spot to have a picnic. Quiet, clean and relaxing. We popped into the conservatory and ambled past the bandstand. Curious statue of a botanist ( with a small posy of fresh flowers in his hands). Out of the wind and a chance to get some sun.I would have loved to find a little coffee shop here.",Date of experience: April 2016,City Park,1,"Launceston, Australia"
worth the walk,We chose the testing zigzag climb to get to the gorge and stopped for a wee picnic en route. We were entertained by a lovely friendly local dog ( Goodie) who enticed us to throwing many sticks for her. The views on route were not desperately rewarding until we reached the end and were greeted by the pool and the lawns....suddenly we were enchanted and could understand why the guidebook raved about the attraction. A truly beautiful spot. We loved the chairlift which allowed us spectacular views of the gorge and then enjoyed a more leisurely stroll back into town. Lovely way to spend the afternoon.,Date of experience: April 2016,Cataract Gorge Reserve,1,"Launceston, Australia"
pitstop for a wee glass of something,at the end of our walk this venue was perfect for a wee drink...friendly staff and good choice of wine and beer. Out of the wind and lovely view of the river,Date of visit: April 2016,Levee Food,1,"Launceston, Australia"
great for steak,"We shared a delicious ribeye steak, with sweet potato and carrots on the side. Wine overpriced and not good value.Good ambience and vibrant atmosphere, but background noise not so loud that we couldn't have a quiet conversation. An expensive dinner but if you like steak then you wont be disappointed.",Date of visit: April 2016,Black Cow Bistro,1,"Launceston, Australia"
The best meal we have had in Australia,"Having won a small bet with dinner as the prize, I wanted somewhere amazing. Monty's did not disappoint. We enjoyed the Tasting menu with accompanying wine. We were presented with delicacy after delicacy, (terrine, salmon, asparagus, lobster, beef, pannacotta) all balanced by perfect wine choices. We were initially seated beside an enthusiastic slightly loud wedding party but were quickly moved into a quieter part of the restaurant ( without asking to be, just invited) The service was superb with knowledgable staff who explained each course and wine in detail. A truly memorable evening and highly recommended venue.",Date of visit: April 2016,Hearth,1,"Hobart, Australia"
quirky and interesting,"many different artists were showcased, being well displayed throughout the buildings. I loved the fairy shop. The eclectic artists were often in residence and very willing to engage with any browser. Offerings varied from fine cheese and gourmet deli's to knitting shops and wood carvings. A curiosity if nothing else.",Date of experience: April 2016,Salamanca Arts Centre,1,"Hobart, Australia"
surprising venue,"We came in purely to catch the ferry to Mona and were surprised to find a collection of little stalls and eateries inside. Pleasantly laid out, the pier was airy and light. Easy to get a bit lost because there wasn't much signage. Clean and inviting with a couple of trendy coffee/ wine bars to tempt one in",Date of experience: April 2016,Brooke Street Pier,1,"Hobart, Australia"
Cheap and cheerful,"Situated above a gaming bar and pub I did have my reservations about the potential quality of our stay but everything downstairs shut at 9pm so there was never any noise. We were able to park in a nearby multi-storey car park. The room was clean and comfortable but a little dark. The breakfast was surprisingly good. The location was great, closely situated to the harbour and many attractions. Certainly a no frills place but excellent value for money",Date of stay: April 2016,Central Hotel Hobart,1,"Hobart, Australia"
eye-opening and eye-watering all at once,"Lovely ferry trip each way, curious exhibition with some superb exhibits ( the water words), some astonishing anatomically accurate depictions of female genitalia, a moving picture of immigrants, a disturbing collage relating to Bosnian rapes and a creepy montage called ""loved"" made me feel I was on the scene of a horror movie.....plenty to look at, enjoy, be challenged by and also cause to reflect ""is this really art?""
Th hand held tour device was both a blessing and a curse...loads of information but sometimes distracting and not easy to work. Lovely cafe and good wine, with trendy chairs to relax into at the end of the tour. Dont forget your rucksacks ( if you put them into the lockers)...we nearly did!! Worth visiting",Date of experience: April 2016,Museum of Old and New Art (Mona),1,"Berriedale, Australia"
eclectic and busy way to spend a saturday,"so many different stalls selling everything from woollie hats to twirling mobiles. Variety of different foodie stalls, catering for a multinational palate. Bustling and vibrant, sheltered from the wind",Date of experience: April 2016,Salamanca Market,1,"Hobart, Australia"
Off the beaten track,"Given the opportunity to see some of the less obvious sights of Sydney in the company of our native guide, this did not disappoint. Great views of the harbour, spectacular and not so stunning waterside houses. Amusing birds sang to us, one sounding like a crying cat. Creative use of and old gas works. Good place for a picnic",Date of experience: March 2016,Ballast Point Park,1,"Birchgrove, Australia"
an excellent place to escape the rain,"Disappointingly we arrived in Sydney to dark skies and rain...so were delighted to find this lovely harbourside bar where we could enjoy a late lunch and some happy hour wine until the rain stopped. Lovely waitress, also from Scotland took great care of us. Fun watching the seagulls",Date of visit: March 2016,Cyren Bar Grill Seafood,1,"Sydney, Australia"
lovely walk with awesome views,"We wandered past the Opera house, round the Botanic Gardens, looking back at the amazing views of the bridge and the Opera House. Countless joggers zipped past us...and in the heat of the day too. A lovely way to soak up the environment, we also admired the set of the Japanese Opera, set up along the way",Date of experience: March 2016,Mrs Macquarie's Chair,1,"Sydney, Australia"
great location for people watching,"despite the slow and slightly unfriendly service, the food was good and well presented and priced. We enjoyed watching the boats coming and going, the sweaty joggers and the seemingly unending stream of aesthetically challenged tourists passing. A thoroughly enjoyable way to have brunch.",Date of visit: March 2016,Eastbank Cafe Bar Pizzeria,1,"Sydney, Australia"
lovely walk in the afternoon sun,"worth the effort to meander round the opera house, beside the botanics and along to MacQuarries point. It took about 45 minutes but then we were not jogging....what do these joggers do all day when they are not jogging? Nice ice-cream place at MacQuarries point",Date of experience: March 2016,The Opera House to the Botanic Gardens Walk,1,"Sydney, Australia"
unexpectedly nice,"we were spectacularly underwhelmed when we arrived especially since Lonely Planet had so highly recommended it. It was nearly impossible to find and it was quiet going on moribund. However the food was really delicious and the quiet empty ambience meant we could chill, chat, relax and stretch out on the comfortable seating area. Fine place to go if you want to escape any sort of noisiness.",Date of visit: March 2016,Bungalow 8,1,"Sydney, Australia"
great find for lunch,Eclectic home cooking on the menu. Great choice of fine homebakes inside. Clearly best to be seated outside because tight for space inside. Very slow queueing system to order food but it did arrive promptly. An Aladdin's cave full of delectable delicacies...lovely gourmet deli food. Worth a visit,Date of visit: March 2016,Annie's Provedore,1,"Barwon Heads, Australia"
Great stop for coffee and very kid friendly,Seating out the back with a little play area makes this an ideal stopping place to refuel when out. Mind-blowingly slow queue. Waiter service would have been so much better. Lovely coffee and home-bakes. Surprising to have a 15% surcharge added on just because we went on Easter Sunday. Friendly staff with eclectic hairstyles and tattoos added to the exciting atmosphere,Date of visit: March 2016,Cafe Moby,1,"Torquay, Australia"
well thought out and well equipped,Great kid friendly place for lunch. Plenty of toys/ games to amuse young kids within sight of the resting adults. Friendly staff. Good choice of wine. Salt and pepper calamari a very popular choice.,Date of visit: March 2016,Harry's Kiosk,1,"Queenscliff, Australia"
wow what a find,"Superb atmosphere and ambience inside. Pizza was delicious, as was the burger and the chicken salad. Having a wine tasting session prior to lunch was ideal. The pinot noir was our favourite and perfectly accompanied our lunch. I gather that the view from the toilets was impressive with a hen run to amuse.",Date of visit: March 2016,Clyde Park Vineyard Bistro,1,"Bannockburn, Australia"
worth a look,We popped in whilst doing some shopping. Interesting selection of art with friendly staff to advise. Plenty to look at and a variety of different mediums on display,Date of experience: March 2016,Seaview Gallery,1,"Queenscliff, Australia"
Pit stop on cold bike ride,We were freezing cold and in desperate need of some hot sustenance last Sunday lunchtime. The place was packed and all the food looked great. the vegetable broth hit the spot and it was served promptly with delicious bread. I have never explored the shop but it looks very similar to the other up-market garden centres.,Date of visit: March 2016,The Mains of Drum,1,"Banchory, United Kingdom"
always a delight,"Popped by for lunch. The food was delicious, great service. I enjoyed perusing the art on the wall, all painted by the owner, Steve. The waitress was attentive, turning the music down when requested...( the selection was great, we were just sat too near a speaker) the whole experience was just lovely and I will definitely be back.",Date of visit: March 2016,Cafe 52,1,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom"
Great venue for cosy dinner,"There are not many places in Anstruther that really do good food.....the menu here was extensive and exciting, the food was delicious and the staff were attentive enough without being intrusive. I will most definitely return.",Date of visit: February 2016,The Rockies Restaurant,1,"Anstruther, United Kingdom"
in the middle of nowhere,"We popped in on the off chance of getting some lunch. Delicious food, great service and really exquisite looking home-bakes. A great venue if out walking in the hills or a welcome stop-off point when on a bike ride. Friendly staff and beautiful views. A real gem",Date of visit: March 2016,Clatterin Brig Restaurant,1,"Laurencekirk, United Kingdom"
Great venue for quick lunch,"Visited here en route to Belmont Cinema. Great ambience with really friendly staff. HUGE coffee cups. Soup and sandwich for lunch, both very good. I would certainly return.",Date of visit: March 2016,The Coffee House,1,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom"
not really at Terminal 5,"Discovering that the hotel was a £25 taxi ride away or £5 bus ride from terminal 5 did not impress me. The room was clean but cold. Ordering a morning newspaper was an ordeal, with the reception staff telling me that 'i' was not a daily newspaper (eventually spoke to someone who was able to organise this). Breakfast was unremarkable. Porridge took forever to arrive and was virtually inedible.",Date of stay: February 2016,Hilton London Heathrow Airport Terminal 5,1,"Colnbrook, United Kingdom"
Birthday Fun,"My son's choice of venue for a family dinner to celebrate his 18th. Prompt friendly service. Great food. Great wine, I love the sea bass! I provided a cake which the staff presented with enthusiasm and I think my son may eventually forgive me for such a public celebration.This is definitely the best Italian in town.",Date of visit: February 2016,Amarone Aberdeen,1,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom"
terrible breakfast,No frills hotel but conveniently based for train station and town centre. The room was fairly basic but clean and I had a good night's sleep. The breakfast was awful. The requested poached eggs were hard and it took a long time for freshly cooked ones to arrive. The tea and coffee was stewed and poured out of flasks. I felt like I was in student accommodation or a youth hostel. The staff were pleasant but fairly vacant when it came to responding to requests.,Date of stay: February 2016,Park Plaza Leeds,1,"Leeds, United Kingdom"
great place to catch up with friends,Good choice of gin. Friendly staff. Good menu and wide selection of wine. The food arrived promptly. The lobster and steak combo was delicious. Good atmosphere and lively buzz about the place. I would come here again.,Date of visit: February 2016,The Restaurant Bar & Grill Leeds,1,"Leeds, United Kingdom"
dire for breakfast,really disappointing breakfast. Hard eggs. Slow service. Food left too long under the lights. It reminded me of the horrors of the little Chef from 20 years ago,Date of visit: February 2016,Chino Latino,1,"Leeds, United Kingdom"
Fab cocktails,Great place to come for the end of an evening. An exciting array of cocktails beautifully presented. I even got to keep my hip flask. Shame it shut so early.,Date of visit: February 2016,The Alchemist - Trinity,1,"Leeds, United Kingdom"
best place to walk the dog,"I have enjoyed many walks along this beautiful beach...I have even run along the sands with the theme tune of ""Chariots of Fire"" playing in my head. My dog loves it here too and there are usually an endless supply of sticks to throw into the waves for her to retrieve.",Date of experience: February 2016,St Andrews West Sands Beach,1,"St. Andrews, United Kingdom"
Great place for lunch,"Excellent venue with interested staff. Impressive selection of gin ( I enjoyed the local Eden Mill HOP gin) but shame they have not yet discovered FEVERTREE tonic. Varied and enticing menu meant choosing what to eat was not easy. The service was prompt and I was allowed to slightly vary the menu having salad with the delicious Arnold Bennett Omelette. The views of the surrounding golf courses (Jubilee and Old Course) were impressive. The restaurant has a light airy feel with a friendly ambience catering for young families, couples and groups of friends on an outing. Certainly somewhere I would return to.",Date of visit: February 2016,The Swilcan Lounge,1,"St. Andrews, United Kingdom"

Great venue in great location,I have been here on many occasions over the years.

You have to be speedy to get to the bar during the interval.,Date of experience: December 2015,Aberdeen Music Hall,1,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom"
Great recommendation,"Very popular Italian restaurant overlooking the Amstel river. Lovely ambience and delicious food. Service slow to start with but generally attentive and friendly waitresses.
Excellent wine to accompany the meal and the right sort of acoustics to be intimate...no need to shout above any background music or whisper. Not a cheap dinner but an enjoyable meal nevertheless. I would return.",Date of visit: December 2015,Incanto,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
beautiful park,Lovely park to walk around. Clean and spacious. Can see how perfect it would be for running or cycling around and can imagine would be an idyllic picnic spot in fine weather. Although we didn't try any of the cafes I can see how pleasant it would be to escape the bustle of the city,Date of experience: December 2015,Vondelpark,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
amusing just because it was so awful,"Our guidebook had raved about this place claiming it provided a unique opportunity to watch skilled horsemanship from an elegant cafe...... the smell of fresh hay confirmed we were in the right place...but we had to search for any horses ( found in their stalls). The only actual moving horse we saw was being led out of the arena. Nobody could confirm whether there were any lessons to be seen...so we sat drinking our coffee ( which was pretty mediocre) overlooking a grand arena.
When we enquired about any actual equestrian activities, the disinterested owners ( who were passing reception at the time), refused to engage in any conversation in English and we were summarily dismissed with a refund. My biggest regret was to have wasted any of my valuable holiday time in visiting the venue.",Date of experience: December 2015,Levend Paardenmuseum De Hollandsche Manege,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Fascinating and thought provoking,"Wandering through the red light district we chanced upon this gem. Not expensive and very informative. Without being at all judgemental it gave a very factual overview of the sex industry, highlighting the efforts to regulate it and reduce exploitation. I got the impression that the only person who really gained any satisfaction from her job had become an S&M specialist, which made her feel more in control of her situation. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in being more than just a voyeur of the red light district. It certainly made me think and reflect on the experiences of the working girls.",Date of experience: December 2015,Museum of Prostitution - Red Light Secrets,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
a must-see part of amsterdam,"Not difficult to find and a fascinating distraction as you walk along the streets. Many beautiful girls, some looking bored as they texted. Absolutely recommend visiting the Museum of Prostitution to get an understanding and perhaps change your view of the industry. Some seedy sex shops selling nothing unmissable.",Date of experience: December 2015,Red Light District,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
disappointing,"Having thought there would be lots of art from well known artists, I was disappointed to find so few. ( Van Gogh/ Chagali and Picasso being the highlights) This was very much a second best for me since i had really wanted to visit the van Gogh but could not face a 3 hour queue.
There was a very bizarre "" living art"" exhibit which appeared to be a man walking backwards and a woman writhing around the floor.",Date of experience: December 2015,Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
curiosity lead me in here,We elected not to join any guided tour but just wandered about looking at the various exhibits. Seeing a replica of the Koh-I-Noor was interesting. Looking at all the different colours and shapes of the different jewels was interesting. I was surprised at the number of small shops tagged on but felt no inclination to buy anything,Date of experience: December 2015,Royal Coster Diamonds,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
efficient and clean,"passing through en route to and from Schipol, this would have been an easily place to get lost. However the clear signage and efficient service with automated booths have encouraged me to not hesitate to use the trains again",Date of experience: December 2015,Centraal Station,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
no atmosphere,Food tasty and flamboyant waiter were fun. Good wine list but harsh lighting and lack of atmosphere mean it wouldnt be a first choice,Date of visit: October 2015,Waterfront Restaurant,1,"Anstruther, United Kingdom"
definitely the best place for any special occasion,"The tasting menu paired with wine makes this one of the most superb places to eat in Fife. Everything about this place explain why a booking has to be made so far in advance. The ambience, the staff, the location...none of it can be beaten",Date of visit: July 2015,Cellar,1,"Anstruther, United Kingdom"
surprisingly good,Varied menu with not too large portions. Accommodating waitress was charming and didn't mind me footering with the menu ( I wanted potatoes rather than pasta). Prompt service and enjoyable meal. Ambience was good and seems popular with the locals,Date of visit: January 2016,The Bank,1,"Anstruther, United Kingdom"
Truly magnificent,Great place to come with friends. Almost private dining experience and was actually hard to choose what to eat. Nobody was disappointed with their choices. Lovely location and the restaurant happy to sort taxis. We will return.,Date of visit: November 2015,Craig Millar @ 16 West End,1,"St Monans, United Kingdom"
hidden gem,Definitely one of the best Indian meals I have ever had. Reasonable wine and beer selection. Attentive waiting staff. Garlic chicken tikka was simply delicious.,Date of visit: January 2016,Eastern Touch at Anstruther,1,"Anstruther, United Kingdom"
Birthday fun,Convenient place for a birthday lunch.Good views on a clear day. Accommodating for young children although service could have been quicker for him since he needed distracting. Interesting gins.,Date of visit: October 2015,The Rockies Restaurant,1,"Anstruther, United Kingdom"
good for a bad weather day,visited with friends. Interesting tour learning how whisky is made and the background to the Distillery. Fun to taste the whisky and debate whether or not to invest in the cask,Date of experience: November 2015,Kingsbarns Distillery and Visitor Centre,1,"Kingsbarns, United Kingdom"
great for gifts ( even for oneself),Popped in just before Christmas to pick up some presents and was not disappointed by the selection of beautiful pieces. My only problem was what to choose and not be too distracted with picking things for me,Date of experience: December 2015,Crail Pottery,1,"Crail, United Kingdom"
hidden gem,We chanced upon this lovely restaurant as we were wandering through the Amsterdam streets. Very friendly staff who made great recommendations on what to eat. Good wine list and a delicious meal. We shared a banquet but did not feel overfull by the time we had finished.,Date of visit: December 2015,Krua Thai Classic Restaurant,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Stupendous experience,Chanced upon this place when driving through Zakynthos. Charming Yanni could not have made it more fun. A leisurely ride to the beach through olive groves ( we were grateful for the shade from the midday sun) and then the joy of swimming with the horses. Yanni clearly has a great sense of fun and encouraged the horses to leap around in the water...which meant we fell off. Huge fun and sense of achievement in managing to stay on the horse ( even for just a little time) and lots of laughs. One of the most memorable days of our trip,Date of experience: September 2015,Parashis Zakynthian Horse Stud - Yannis horses,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
good base for cape town,"we stayed here over the New Year. Some of the staff were amazingly helpful in organising finer details of our trip whilst others seemed more obstructive and resentful, appearing pleased to inform us that venues were fully booked. Overall this negative attitude amused and entertained us because we generally managed to sort something out despite him. Comfortable hotel and bed. Shame the pool was almost never in sunlight. Waterfront was within walking distance although not as close as the brochure would suggest ( good 20 minute walk)",Date of stay: December 2015,Southern Sun Waterfront Cape Town,1,"Cape Town Central, South Africa"
