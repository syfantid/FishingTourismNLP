Friendly restaurant!,"Nice local restaurant with terrace, typical food and very warm and lovely host! We had the meatballs (wifeâ€™s secret receipe) and lamb with potatos. Everything was so good and tasty.
If you want to stay away from the tourists trap places and feel some real Greek vibes, then we definitely recommend this taverna.",Date of visit: October 2019,Plakiotiki Gonia Taverna-Ouzeri,3,"Milos, Greece"
Amanzing fishing boat trip in Poliegos!,"We had such a great time during our excursion together with Niko and his Wife and their team!
Very intimate boat trip (10 people), great fresh and tasty food (0km fish - we ate all fish fished by the boat fisher during the morning!), wonderful blue crystal water and last but not least Niko and his wife have been super hosts, so lovely and nice, always taking care of us!
If you look for a very genuine experience and incredibile spots around the island, you could not desire anything better!
Highly recommended!",Date of experience: October 2019,Milos Fishing Experience,3,"Milos, Greece"
Terrific place!,"The village is located just 50meters from the wonderful an bang beach. The rooms are really nice and well refined. The staff is so lovely and has always a good tip for everything you may need. You can rent bicycles for free. I can say it was the best accomodation in our trip in vietnam. I can't recommend it highly enough!
