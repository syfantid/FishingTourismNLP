Daily room service cleaning is terrible,"The janitors are not professional at all. I tried my best to make the room clean and not make a mess.
The first day, I found some hair still stick on the bath tub. Sometimes tea or coffee are not refilled. Sometimes trash bin is not emptied. I once even found the beds are not made.

Thatâ€™s not respectful to the guest.
If you stayed for long time, stay away from this hotel.",Date of stay: February 2018,Hilton Garden Inn Albany / SUNY Area,1,"Albany, New York"
Strongly recommend: Most memorable experience in Kefalonia,"The tour itself is really fun, we started at 8am and she served us a Greek coffee with her homemade cake which is made from eggs from her farm. and we sail for 30 mins and arrive in that spot and starts to pull the net. Then we sail to another location which is good for swimming while she is preparing lunch. The potato salad, green salad and especially the garlic mashed potato is so delicious. We also delicious fresh fried fishes. Really wonderful.
In addition, Michalis is really welcoming host. She responded to messengers super fast, always within one day even, less in 1 hour. The part I especially like is she really spend time to explain the process of the tour like in chat, not just ask you to check their page. It just feels like you are so welcomed. She checked the weather 2 days and stayed connected. After the tour, she sent us photos immediately in the same day. She only takes up to 12 guest. The size is just right to to cozy and relax.",Date of experience: June 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
