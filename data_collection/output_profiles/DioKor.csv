Capten Andreas experience,"Last day at Milos...We had go to the most beaches in the island the previous days
and we were surprised by the beauty of the island and got the greatest moments.
But we were wrong.Capten Andreas had others plans for us.We had arrange with him
a trip over Polyaigo,an island near Milos.
Was one of the best experience in our lives.I have a lot to say but these things
that made all this unique was the incredible sea with turquoise water,the delicious
spaghetti with shrimps inside the vessel cooked by Capten,the wild beautiness
of the caves and rocks and of course Capten Andreas with his authentic smile
who love this so it cant be less than perfect!
Try this and you wont lose for sure!",Date of experience: August 2020,Milos Poseidon Boat Fishing & Tours,5,"Milos, Greece"
