My favourite place summer autumn winter or spring,"Marina's market and Aeolos bar has been a regular place for us in Spartia over the last 8 years. Marina and her family have helped us to integrate into the village in many ways - customs, language and local advice. Even in winter when most of the island closes down the market shop remains open and we are still welcomed into their snug for a chat, an update and a drink. Well worth a visit.",Date of visit: July 2016,Aeolos Coffee - Bar,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
