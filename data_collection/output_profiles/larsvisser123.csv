Rib cruise,Most genuine and friendly crew/people we’ve met on Rhodes. Went for two tours one 4 hour tour which was a lot fun we got free drinks and visited some nice beaches. The second time we went all the way to lindos and we saw beaches we would have never seen if it weren’t for the tour. We all felt that we got what we payed for and way more and could even say this made our vacation :),Date of experience: July 2020,Adventure RIB VIP Cruises,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
