Amazing Trip,We found this trip via trip advisor and after reading the amazing reviews we decided to book ourselves. I have 2 sons aged 7 & 11... we began by pulling up the nets dropped that day and it was really fun seeing all the different types of fish that had been caught... Antonia kindly explained to us all the different names & levels of poison which my boys really enjoyed. We then anchored at a beautiful spot with crystal clear water where we could swim & dive from the boat - again an amazing experience. The lobster & fish we caught were being cooked meanwhile then we all sat and ate the most DELICIOUS meal of my entire holiday & the BEST lobster i have ever tasted!! ( I am still dreaming of it now ) we drank some wine and by the end of the trip everyone was the best of friends even tho we didn’t speak the same language as the other guests! The trip was about 5 hours 30 mins and the time flew by.. i was slightly worried my sons would get bored but they didn’t and never moaned once (which is incredible in itself ) all in all I would totally recommend spending time with Antonia & Michalis - if we return to Kefalonia they will be top of our list to visit.,Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
