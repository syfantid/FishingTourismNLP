lekker weekje weg,"camping is niet groot, dus rustig. Heb een chalet voor 6-8 personen gehuurd. Dit was groot genoeg voor 4 personen. 1 persoon werd ziek in de vakantie en de manager en ambulance medewerkers waren er snel bij.
Omgeving was top. Locatie goed voor het strand en alle museum/attracties.",Date of stay: August 2020,Camping Omaha Beach,1,"Vierville-sur-Mer, France"
An enjoyable week skiing for the family,"A great area of plenty of blue slopes, perfect. Even fresh snow in April after Easter holiday. Good connections to all areas",Date of experience: April 2019,La Plagne Ski Resort,1,"Macot-la-Plagne, France"
A great restaurant not to be missed,"Fantastic food and wine, staff were lovely and very accomodating with my nut allergy. The lamb is a must and the kids loved the cheese raclette. A very enjoyable evening meal in a small, cosy restaurant.",Date of visit: April 2019,Au Coin du Feu,1,"Macot-la-Plagne, France"
pizzaa were delicious on a sunny terrace,"This was the last few days of season so some meals weren't available, but the pizzas were great! And the staff were lovely and friendly",Date of visit: April 2019,Le Monica's,1,"Macot-la-Plagne, France"
Ski holiday in April,"Lovely hotel, had 2 rooms with adjoining door. Perfect for a family of four. Appartment was clean upon arrival and spacious. Beds were comfortable. Kitchen was basic , we brought some basic essentials with us. We booked a week before we went so we didn't get a sunny balcony, bu we did enjoy a few afternoons on the terrace in the sun with a couple of beers.
Even though it was the last week of the ski season we did enjoy the slopes they were prepared well and even enjoyed the fresh snowfall before we left. Bergerie slope was perfect for getting on the slopes everyday and the connections were good to to get to other areas. We had to pay for the steam room which was unexpected as I thought it came with the booking. Pool area was busy but lovely and warm after a day of skiing.
As it was the last week of the ski season the local Spar was pretty empty of stock and some restaurants closed after the easter weekend.
It wasn't extremely busy on the slopes either. A thoroughly enjoyable week skiing had by all.",Date of stay: April 2019,Residence Prestige Odalys Front de Neige,1,"Macot-la-Plagne, France"
Fab place to visit for lunch or dinner or just a drink,"We loved it here. Gt location, staff are friendly and food was delicious. A very busy buzzy place. Lots of flies, but you cant do anything about that because of the food smells.",Date of visit: October 2018,Chiringuito Punta de Lomas,1,"Cartagena, Spain"
Pannekoekenboot..perfect for a rainy day,"Pancakes were delicious, boat was clean and the staff really friendly. Lots. of families onboard too. Boat was on time.",,Pannenkoekenboot Rotterdam,1,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands"
One of the best,"Location, food, service and staff were the best. Loved it here. The grilled octopus was to die for and the best that we've had in a weeks holiday here in paradise. The walk to here and the beach is worth every step.",Date of visit: June 2018,Remezzo,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Best part of the holiday,"We had a fantastic time with crew and another couple, nearly a private tour!. We had fab food, crystal clear and calm waters for snorkelling, a fab fishing experience, catching all types of fish and octopus.. we will definitely do it again with the kids next time.. if you fancy a boat trip i would recommend this above anything else.",Date of experience: June 2018,Giorgaros fishing tours Santorini,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Great ski holiday with the family,"Before we left for the holiday we were a little worried about the hotel, but it was absolutely fine. Yes the stairwell was not painted and there were no hooks in the boot locker still, but it didn't disappoint. The reception was busy at check-in but that was expected. The appartment was perfect, enough space to hang everything up and store away and it was spotless upon our arrival. There were plenty of plugs for all the electronics and we had free wifi in the appartment (think this is not a permanent thing). There wasn't any surface to prepare food on, just a sink and the electric hob!. But the kitchen table was big enough. We were in C block, the entrance closest to the piste, we had to go outside the building to get to the reception (also where the pool/fitness) was. Not such a big deal as there was not much time left over to go swimming after a full day ski-ing!
The ski-lifts are a very short walk up hill. You can take a conveyor belt lift up to the main lifts or walk, the little lift is handy for the children or if your carrying all the ski stuff for the kids. Parking was easy to find behind the hotel, we didn't even attempt to get in the underground car park, it wasn't really necessary.
The slopes around the village were really great, plenty to do and great to learn on. The slopes of alpe d'huez are easily reached and also a great area to ski, but much busier than in the Aurea village. Staff at the ski school were very friendly and they spoke english at various levels. During holiday times it's better to pre-book, we didn't and ended up with afternoon lessons, we didn't mind but if you do then definitely pre-book. All in all a great ski holiday with the kids.",Date of stay: February 2016,Résidence Odalys Les Balcons d'Auréa,1,"Auris, France"
ski holiday 1 night stop over,"Absolutely fine for a nights stop on the way to the alps. It was clean and comfy. We had two rooms booked and got it with a room dividing door, so we could keep an eye on the kids. It wasn't noisy and the parking was safe and well lit. We didn""t book breakfast as there was a big supermarket close by for some french pastries and snacks for the rest of the journey.",Date of stay: February 2016,Ibis Budget Nuits Saint Georges,1,"Nuits-Saint-Georges, France"
one night stay on return trip from ski-ing,"This was a last minute booking as decided to split the return journey into two days because of traffic warnings. This was a quiet room overlooking the carpark. All the necessary amenities for an overnight stay. The room was clean and had towels and soap, so we only needed an small overnight bag in the room. Parking was safe and well lit. Breakfast looked busy the next day, but we opted for the local bakery for breakfast. The local supermarkets (lidl/carrefour)opened at 830 on the saturday morning for the travel snacks/drinks.",Date of stay: February 2016,Ibis Budget Dijon Saint Apollinaire,1,"Saint-Apollinaire, France"
Smelly Hotel,"Should've looked on trip advisor before booking. This was a planned one night stop on the way for a skiing holiday with children. We have stayed in a F1 before and was impressed at the cleanliness and thought we'd do the same this yr. The reception stunk of sewage and the rest of the hotel stunk of stale smoke.
We ate breakfast (french bread and jam) and departed very quckly.We couldn't wait to get into our new hotel and shower of the stench.",Date of stay: February 2015,HotelF1 Mulhouse Nord Kingersheim,1,"Kingersheim, France"
Enjoyable 5 day ski holiday,"Hotel was clean, personnel were very helpful and friendly, food was enjoyable and varied. Accomodated my nut allergy and intolerences. leysin was a non busy ski area for the school holidays, hardly any queues at lifts, free bus to the ski station but left too late for the start of the ski lessons so had to walk up hill with all the skis, which was a morning warm up work out.
Free wifi in reception area with seating areas. min pt no free wifi in rooms",Date of stay: February 2015,Alpine Classic Hotel Leysin,1,"Leysin, Switzerland"
This shouldn't be allowed to run as a guest house!,"I feel sorry for anyone who stays here. It shouldn't exist. The twin room booked was without a toilet, had to move to a single room because this had a toilet en-suite. The room had no heating and was cold, thankfully the temperature outside was above zero! The shower had a minimum pressure. The smell was musty. No hairdryer in room and no satellite tv, phone etc. To get any service you have to press a bell, but they responded only 1 from the 4 times. Asked to have heating put on, but this never happened.
Even if this was the only room available in Birmingham I still wouldn't recommend it.",Date of stay: February 2011,Charde Guest House,1,"Birmingham, United Kingdom"
