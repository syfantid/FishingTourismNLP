The most romantic spot for a honeymoon!,"My husband and I spent our honeymoon here and it was absolutely incredible! So romantic and amazing private views! The staff was attentive, friendly, and helpful! We were taken care of very well, especially by the front desk receptionist, Chariton! He helped us get a last minute dinner reservation when the one we had made fell through and arranged numerous taxi rides for us! He was just fantastic! The breakfast that was delivered to your own private villa was to die for (complete with champagne) !

Best part of our honeymoon!,"This fishing tour was the best part of our honeymoon! Our captain was this amazing woman who had been fishing all her life and she had lived right on the ocean with her family! She knew everything about the area and had so much knowledge and experience! We caught shrimp, eels, octopus, and a number of other fish! They had unlimited local wine and beer and appetizers for us while they cooked up all the fresh fish we had just caught!!!
