Nice meal,We ordered much to much food but finished it all which says something. We enjoyed all the dishes we had.,Date of visit: July 2020,Dragon Pearl Chinese Restaurant,1,"Paignton, United Kingdom"
Good old fashioned fun,Nice to go on a pier where you are not charged or inundated with crap. Lots of flashing lights and electronic ways to spend your money.,Date of experience: July 2020,Paignton Pier,1,"Paignton, United Kingdom"
So good we went twice,"Definitely a lucky find we all enjoyed everything thing we ordered. Great pizzas, burgers and the beer I had was fantastic. All staff we encountered were welcoming, friendly and helpful. We even went back the next day for breakfast which was also really good. Great view from inside the building.",Date of visit: July 2020,Shoreline,1,"Paignton, United Kingdom"
Nice Pint,Called in for a cheeky pint which was only £3 so had a couple. Pub is not very salubrious but it has something about it. We didn't eat but the food others had did look good.,Date of visit: July 2020,The Horse and Groom,1,"Ivybridge, United Kingdom"
Friendly Welcome,Even as a walk in during the time of covid we were afforded a fantastic welcome. We had only called in for a drink but also ended up ordering food off takeaway menu (which was excellent and cheap). We enjoyed the beer garden though it was in shade when we were there in the early evening. Only downside was the lack of the choice of draught beers though to be fair it was very well kept and the reason for this is how quiet the pub is due to the current times.,Date of visit: July 2020,Anchor Inn,1,"Ugborough, United Kingdom"
Wow,"Only visited this hotel to have a cream tea. Simply stunning. We walked both ways as low tide and all around the island so got to see the hotel from all angles. We enjoyed everything both in and out of the hotel. Now saving up for a return visit, staying next time.",Date of stay: July 2020,Burgh Island Hotel,1,"Burgh Island, United Kingdom"
Fantastic walking,Some steep up and downs but well worth the effort to be able to visit little coves and spend time enjoying the views.,Date of experience: July 2020,South West Coast Path - Burgh Island,1,"Bigbury-on-Sea, United Kingdom"
Quick Pint,Had a quick pint at the end of a visit to Burgh Island? Nice beer on a fantastic island. Came in a plastic glass so even got a souvenir.,Date of visit: July 2020,The Pilchard Inn,1,"Bigbury-on-Sea, United Kingdom"
Nice beach,Good looking beach a short walk from Bigbury. Nice looking cafe bar overlooking beach some parking which is much cheaper than Bigburys pay and display.,Date of experience: July 2020,Challaborough Beach,1,"Bigbury-on-Sea, United Kingdom"
Might just have found my new favourite beach,Wow we seriously loved this beach only came the Bigbury as we had booked for a cream tea on Burgh Island on a day the weather was due to be cloudy. However the sun shone so we spent a day on the beach. Lots going on but even on a busy day lots of space. No doubt this would have changed if the tide was in.,Date of experience: July 2020,Bigbury-on-Sea Beach,1,"Bigbury-on-Sea, United Kingdom"
First Visit,"Went with friends in the pre Covid 19 days. The place was suprisingly busy (and remained so) despite us just missing the happy hour. The cocktails we had were mostly excellent, mixed from memory and done the proper way with staff even scorching orange peel as part of a Negroni. We had a few drinks leading to headaches the next day. One round was a little inconsistent but this was corrected. The prices initially seemed higher than average but were worth it.",Date of experience: March 2020,Monk Bar,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Good place to people watch,"Enjoyed a couple of beers on Sunday waiting for friends to finish a film. Decent beer, friendly staff, pleasant atmosphere and great place to people watch. Enjoyed watching a young lad on a computer accessing the free wifi have a nice drink of tap water whilst eating a pack up.",Date of visit: March 2020,Showroom Cinema Bar,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Still the best micro pub,"Whenever we are down Ecclesall Road we end up in here. Always great beers, always seen nothing but friendly helpful bar staff and the customers tend to be more sensible than in other nearby bars. Roll on the summer and sitting outside again.",Date of experience: March 2020,The Beer House,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Best Beef I have ever eaten,"Suprised we could walk in though I think covid19 had a role to play in that. First time visit for all us. We all really enjoyed our meal and as I said the beef on the Sunday lunch was fantastic. I would have scored it 5 if the food had been warmer on the plate. Friendly professional staff, good drinks you cannot ask for much more.",Date of visit: March 2020,Silversmiths Restaurant,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Not sure what I had but,"Cannot remember what I had due to a crap memory not alcohol I hasten to add. We all really enjoyed the food we ordered, all served in a buzzing atmosphere (not the usual Indian Restaurant Saturday night vibe). Drinks good, staff friendly and we didn't think it was that expensive.",Date of visit: March 2020,Mowgli Street Food,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
I thought pubs were struggling,Met here on the way to the Lantern Theatre thinking it would be quiet. Got that wrong really buzzing with lots of mixed age groups mostly eating. Good range of drinks on offer.,Date of visit: March 2020,The Stag's Head,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Fantastic food but so noisy,Four of us ate and had a fantastic meal. We enjoyed four different starters and mains and everyone finished theirs. Even tried a cocktail which was good. Only drawback was the reverberations from a couple of the Saturday groups who were already there when we arrived.,Date of visit: March 2020,Urban Choola,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Typically Spoons,Spent a happy couple of hours in here. Arrived during the post work rush and took a look round to find a seat. Ordered via app and settled down to wait but order was delivered within two minutes. Ate a meal and more drinks all delivered equally quickly by friendly staff. Only downside is around the seats upstairs some of the panelling needs looking at.,Date of visit: February 2020,The Seven Stars,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
First time today,First visit today all enjoyed the variety of foods all freshly prepared and served quicker than expected. Luckily we went during a lull so not too busy. Despite the quietness it was still noisy only downside for us.,Date of visit: February 2020,Kommune,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
It gets worse,As a former resident of York we walked up here (not something I did when I lived here) to look at the new shop of a mutal friend. Disappointed is the word that springs to mind (and is also appropriate language for this forum). I might have missed it but not sure why the place seemed full of Harry Potter shops. Nothing personal against teenage wizards but I don't want to see ranges of goods being sold in a place with no discernible link to the movie franchise. When the pointless shoos then bring in hoards of visitors to look at them caus6to already busy thoroughfare to be even busier is a reason I will avoid the Shambles again.,Date of experience: January 2020,Shambles,1,"York, United Kingdom"
Loved it,As a former resident of York I was devastated to visit this place. Why wasn't it open when I was a resident? Only called in for a cheeky beer upstairs in the beer hall but really enjoyed the experience. Looking forward to a deeper investigation of the beers.,Date of visit: January 2020,Brew York,1,"York, United Kingdom"
Nearly excellent,Came her with friewho have eaten at the sister restaurant many times but wanted to try here. The staff were welcoming but due to the newness of the venue the staff did not seem fully up to speed with the routines. The food got off to a good start with really good masala dosa. The mains were what we ordered but I was not a fan of the chicken curry in fact I wished I had ordered another dosa. We all felt we would come again when the staff are fully embedded but they do need to improve this area. Also the toilets were bloody freezing.,Date of visit: January 2020,Kalpakavadi,1,"York, United Kingdom"
First time for us,Taken in by friends for pre dinner cocktails it did seem quiet which meant we got served quickly. We had cocktails made by the very friendly staff and we even sat in a window seat which made it all the better. Two of the party returned on Sunday for coffees but left due to the length of wait.,Date of visit: January 2020,The Fossgate Social,1,"York, United Kingdom"
Always good to return,Post shopping drinks when in York are always a must and this is our venue of choice. Great place to meet up with friends. Drinks are premium in both quality and cost. Mens toilets less so but it somehow adds to the charm.,Date of experience: January 2020,Vahe Bar,1,"York, United Kingdom"
The Beacon not out of town site,"Comfy chairs, excellent screen and sound quality. It is expensive but not overcrowded and the staff I have experienced over three visits have all seemed keen, helpful and enthusiastic. Downside no bar, lots of escalators and walking past empty units and a touch on the expensive side. Also new Star Wars film was crap but I cannot really blame the cinema for that.",Date of experience: December 2019,Cineworld Eastbourne,1,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom"
"Faceless, soulless, typical shopping experience",I am not a keen shopper but this place doesn't help. Yes you can walk between shops without getting wet but it is a typical uk identikit shopping centre. Usual shops like the cinema though.,Date of experience: December 2019,The Beacon,1,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom"
Typically Wetherspoons but upgrade required,Arrived to usual dinnertime rush in Spoons. Ordered via app and we were happy to be served both drinks and food quickly by a friendly member of staff. Everything food and drink wise was exactly what you would expect. Only downside is tables need clearing quicker and they definitely need to be introduced to a damp cloth.,Date of visit: December 2019,The London and County,1,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom"
Another visit vegan in the family is very happy again,Once again this was the choice for a family meal. As always food was good and they have a really good vegan selection of meals.,Date of visit: December 2019,Pomodoro e Mozzarella,1,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom"
Top Hotel,"Looks good, feels good. We all enjoyed our stay in this very comfy hotel. Having the cocktail bar was a bonus that saved a very wet walk for our aperatifs. Everything you expect in a hotel though a fridge would have been nice. Excellent breakfast as well.",Date of stay: November 2019,Dakota Leeds,1,"Leeds, United Kingdom"
Sorry Dave,"Having twice walked into Dave's party we found the main bar area. Great cocktails, cool dancing staff and music that had the entire venue moving. Would definitely call again when in Leeds.",Date of experience: November 2019,The Maven,1,"Leeds, United Kingdom"
Great venue,After queuing to get in during which some of the group were agitating to leave we got in via the friendly door staff. Good venue mixing live and recorded music. Bar prices suprisingly good.,Date of experience: November 2019,The Domino Club,1,"Leeds, United Kingdom"
Cocktail o'clock,Group of four who were all staying in the hotel. We enjoyed the cocktails but not the fact we only got a table when people had left and the table reservation system seemed to have ended.,Date of visit: November 2019,Dakota Grill,1,"Leeds, United Kingdom"
Yes it is on the pricy side but....,"Really good meal, interesting, varied, delicious. We shared two different set menus and across all the 'waves' we only had one dish one of the group wasn't sure about. Only scored in a four due to the length of wait for our booked table to be cleared.",Date of visit: November 2019,Tattu Leeds,1,"Leeds, United Kingdom"
Pleasant surprise,We have lived in Sheffield for eight years and have driven past hundreds of times and never called in even when we are using the COOP or the laundrette. We only booked for tonight because our usual restaurants were fully booked. However we all fully enjoyed our meals and left satisfied. We will give it another go in the near future. PS really nice staff.,Date of visit: October 2019,Bistrot Pierre,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Yes it is a Wetherspoon's but...,Walked into to see a queue at the bar but as I sat down ready to use the app the three staff behind the bar cleared the waiting customers. I ordered and was told my breakfast wouldn't be long but with past experience of other Spoons I sat down with a book. However my meal arrived promptly and I was served by a really friendly lady. Yes the pub is full of old people though this is Brid but this spoons seems a good one.,Date of visit: September 2019,Prior John,1,"Bridlington, United Kingdom"
I always wondered why,As a child on our annual trip to Flamborough this was the only beach we didn't visit. Though the lifeboat station is now her I did find it the most disappointing of the bays. Plus side a deer did run across the road right in front of me.,Date of experience: September 2019,South Landing Local Nature Reserve,1,"Flamborough, United Kingdom"
Disappointing,Big venue with lots of space but no real soul. Beer most expensive I encountered in Flamborough. I only realised of the links to Haven when I started to link to the wifi.,Date of visit: September 2019,Headlands Family Restaurant and Cafe Bar,1,"Flamborough, United Kingdom"
Beautiful,This never used to be favourite area but now it is. Stunning location. I never actually got in to the lighthouse but don't feel I missed anything though I have been up it in the past.,Date of experience: September 2019,Flamborough Lighthouse,1,"Flamborough, United Kingdom"
Still lovely but.....,"Revisiting after 30 years, still beautiful but the cliffs seem a lot smaller than they used to be. Peaceful, not busy and free parking say no more.",Date of experience: September 2019,Thornwick Bay,1,"Flamborough, United Kingdom"
Fish and chips,"Not sure why I went for fish and chips because I don't really enjoy them normally. Only called in because as a kid we were brought here for curry sauce and chips about 40 years ago on our annual holidays. However they were fantastic, the fish was delicious for the first time ever I ate all the fish and through some batter away. Curry sauce still on the chips. Would highly recommend this location though they should warn about the size of the fish as it was massive and cooled right in front of me.",Date of visit: September 2019,High Street Fisheries,1,"Flamborough, United Kingdom"
Popped in once,Not really fair to judge somewhere on one short visit but for me the choice of beer was limited and it was very quiet.,Date of visit: September 2019,Royal Dog and Duck,1,"Flamborough, United Kingdom"
Favourite pub in the village,Called in three times over the week. Friendly greetings everytime and enjoyed some well kept beer. Didn't manage to eat though.,Date of visit: September 2019,The Ship Inn,1,"Sewerby, United Kingdom"
Not changed that much,"Walked here via Thornwick Bay, enjoyed revisiting my childhood memories. Real shame the life boat has gone and no boats going out due to the wind direction. Still stunning.",Date of experience: September 2019,North Landing Beach,1,"Flamborough, United Kingdom"
Cheeky pint only,Went in mid week for a drink friendly enough staff and locals. Didn't eat but had already heard food is good from others. Not inspired to go back and try.,Date of visit: September 2019,Rose & Crown Public House,1,"Flamborough, United Kingdom"
Suprisingly enjoyable,"With 8 of us looking to dine in Soho on a Saturday evening with nothing booked I wasn't hopeful and when I found that we could get a table in Byron's I wasn't happy. However I was wrong, the bugers we had were excellent with the vegan in our party stating the burger was the best vegan burger she has ever had. We enjoyed the beers on offer and we had a fantastic waitress, I don't remember her name but she was Polish. All in all we would recommend this place, especially if you have a window seat for the people watching. Only criticism is you need to touch up the paintwork around the windows.",Date of visit: August 2019,Byron Beak Street,1,"London, United Kingdom"
"Great location, fantastic staff","Family stay, from the moment of arrival nothing seemed too much trouble. Friendly greetings, excellent service in all areas of the hotel. We all enjoyed the outdoor bar, the excellent buffet breakfast and the comfy beds. Some of our party also enjoyed the gym.",Date of stay: August 2019,"St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel",1,"London, United Kingdom"
Vibrant,Always enjoy a mooch around Covent Garden. We had eaten in Balthazar are went for a people watch. Lots of post work drinkers out and the bars and restaurants were busy. Typical of Britain most other things were shut which limited our options of activities.,Date of experience: August 2019,Covent Garden,1,"London, United Kingdom"
And this is the middle of London?,Spent an hour on the water on a hot afternoon. Busy but well organised so the longest part of boarding was listening to the list of rules. We had a mixture of pedalos and rowing boats to move around the water inbetween the different birds. Pedalos are hardwork!!!,Date of experience: August 2019,Serpentine Boating Lake,1,"London, United Kingdom"
To be fair I didn't even see the bill,"Really enjoyed our visit on a Friday night, busy, vibrant but nothing that distracted from the meal. We were all on the £55 set menu which gave everyone a good choice of meals. Even the vegan amongst us had a choice of two different dishes on 2 of the 3 courses.
Bonus points for the quality of the food, the attentive service and the ambience.
Negative point the initial waiting staff telling everyone that they didn't do tap water so we tended up with bottled water a £4 per go. However considering we were sat by the sink where they filled bottles with tap water this was questioned and the money was knocked off the bill.
Gave the experience a 5 because of the plus points and someone else kindly paid most of the bill. Probably also because of the amount of alcohol I consumed.",Date of visit: August 2019,Balthazar,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Pleasantly surprised,"Having visited several Zizzis over the years I was not that impressed when my friends chose to eat here. It was heaving outside as tramlines was in full swing. We were offered a table but when he asked for a different one this was no trouble. All the staff we dealt with were efficient, friendly and helpful. The food we had was really enjoyed by all, with the only complaint from me is the enjoyable experience let to choosing another bottle of wine and this mornings headache.",Date of visit: July 2019,Zizzi - Sheffield Leopold Square,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Certainly full (me not the pub),After two weeks in Cornwall we finally got around to trying the Oyster Catcher. I would class it as typical pub fare but with more emphasis on fish. We have had everything we tried elsewhere usually tastier but also more expensive. We would go again but next time only for starters which are big. Staff well worth a mention for their attentiveness. Car parking not an issue well signed and the staff make sure that if you have paid you get the total money off your bill. Glad we left when we did (just gone 10pm) because the younger party people were starting to appear.,Date of visit: July 2019,The Oystercatcher,1,"Polzeath, United Kingdom"
Stunning,Went to an evening performance of Verdi's Macbeth with three teenagers (who have studied Macbeth for their GCSE'S and were less than delighted to be seeing it again) and myself attending our first opera. All concerns were assuaged by the setting simply stunning. Even when concentration was lacking we watched the boats going past on the changing light. Things you need for a show seats with backs hired at £1 and well worth it and if like me you enjoy a glass of something and don't want to watch the people in front enjoy a bottle of wine take your own the theatre doesn't sell any.,Date of experience: July 2019,Minack Theatre,1,"Penzance, United Kingdom"
Where did this place come from,Yet another stunning Cornish beach somewhat spoiled by the vagaries of bars etc closing in the late afternoon and other venues not catering for the groups of people who don't want a full meal.,Date of experience: July 2019,Sennen Cove Beach,1,"Sennen, United Kingdom"
Never like to see pointless street furniture,Nice clean beach but for me advertising no dogs allowed and then watching most people ignore it seemed silly. Take the signs down if you don't mean it and let everyone and their dogs enjoy it.,Date of experience: July 2019,Porthminster Beach,1,"St Ives, United Kingdom"
Wow that is what I call blue,"Golden sands, leading into a turquoise blue sea with water crystal clear. And I only had to drive here.",Date of experience: July 2019,Gwithian Beach,1,"St Ives, United Kingdom"
Good buts and bad bits,We were not over impressed with much of the art work on display however the cafe with the view over the beach made up for much of that. However the score reflects our thoughts of the art which should be the highlight.,Date of experience: July 2019,Tate St. Ives,1,"St Ives, United Kingdom"
Only a beer,Went into pub for a cream tea after reading sign advertising cream teas to be told 'we don't stock scones'. Bar staff seemed to be struggling with the limited queue at the bar. Saying that decent beer and nice outlook.,Date of visit: July 2019,Old Success Inn,1,"Sennen Cove, United Kingdom"
All enjoyed the meal,"We had seen and fancied eating here the previous day but couldn't book until today. We all enjoyed the food served and despite sharing starters none of us could manage a dessert. Despite this we managed to rack up our biggest meal bill this holiday in Cornwall. Best thing about the experience was the staff, for whom nothing seemed too much trouble. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the service was excellent.",Date of visit: July 2019,The Mote,1,"Port Isaac, United Kingdom"
Who needs to catch anything anyway,Spent a really pleasant four hours bobbing around on the sea. Enjoyed the views of Cornwall almost as much as watching other people catch fish. Lee was really friendly and helpful and tried really hard in an attempt to get everyone to catch a fish. Would go with Lee again when in Padstow.,Date of experience: July 2019,Emma Kate,1,"Padstow, United Kingdom"
Everyone's favourite beach,"Spent time on several beaches but this was everyone's favourite. The sand, the sea, the friendly vines, the ice cream Van's, been able to hire wet suits and paddle boards by the hour are amongst the many reasons we gave this a 5.",Date of experience: July 2019,Polzeath Beach,1,"Newquay, United Kingdom"
Dog central,"This was our local beach so heavily used by us we enjoyed its quiet, unspoilt beauty. Even on sunny weekends it was not packed. Yes there are lots of dogs but we never had a problem with one. Only issues are human problems with people obviously feeling it was ok to leave used bbq's and pizza boxes at the top of the stairs to the car park. C'mon people not acceptable.",Date of experience: July 2019,Daymer Bay Beach,1,"Wadebridge, United Kingdom"
Sunday afternoon stroll,Arrived with two teenagers in tow after a tea room bribe we had a walk around the grounds. Enjoyed seeing the stage set up of Wuthering Heights on one side of the lawn whilst croquet on the other side. The gardens were not the classically sculptured seen in other gardens but were very green and verdant.,Date of experience: July 2019,Pencarrow House and Gardens,1,"Washaway, United Kingdom"
Cheeky beer,Only popped in for lunch but missed service so stopped for a drink instead. Nice pint sat on the small sunny terrace overlooking the harbour.,Date of visit: July 2019,The Golden Lion,1,"Port Isaac, United Kingdom"
Enjoyable,"Whilst we all enjoyed our visit, or meals and the beer we all felt the place was let down by the slow service. The staff working were friendly, helpful and hardworking but everything still took too long. Shame.",Date of visit: July 2019,The Waterfront Cafe Bar,1,"Polzeath, United Kingdom"
Cheeky extra meal,After a short wall we ended up here as they offered vegan options. We had a mixture of different meals enjoying them all. Enjoyed the setting on a cloudy Cornish afternoon. The staff welcome made it sunny inside.,Date of visit: June 2019,TJ's Surf Shop and Cafe,1,"Polzeath, United Kingdom"
Proper theatre,Yes when you sit down your knees are pressed against the seat in front and when you move either way you clash elbows with the person next to you and yes the interval drinks are expensive and you you have to queue up to order and then stand up to drink. However when this is offset by the quality of the show (we saw The Book of Mormon) all is forgiven. Fantastic lines of sight and absolute quality of performance. Highly recommended.,Date of experience: June 2019,Palace Theatre,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Pre theatre with a different slant,After wondering around Manchester looking for a pre theatre bite to eat in the rain found this place. Didn't seem much initially but good burrito and cold beers made it a different to the usual pre theatre experience. We would go again next time in town as burritos good and easy to find a seat.,Date of visit: June 2019,Listo Burrito,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Definitely an Ego place you can tell by the menu,"First time at this branch though regular visitors to other sites. First of all a positive mention to all the staff who were all welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable for this only I would have given a 5. The restaurant itself caused mixed reviews amongst our party. We ranged from missing the openness of the city centre restaurant through to quite liking the more closed off feeling. Thre reason I gave a 4 was not about the food which was all well cooked and presented but the choice of meals. We had simply seen it all before, one of our party had exactly the same meal for the fourth time running (though he didn't seem to mind), others in the party found it a little repetitive.",Date of visit: June 2019,"Ego at The Dore Moor Inn, Sheffield",1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Local Museum,"Comments ranged from it was interesting, there is more to look at than you think and my favourite it is full of old stuff. First visit in 25 years of annual visits to Seaford. It might be as long again unless it happens to be open on a very rainy day.",Date of experience: April 2019,Seaford Museum,1,"Seaford, United Kingdom"
Early season visit,"Even so early in the season we all really enjoy a visit to the beach in Seaford. Seaford Head and one end and Newhaven at the other so always something you are walking towards. Plus regular break points, sailing club is my favourite but we only visited the one by the Martello Tower this time.",Date of experience: April 2019,Seaford Beach,1,"Seaford, United Kingdom"
Worth a visit,"Positives great cafe with great views over the tennis courts, really good shop, friendly knowledgeable staff/volunteers and it is free.
Downsides we found some of the exhibitions difficult to get on with ranging from too many in a gallery, others were too eclectic in their content. I think we are too used to the space of the Yorkshire Sculpture Park though.",Date of experience: April 2019,Towner Art Gallery,1,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom"
Proper Theatre,Went to see A Song at Twilight which we all really enjoyed. Booked fairly late but still got good seats. Enjoyed the venue and the bar during the interval which offered good quick service without the need to book drinks in advance.,Date of experience: April 2019,Devonshire Park Theatre,1,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom"
Typically Spoons,"As usual you know what you are getting from a Spoons popped in for a quick breakfast and a cheeky pint. Beer was good, cheap and a Northern brew and was delivered via the app. Only drawback was my food took an hour to deliver and had to be chased up via phone and a chat to the manager. Not lazy but sat outside with my dog. Quickly resolved following this though.",Date of visit: April 2019,Cornfield Garage,1,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom"
Dramatic,"Wonderful place to be. Windswept, wild and beautiful. Best thing about it are the outstanding views, though we had to be quick to dive in between the many large school groups in the area.",Date of experience: April 2019,Beachy Head,1,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom"
Fantastic walking,My wife always insists we visit Birling Gap whenever we are in Eastbourne. Brought up in the area she likes to return to visit childhood haunts and she the ever moving cliff edge. Good NT cafe etc here in the car park.,Date of experience: April 2019,Birling Gap and the Seven Sisters,1,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom"
Lucky it is only March,"Group of 7 who could walk in and get a table. Luckily out of school holidays and in March. Good to be able to bring the dog in as well. Very efficient staff and quick service. Most of food excellent but the pancake dishes minimal for the cost. Also the entire place is very noisy. We have been here several times over the years as part of our annual trip to Eastbourne but just didn't quite enjoy it as much as usual. Saying that the Beach Deck is still the favourite for our children, though they are not the ones paying.",Date of visit: April 2019,The Beach Deck,1,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom"
Another Visit,Always seem to endure here for a meal whenin Eastbourne. Once again we ate well even when choosing from the excellent value for money set menu restaurant was busy but staff friendly as always. One of our party is a vegan and she found several choices and also really enjoyed her food as well,Date of visit: March 2019,Pomodoro e Mozzarella,1,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom"
Nice enough dog walk but,"Only reason to visit during March seems to be the walk. Walkers consist of young families, older couples and dog walkers. Unfortunately only two of those groups can go in the cafe. Walk round the lake was a very easy 30 minutes, thought about going round again but didn't seem any point.",Date of experience: March 2019,Pugneys Country Park,1,"Wakefield, United Kingdom"
Still the family favourite,"We have accessed the woods on average twice per week for the last eight years. We have gone from building dens in the woods, to dog walks, to angst ridden teenage breaks from exam revision. Still the only place the kids want to come with us for an unenforced walk. Current favourite activity whilst the dog chases squirrels is looking at the old trees that have fallen over the winter. Looking forward to the bluebells coming out again soon, it looks like it will be a good year.",Date of experience: March 2019,Ecclesall Woods,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Good place for people and dogs,We had brunch as it was a Saturday. We both enjoyed the meals we had. Menu not extensive but we were able to choose and on the plus side my wife was able to order quickly. Also they are dog friendly downstairs and outside.,Date of visit: March 2019,South Street Kitchen,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Took the risk and it paid off,Silent time walking around looking at pre theatre menus before choosing to eat in Thespians. We both really enjoyed the food we had especially with the 10% discount offered if you show your theatre ticket. The staff were really friendly.,Date of visit: March 2019,Thespians,1,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom"
Worth the journey,We went to see Taming of the Shrew which was done fantastically well. We both enjoyed the spectacle if not the themes within the story. Highlight was the g&t during the interval sat on a comfy sofa in the bar. The theatre is fantastic great lines of site we were in the upper circle but still felt close to the action.,Date of experience: March 2019,Royal Shakespeare Theatre,1,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom"
Wow,First visit tonight with our vegan daughter. I really appreciated the fact checked we were ordering vegan. However when I ate my burger I was simply confused by the fantastic tasts and textures. I am a confirmed meat eater but I can honestly say it was the best burger I have ever eaten. Sides of chips were also great. Cracking pint of beer and tap self service tap water on the bar. We will have to visit again.,Date of visit: March 2019,Make No Bones,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
"Surprising, first appearances can be deceptive","We had a expected a more rural setting but once we were inside improved. Considering it was 6 the pub was full which is a good sign with most of the tables pre booked. We managed to access a table that was booked from 7.15. The food ordered arrived quickly and was good, the burgers ordered looked simple but were very tasty (shame condiments in sachets). The food was a good price.

Recommended by a friend,"What can I say the food was lovely, the g&t have my wife gin knees and the sun was shining though this simply provided the extra bonus to make it a 5.",Date of visit: October 2018,Lil's Bar and Bistro,1,"York, United Kingdom"
Lucky Find,Only walked into here for lunch after our original destination lunch was closed. We received a really friendly welcome from the lovely member of staff. We ordered from the menu but as usual we over did it. Everything we ordered was really good and really reminded us of our recent Greek holiday except for it was better and cheaper than in Greece. We were provided with a doggy bag and our son then enjoyed our left overs for his lunch. I hope this place does well and it succeeds in the long term.,Date of visit: October 2018,The Greek Village,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Unexpected,Despite living in Sheffield for 7 years I had never heard of this place. Quite pleased to realise there is more than one David Mellor. We enjoyed the cafe the salads we had were fantastic and it explained why it was so busy. Enjoyed the exhibition space especially the street scene outside who knew that so many things we see everyday were designed by one person. Shop offered things you don't see that often so worth a pop in. Workshop only open at specific times at weekends which didn't bother us as we didn't know it even existed until today.,Date of experience: October 2018,David Mellor Design,1,"Hathersage, United Kingdom"
Would love to say a nice treat after doing the Endcliffe park run,But I can't so it was just a nice treat. We all enjoyed our breakfasts with the only downside the extractor fan and the radio competing for attention. Otherwise a would have given full marks.,Date of visit: October 2018,Brocco Kitchen,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Impressed following first time eating here,"We had visited before but only for drinks as they were fully booked. We learnt a lesson and booked this time for a one hour slot for Sunday lunch. I had probably the best carvery meal I have had, the beef was really good and I was even asked if I had enough and was then given more. The rest of the choices were good as well. Had a pint of well kept Farmers Blonde plus other drinks all for about £10 per head. Friendly staff, who greeted and said goodbye to all customers with the same gusto. We will return though we might have to do it when we are really hungry to do it justice.
Also dog friendly pub, don't forget it is cash only.",Date of visit: September 2018,Sportsman Lodge Moor,1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
In the middle,"In the middle relates to its location between Huddersfield and Sheffield not to anything else. We had a family catch up and chose this pub. We made a good choice, we all had different main courses and all enjoyed everything, plus good beer and very convivial owners who made us all plus dog feel very welcome.
I really recommend this pub and we will come back, next time hopefully with more family members.
Thank for the welcome, the humour, the food and the beer.",Date of visit: September 2018,The Green Dragon Inn,1,"Thurgoland, United Kingdom"
Hmmmmmm,"Spent 49 euros at 7 each to visit arrived at 10.30 waited 5 minutes to get on boat, 8 minute trip, no one really inspired, water not that blue and out again all done in total of 30 mins (including time for coffee) from arriving in the car park. The ubiquitous gift shop was good and the cafe staff were friendly and helpful with beach tips otherwise not sure about the hype.",Date of experience: August 2018,Melissani Cave,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Walked in to a lovely surprise,"First time in Skala and happened to choose hear for our meal. We all chose differently from the good menu and everyone had a good meal. The staff were friendly and very efficient as the restaurant rapidly filled up. Not only was the food good, the house wine was good, the beer was icy cold we also received our cheapest bill for this week. We recommend this place.",Date of visit: August 2018,Mi Abeli,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Nice beach,"Mistake we made was to take an elderly relative. Steep paths/steps at access points, though we did find you can get the car to closer distance for pick ups/drop offs etc. Soft sand, the sea was gorgeous and lots of little fish that nibble at your legs. Good beach bar if you like your pumping sounds. We avoided the extreme sports end of the beach.",Date of experience: August 2018,Makris Gialos Beach,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Not bad,We ate early so restaurant was quite. We ordered a mixture of Italian and Greek dishes. Everyone not having a pizza enjoyed their meal and finished it everyone having pizza left one due to the size not the quality. Staff friendly but no atmosphere early in the evening. Close to the port for a quick look round.,Date of visit: August 2018,La Gondola,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lucky Mistake,The first part of our group made a mistake and entered the wrong restaurant to where we were meant to be meeting. However we we really glad. We all really enjoyed our meals and the local rose at 10 euros a litre went down very well. We voted this as out favourite restaurant of our holiday and despite having choices returned more than once.,Date of visit: August 2018,Avithos Preview Taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best cafe we found on Kefalonia,Following walk around cafe we stopped here for a quick drink. The staff a super friendly.

We keep fonding better places to eat than the previous night.,"Family of seven who all ate well. We had dips and bread with sides of calamari and greek salad for starters all really good. We had several different main courses with two of us choosing the mixed grill (see below). The adults had the house rose which after the initial Blue Steel inducing sip was very quaffable. Finished with shared desserts of a orange and a walnut cake, both massive both delicious. Both cakes finished despite 7 people profesing they were to full to eat. Big mention to the staff all really friendly and welcoming.",Date of visit: August 2018,To Enetiko,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Lovely beach lucky find,"Just drove up the coast looking for an easy to access beach when we happened on this beach. We were able to access this beach with a deeply member of the family with ease.

Nice place to watch the world go by.,"First place we have been in Kefalonia where said we would like to spend a period of time.

Sneaky drink without kids,"Had a crafty hour in the bar, very quiet I had a couple of decent cocktails at 5 euro's each during the 4 hour happy hour (6-10). The range of cocktails was very impressive and with more time would have had a fuller investigation. I think we missed the best time to be there. George (we think) said goodnight but he looked to be settling down with a few cronies to watch the football. I would have spent more time but we had to get back.",Date of visit: August 2018,Crazy George Bar,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Nice beach,"First beach we have visited on Kefalonia, nice sand but personally I found there was just too many sun loungers taking up the area saying that it did mean we could find 4 to rent at a cost of 20 euros for the day. Beach bar was a real bonus but we find the drinks expensive, though this was countered by the cheaper than usual snacks. The sea was lovely and warm, whist the water is fairly shallow it still gets the odd bigger wave to keep you on your toes. Fantastic to see the low key turtle protection scheme in action on the beach though it was concerning that the coverage of the beach by loungers may have a big impact on potential nesting sites.",Date of experience: August 2018,Avithos Beach,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
The bridge to no where,Lovely walk over the water providing a new perspective of the harbour. We walked from town crossed the bridge found the car park and came back.

Lovely Beach,Spent an afternoon on the beach frolicing in the quite big waves. Lots of wipeouts all around. We even enjoyed the waves coming up the beach and flowing under the sun beds. Had lunch on the beach bar which was good and so much cheaper than the beach in the next bay.,Date of experience: August 2018,Ai Helis Beach,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Favourite bar,We had two visits to the beach and two visits here. Better prices than the beach over the headland.

Good apres skiing,Spent the evening watching the football and enjoying the IPA on draft. Good experience to watch the football with good screens.

Not sure why this is number 1 thing to do,As the name suggests this place is a slope in Tankerton. Yes there is a cafe and yes lots of people go but for me I am not sure why.

Love the beach,"Sandy beach, amazing sea pool though didn't use it in April. The beach is even better on a hot day but dogs are not allowed then (1st. May to 30th September). Rides, snacks, sand, sea, pool, and overlooking a harbour. Best thing is when the tide goes out and the fish that get trapped in the pool make their escape by jumping.",Date of experience: April 2018,Margate Main Sands,1,"Margate, United Kingdom"

Mixed age group visit,"From the greeter at to top of the road to the entrance (young lad with seemingly endless energy, who danced and welcomed people even when no one was near him.

So worth the wait,"Our food was very slow but as the rest of the world had descended on the place we were not surprised. The staff were very attentive and even gave us a round of drinks. We had a mixture of the fantastic salads, ploughman's, breakfast and a burger and we all thouroughly enjoyed our meals. The long wait and the initial omission of the chicken from the chicken Caesar salad could all be overlooked because of the fantastic staff and the lovely food. Our only regret was we were with local friends who had plans for us so we could not stop to see the house etc.",Date of visit: April 2018,Quex Barn,1,"Birchington, United Kingdom"
Never felt so old,Could not believe how busy this place was on a Bank Holiday Monday and how young most of the other customers seemed to me. Didn't eat but those doing so around us seemed to be enjoying the usual fare from Spoons. Beer a bit cold and fizzy for me (yes I was drinking proper beer) but as a northerner my standards are higher.,Date of visit: April 2018,Cornfield Garage,1,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom"
The rain wasn't the fault of the pier but...,I had the misfortune of following my kids onto the pier on a rainy bank holiday Monday. It was horrible weather wise which had seen most of the rides closed. When the log flume shuts because of rain it must be wet. Everyone in the world gathered in the arcade which saw the temperature and noise levels rise significantly as money was lost by the bucketful. I ended up going back into the pouring rain as it was the worse of two options. The pity is I have been to the pier many times and it is usually a good place to spend time.,Date of experience: April 2018,Brighton Palace Pier,1,"Brighton, United Kingdom"

Breakfast,"Brought from Eastbourne to Seafood to have breakfast here. I had looked at previous reviews and I was really looking forward to sampling the pancakes and bacon.

Highly recommended but you will need to book to avoid any disappointment.",Date of visit: March 2018,The Grumpy Chef,1,"Seaford, United Kingdom"
Breakfast in bed,"We enjoyed staying here, everything you would want when staying with children namely big TV screens and decent WiFi. Laying in bed writing this and if I stretched I could almost cook breakfast. Everything is very clean and almost everything you would expect is here. Not sure why the room with four beds only has 3 chairs though. Only downside are when you sit up in bed and lean against the wall the bed slides and the emergency lighting is incredibly bright for those sleeping in that part of the apartment. We would stop here again. Due to the great location and the fact there is no parking on site there is plenty on the street even over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend.",Date of stay: March 2018,Congress ApartHotel,1,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom"
Usual watering hole when in Eastbourne,"Decent pub when all things are considered (i.e. it is in the south of England). Friendly staff and customers.

Even the kids love this walk,For the last 25 years we have walked from Seaford up and over the Seven Sisters. As years have passed and our family has grown to six and a dog we all still look forward to the walk whatever the time of year. We never get bored and the continual changes due to costal erosion. This walk is as good as anywhere in the world in terms of scenery. Love it.,Date of experience: March 2018,Seven Sisters Country Park,1,"Seaford, United Kingdom"
"Great beach, free parking",Only gave a 4 because I prefer sandy beaches. Seaford beach is pebbles and is quite steep at certain times of the year.

Laying in bed writing this and if I stretched I could almost cook breakfast. Everything is very clean and almost everything you would expect is here. Not sure why the room with four beds only has 3 chairs though. Only downside are when you sit up in bed and lean against the wall the bed slides and the emergency lighting is incredibly bright for those sleeping in that part of the apartment.

Apparently they have moved address which is why they were so quiet,We were dropped here by a local guide to have a meal. Initially we were unsure as no one else was in the restaurant.

Best thing about the visit was the santa display over by the school.",Date of experience: January 2018,St. Philomena's Church,1,"Mysuru (Mysore), India"
Wow,"It is hard to put into words the beauty of this building. The colours, the history (though recent) and the sheer grandeur around every corner. We did have a guide who was able to circumnavigate the bottle necks with the odd back hander, he did a good job and really made it really interesting as we learnt about the history of the Marahajas and the British. This is such a worthwhile way to spend half a day. The gardens and temple are worth a walkway round but none of us liked seeing the elephants chained by the legs posing for photos with paying tourists, they did not look that happy.",Date of experience: January 2018,Mysuru Palace,1,"Mysuru (Mysore), India"
English cinema of yesteryear,"Don't hate me but I took my children to see the new Jumanji film. From the moment we arrived having walked straight past the ticket office/hole in a wall we were picked up by the greeter, taken behind the scenes to buy our tickets where we were also given sweets. We upgraded to the balcony and sat in very comfy, slightly reclining seats. We had to jump up quickly for the Indian national anthem before the film started. The audience were really entertaining as any mild boob or penis reference was met with laughter. Half way through the lights came on, the film stopped and everyone went for snacks, before the film restarted after 5 minutes. We all loved the experience, the film and the other audience members, maybe I am reminiscing about my own youth and I may prefer a 3d multiplex but it is worth trying.",Date of experience: January 2018,Rajkamal Theatre,1,"Mysuru (Mysore), India"
Good hotel in good location,"All staff very friendly and helpful though it would be nice to see the ladies on reception smile more. We enjoyed the breakfasts which included decent DIY masala dosa. We had a couple of faults in our room upon arrival which were rectified when reported. Most sites are walkable from the hotel if you so wish with the palace a good 10 minutes away. Shopping area close by. Downsides are lack of bedside lights in the bedrooms, no outdoor space and a very limited choice of eating establishments in the area. The hotel seems to be rebranding to the Adeline.",Date of stay: January 2018,Hotel KVC International,1,"Mysuru (Mysore), India"
Surprising,We went to the zoo with low expectations but we were really surprised. There are lots of different animals. Highlights included the keeper interaction with the elephants and the hippos who were having a great time in the water. Crowds built up and dispersed very quickly as some very large school groups arrived but the size of the place made this ok. Well with a visit as the entrance cost is 50rps and entertained the entire family for 3 hours.,Date of experience: January 2018,Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens,1,"Mysuru (Mysore), India"
Everything is fine,We all enjoyed the meal but we were disappointed with the lack of southern Indian fare. So while the food was good it was not what we would have picked as our first choice (we were dropped off here on a tour and had limited time). Positives were a couple of cold draft kingfishers and the red light service calling system. However the staff were so attentive this was had needed much to the chagrin of my children.,Date of visit: January 2018,Parklane Hotel Restaurant,1,"Mysuru (Mysore), India"

We were sat in the court yard and not the bar as this was not a problem according to staff. We had a very nice drink and decided to order desserts for five of our party. One of the staff approached us as we were finishing and we were all made to feel uncomfortable about needing to order more, at this point we asked for the bill and left. My children felt the man was rude and could not wait to leave.

OK,No rainy season for two years means the river is really low at the moment. Everyone talks about its fast flowing water but this is not happening at the moment.

Comfortable but 4km from Hampi.,A real oasis near to Hampi. We had a comfortable stay enjoying the excellent breakfast and the pool (the water temperature would be best described as surprisingly refreshing!!!). My favourite feature of the hotel is the room safes which you can lift out of the wardrobe and move to somewhere under a light as there is no lighting near the wardrobe which would make it difficult to use the safe if it was secured. Whilst the museum is across the road everything else is a tuk tuk ride away. Despite any negatives this is the nicest hotel we have stayed in.,Date of stay: January 2018,Clarks Inn Hampi,1,"Hampi, India"
Glad we went but...,Though most of the food was good (especially the veg thali) and it has a good view it did seem to me that everyone was there due to trip advisor/Lonely Planet (just like us). Place was full and the service was good despite the posts of others to the contrary. I would go back but if it was so busy I would choose elsewhere as it did not shine as a restaurant above others in the area.,Date of visit: January 2018,Laughing Buddha,1,"Hampi, India"
Things that make you go oooo.,First place in India that upon our arrival our slightly spoilt teenagers have gone oooo this looks alright. This was helped by the well maintained gardens and the fact the WiFi signal was strong from the gate and they could access it via the password immediately. It would be nice if the rooms were finished to the same high standards as the outside but still comfortable.,Date of stay: December 2017,Carina Beach Resort,1,"Benaulim, India"
All good,"This is one of the restaurants called Mahal the other one has the name Aggie on its sign. We all really enjoyed this place, comfy beds, nice bar area and very attentive staff. Service was good but at times the staff did appear to be ensuring enough money was spent to cover the costs of the free beds. Once this was reached much more relaxed. Typical prices compared to elsewhere on the beach and food was tasty across all meals we had we would come here again.",Date of visit: December 2017,The Mahal,1,"Benaulim, India"
Fantastic,"We visited during the early evening and had a great time. No guide, no booklet and two bunches of bananas to feed the elephant. Top tip the locals seem to go by is go after 6 when it becomes totally free anyway with no camera charges and have 10 rupee notes to pay for a blessing. We are going again tomorrow. It is a shame the temple is painted it looked ok from a distance but up close it clashes with other structures.",Date of experience: January 2018,Virupaksha Temple,1,"Hampi, India"

Interesting history of the building and it's sir conditioned central room.,Date of experience: January 2018,Lotus Mahal,1,"Hampi, India"
Another great visit,We enjoyed hearing about the history of the elephant stables and the homes of their keepers. The elephant stables were interesting and highlighted the ceremonial importance of these animals (though they are no longer kept here). The keepers accommodation was good because it is full of statues of different gods etc. Again the moorish influence was apparent on the architecture.,Date of experience: January 2018,Elephant Stables,1,"Hampi, India"
Yes it is cheesy tourist stuff but.....,Such a pleasure to be so close to this magnificent animal. Felt bad to pay 10 rupee to receive a blessing from an elephant but frankly I don't care and we even went back.,Date of experience: January 2018,Lakshmi the Elephant,1,"Hampi, India"
Worth checking out,"This place is in a hotel so you need to look out for the sign within a sign. Once you are in the canteen style interior you are in for a treat.

Most ordered pizzas whilst I had a paneer dopiaza which was the nicest thing I have had in India.",Date of visit: December 2017,Mango Tree Restaurant,1,"Hampi, India"

Nearly excellent but needs to sort the little things.,"Positives we all slept really well, there is a pool though we never saw it get any sun, the staff are really friendly and helpful.
Negatives there were things in all three of our rooms that were not quite right such as a glass panel in the bathroom in 433 meant if you are stood at the toilet (as a man) you can see on to the corridor and vice versa.
This said I would stop again.",Date of stay: December 2017,OYO 7333 V Palms,1,"Candolim, India"
Fun,We were taken as part of a companies itenerany so me not have picked to go ourselves. However we did enjoy it and despite having some concerns we sampled the different tasting elements and got stuck into the buffet.

Despite any negatives this is the nicest hotel we have stayed in.,Date of stay: January 2018,Clarks Inn Hampi,1,"Hampi, India"
Glad we went but...,Though most of the food was good (especially the veg thali) and it has a good view it did seem to me that everyone was there due to trip advisor/Lonely Planet (just like us). Place was full and the service was good despite the posts of others to the contrary. I would go back but if it was so busy I would choose elsewhere as it did not shine as a restaurant above others in the area.,Date of visit: January 2018,Laughing Buddha,1,"Hampi, India"
Things that make you go oooo.,First place in India that upon our arrival our slightly spoilt teenagers have gone oooo this looks alright. This was helped by the well maintained gardens and the fact the WiFi signal was strong from the gate and they could access it via the password immediately. It would be nice if the rooms were finished to the same high standards as the outside but still comfortable.,Date of stay: December 2017,Carina Beach Resort,1,"Benaulim, India"
All good,"This is one of the restaurants called Mahal the other one has the name Aggie on its sign. We all really enjoyed this place, comfy beds, nice bar area and very attentive staff. Service was good but at times the staff did appear to be ensuring enough money was spent to cover the costs of the free beds. Once this was reached much more relaxed. Typical prices compared to elsewhere on the beach and food was tasty across all meals we had we would come here again.",Date of visit: December 2017,The Mahal,1,"Benaulim, India"
Fantastic,"We visited during the early evening and had a great time. No guide, no booklet and two bunches of bananas to feed the elephant. Top tip the locals seem to go by is go after 6 when it becomes totally free anyway with no camera charges and have 10 rupee notes to pay for a blessing. We are going again tomorrow. It is a shame the temple is painted it looked ok from a distance but up close it clashes with other structures.",Date of experience: January 2018,Virupaksha Temple,1,"Hampi, India"
Beautiful building,Unfortunately you are unable to enter the building as previous visitors have caused so much damage by scratching their initials on the stonework. Interesting history of the building and it's sir conditioned central room.,Date of experience: January 2018,Lotus Mahal,1,"Hampi, India"
Another great visit,We enjoyed hearing about the history of the elephant stables and the homes of their keepers. The elephant stables were interesting and highlighted the ceremonial importance of these animals (though they are no longer kept here). The keepers accommodation was good because it is full of statues of different gods etc. Again the moorish influence was apparent on the architecture.,Date of experience: January 2018,Elephant Stables,1,"Hampi, India"
Yes it is cheesy tourist stuff but.....,Such a pleasure to be so close to this magnificent animal. Felt bad to pay 10 rupee to receive a blessing from an elephant but frankly I don't care and we even went back.,Date of experience: January 2018,Lakshmi the Elephant,1,"Hampi, India"
Worth checking out,"This place is in a hotel so you need to look out for the sign within a sign. Once you are in the canteen style interior you are in for a treat. Friendly, helpful staff who found nothing too much trouble even letting us cancel an item when we over ordered. Most ordered pizzas whilst I had a paneer dopiaza which was the nicest thing I have had in India.",Date of visit: December 2017,Mango Tree Restaurant,1,"Hampi, India"
OK,"Goan prawn curry was ok and service from all staff was friendly and good. Everything was simply ok. Would I go again, probably yes judging by the number of returning customers who seemed to be all around us so we may have ordered badly.",Date of visit: December 2017,Jack's Corner,1,"Benaulim, India"
Nearly excellent but needs to sort the little things.,"Positives we all slept really well, there is a pool though we never saw it get any sun, the staff are really friendly and helpful.
Negatives there were things in all three of our rooms that were not quite right such as a glass panel in the bathroom in 433 meant if you are stood at the toilet (as a man) you can see on to the corridor and vice versa.
This said I would stop again.",Date of stay: December 2017,OYO 7333 V Palms,1,"Candolim, India"
Fun,We were taken as part of a companies itenerany so me not have picked to go ourselves. However we did enjoy it and despite having some concerns we sampled the different tasting elements and got stuck into the buffet. Really nice to see lots of different nationalities including Indians all experiencing the setting. It was done well and it is not a big oversell of spices. Even the drinks that were not included in the buffet were priced normally.,Date of experience: December 2017,Tropical Spice Plantation,1,"Ponda, India"
Happy to find this place,"After a long delay on the sleeper from Mumbai, a taxi no show we arrived in Candolim ready for a meal. We all chose something different and all tried each others. Only thing we were not that bothered about was the spring rolls. If we were in town longer we would go again. Also the service was excellent.",Date of visit: December 2017,Lezeros Restaurant and Bar,1,"Candolim, India"
Fur Coat and no Knickers,Approaching the building in the evening wow. We all stopped to take pictures (I think the locals realised we were tourists at this point. However once inside you are back in the real Mumbai with the noise and the hustle and bustle. We all enjoyed the experience and it reminded us of how the train was late and a person with mental health issues started shouting at me. Just like home.,Date of experience: December 2017,Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus,1,"Mumbai, India"
Surrounded by music,"Sat here lovely evening, bar the differing music from the bars either side. Had a basic beer and a burger tonight already tired of spice. Nice place, the staff were really friendly.",Date of visit: December 2017,Claudina's Shack,1,"Candolim, India"
My favourite place in Mumbai,"We all loved the walk along the promenade, the street food stalls had fantastic masala dosa and soft drinks fed 6 and were amazed at the bill. Then we rounded it off by meeting Santa on the beach.",Date of experience: December 2017,Chowpatty Beach,1,"Mumbai, India"
So embarrassed to be here,"On a family holiday to Mumbai and due to absolute pester power for the children ended up in here. That said cheaper than UK, staff were really friendly and helpful. Food up to usual standards as well. Only concern was the suddenly above the usual percentage of white faces for Mumbai.",Date of visit: December 2017,Pizza Express,1,"Mumbai, India"
Long walk,Nice flat walk though the weather was fantastic it was a bit boring after a while. Lots of people about but unless you like people watching that was it.,Date of experience: December 2017,Marine Drive,1,"Mumbai, India"
As good as expected,"Very clean, we had excellent showers in all rooms and helpful friendly staff. I really enjoyed the breakfast served in our rooms but others struggled with the spicing. I would recommend this place to other users.",Date of stay: December 2017,Hotel Royal Castle,1,"Mumbai, India"
