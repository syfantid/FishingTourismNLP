Special Lunch/Dinner Place,Amazing view best on the island. Fancy food for special lunch or Dinner date. You don't get the normal greek kitchen here it IS much more special with high quality. There is also a bar to have only a drink instead of having food.,Date of visit: September 2019,Rachi,1,"Lefkada, Greece"
Small and sweet,This beach ist super small füll with umbrellas and chairs you can rent.street to the beach is good but narrow. There are many parking spaces for 5€ the whole day.there is a small bar where you can have a drink or some snacks and food.we only went there for parking and then took the stairs down to the beach to the left side away from the rental umbrellas. You go through the rocks Like 5min and then you arrive at the wonderful Sandy beach megali petra.best beach on lefkada so far. We went there at 11am. You should not come later as many people came so the beach got pretty crowded. So we left at 2pm. We also should have come earlier.lucky that I could take some pics before all people arrived.,Date of experience: September 2019,Kavalikefta Beach,1,"Lefkada, Greece"
Good Catch ;-),We had so much fun spending the day on the fishing boat getting to know different sorts of fish while helping to get the fishes out of the nets.most of the fish we fished we Efi grilled and fried us and made us a amazing Lunch. We also stopped at two beaches where almost nobody was so cool.Too bad we haven't seen any seals or Dolphins or carettas but the animals have their own way of living so you can never know when or where they will appear. It was very relaxing to just enjoy the view of the neverending ocean and silence between. Thank you for a perfect last day on Kefalonia.,Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Horrible!!!!!!Don`t go there!!!!,"We just stayed one night but this was one night too much!
The only thing that looked good was the entry of the hotel!
The woman on the reception wasn`t very polite or nice at all. She wanted right away that we pay the hotel room and that was one point where we already should have been distrustful!!!!
And after we had arrived in our room we knew why she wanted the money before we had seen the room! it was ugly!!!!
We booked a double room instead of that we got a three bed room! And those ""beds"" weren`t even beds!!!!!! These were folding beds, very old ones!!!!!
The wall was distroyed everywhere!
The door handle in the bath room was broken!
The shower was not clean at all I bet they haven`t clean it since 3 years or something like that! So we couldn`t even take a shower that was very nasty!!!! But better than getting sick of the dirt in the shower right?!!!
We stayed out as long as we could so we spend as less time in that hotel room as we could.
We didn`t really sleep in that night. Once I took of the bedcover I almost had to throw up!!!! There were foreign black hairs on the bed everywhere!!!!!
There was a TV in the room but no remote control so there was just one channel....
Everywhere it was dusty!! I could wrote my name on the chair!!!
The receptionist gave us a sheet for the free W-lan. It didn`t work at all!!!!! Because the distance between the reception and our room was too big! Ridiculous!!!! We were in the first floor!!!
Look at my pictures here and you can see how horrible this hotel is!!!!!
And the pictures of their rooms on the internet I think they don`t even exist!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Date of stay: February 2013,Hotel Jaume I,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
