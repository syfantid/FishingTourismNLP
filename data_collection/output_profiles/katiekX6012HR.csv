Fantastic fishing trip,"We had the best time out with these lovely people. Not only was the fishing experience fantastic for the kids and us, but Efi’s cooking was incredible! They are all so hospitable and friendly. ️ The swimming in the sea was amazing and the beaches truly beautiful. A fantastic family day out. If you like seafood, sun and swimming then this is the trip for you!!",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
