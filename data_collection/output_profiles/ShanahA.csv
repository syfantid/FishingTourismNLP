Must have experience in Kefalonia,"Amazing authentic fishing experience! As a family of four with two little ones, we had a blast. Especially, the kids who were in awe of the fishing experience. Delicious lunch with wine and beer to top it off. Highly recommended!",Date of experience: July 2020,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Horrible Service,"Beverly the general manager is probably the rudest person I've ever met. Joanna, the group coordinator, is incompetent at best. I was in utter shock that a spa that claims to adhere to the highest level of service would hire such ill-mannered individuals. Unprofessionalism was unprecedented and like nothing I've ever experienced before. Spend your money elsewhere, do not go here.",Date of experience: July 2018,Spa Utopia,1,"Vancouver, Canada"
Great Experience!,It was hard to get ahold of the charter company at first but it was worth the effort. This was the perfect way to get our friends and family together before our wedding. It was a unique and wonderful experience for our group. Would love to do it again!,Date of experience: October 2012,Humu Humu Day Charters,1,"Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico"
