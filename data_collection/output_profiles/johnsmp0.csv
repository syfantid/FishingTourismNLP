Fishing Tour and Fish Lunch,"Had a great time with the crew! My wife and I enjoyed helping the crew retrieve traps, fishing nets and fishing with both reels and hand reels. We also enjoyed both swimming in a cove and the food that was cooked. Would recommend this to all of our friends and anyone wanting an experience!",Date of experience: May 2018,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
"Wine Tasting, Cooking Class and Dinner","My wife and I had a wine tasting and cooking class with Talia and the next day went back for dinner. Both trips to Aroma Avlis were wonderful! For the cooking class and wine tasting, it was very personal and the staff assisting were friendly, helpful and a pleasure to work with. And the food we cooked tasted great. For dinner, the food was phenomenal and the staff truly made an effort to make dinner a great experience. Would truly recommend to anyone!",Date of visit: May 2018,Aroma Avlis Food & Wine,5,"Santorini, Greece"
