Best fishing trip ever,"Just came back from a vacation on Skiathos and Skopelos. Lots of beautiful beaches and scenery. Among many things we (family of 4) went on a fishing trip with Dimitris. It was by far our best experience on Skiathos. Dimitris showed us many hidden “gems” that you can only reach by boat. The kiddos enjoyed the swims and they were ecstatic about the fish they caught. Dimitris is so great and fantastic with kids as well and he is all the time just really cool and relaxed. Totally service. All we needed was on board the boat.
We had a FANTASTIC trip and if I can totally recommend this trip to everyone, fishing or not.
This captain is great and will show you the best of the islands.
We’ll definitely come back for another trip.",Date of experience: May 2018,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
