Best activity we did in Santorini!,"We had an AMAZING time! The crew was welcoming, helpful, and extremely knowledgeable on the different types of fish we caught in the ocean! Out of everything we did in Santorini, this was the thing that we loved the most. The food was also incredible. The crew cooked up the fish/octopus that we caught, and had a variety of other dishes like Greek salad, rice, zucchini, shrimp, wine, and all different kinds of beverages. I would HIGHLY recommend this experience!!!",Date of experience: July 2019,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
