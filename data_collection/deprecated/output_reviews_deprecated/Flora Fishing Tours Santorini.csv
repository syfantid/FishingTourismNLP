Anthony, his father and mother were so friendly and welcoming and had thought of everything to make this trip a truly magical experience. If you are interested in taking a day trip on a boat in Santorini do yourself a favour and book this instead of the countless catamaran boats that are available. Whilst the catamarans race to squeeze in a 10 minute swim at the hot spring if you're lucky, we were able to take our time swimming and eat delicious freshly cooked fish.…"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irinabrouwer,August 2020,5,Forget the Oia sunset. This is the true heart and soul of Santorini,"We have never considered Santorini as a holiday destination because of its image - “masses of tourists chasing the sunset”. Until the COVID-struck 2020 brought us here and until we met the Prekas family who showed us the true Santorini.  I don’t want to make it a spoiler for any of you, moreover, one cannot describe in words what you are to experience on board the Flora fishing boat. As a taster: expect to come face to face with the heart and soul of the island, expect to live in 1/2 day through the range of emotions only a Greek, a Santorinian can. It’s all about the splendour of nature, the feast straight from the the sea and the family kitchen, the truest Greek celebration of life and love. We will probably be living and reliving this day for many more years to come. Thank you Kyriakos, Veta & Antoni. You are one incredible family!…"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yeehare,September 2020,5,Best boat tour on Santorini!,"Friends of ours booked this tour. When they called and gave us the description of what they had booked it sounded amazing. It turns out that you could never properly describe this tour in words - it HAS to be experienced in real life in order for you to understand just how amazing it is!   The combination of authentic Santorini fishing history, with a trip to the extinct volcano at Palea Kameni and all the sights that come with that, with amazing seafood and accompanying Greek salads, as well as all the beer and wine you can drink (and believe me, Captain Kyriakos will make sure you drink!) means that this trip makes the standard boat tours seem so basic in comparison. I challenge anyone to finish all the food that is put in front of you - it’s almost impossible!   And if you are a fan or music, and Greek music in particular, then this tour offers you something I guarantee you will never find from any of the other tour operators on the island. Father Kyriakos, son Antonis and mother Sveta are a family team who go above and beyond to ensure you step off the boat knowing without a doubt that you will carry with you memories that will last a lifetime. The tour ends with a special sunset surprise that I won’t mention now as it is amazing to experience without knowing what’s coming. Let’s just say that Antonis is a master of his art, and he entertains you in a way that leaves you with goosebumps, and photos and videos that will make all of your friends supremely jealous.   In summary, this tour is run by Captain Kyriakos, a Santorini legend, and his amazing son, a maestro in his own right, along with Sveta the matriarch, who can’t do enough to please the guests. Really, the only reason to choose a different boat tour on Santorini is if Flora is already booked. The memories will last long after your memory card is lost or deleted, and you can’t say that about many experiences these days. …"

We visited the volcano and did a sunset cruise. We were swimming in a beautiful bay and had an amazing dinner from fish, which they caught fresh before.

4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olga_boul,August 2020,5,Expected a fishing tour and ended with an experience for live,"Without hesitation I would recommend this trip to everyone - Families, couples or friends. It included fishing, live music, sightseeing, swimming and dining. The live music by Antonis and Kiriakos was so emotional and wonderful that it touched my soul. For the dining Vetta is preparing the fishes you caught yourself before and those are accompanied on the table by other traditional self made Greek food. What impressed me the most was that the whole family gives everything to give you one of the best days of your live - and this comes out of there heart. Thank you Vetta, Kiriakos and Antonis!…"
