Great trip and lovely views,"We have taken part in this trip with a group of 9 friends from poland. The staff was friendly and the views were beautiful. After 1 hour the boat stopped and we have a chance to explore caves with snorkeling mask, than we could jump into the water straight from the boat ! For more careful visitors ladder is also provided :) the food was delicious and the drinks were cold and refreshing, if I had a chance i would go on this trip once again",Date of experience: August 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
Very cosy tavern and great food,"We have visited this place with a group of 11 friends from Poland. Some of us ordered a glass of wine and we were given literally 4 or 5 bottles of them as a gift from the owner of the tavern. Both waiter and his uncle were very friendly, food was really good, when they saw us fighting with the bees they helped us smoaking coffee near our table which helped a lot :) really friendly staff. Later we were shown a cellar where the wine is made and received also some table grapes free of charge after we had eaten the main dishes. We all loved this place and really recommend everybody to stay here for a dinner",Date of visit: August 2019,Greek House,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
