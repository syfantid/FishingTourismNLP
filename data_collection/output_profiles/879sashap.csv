Delicious!,"My mom and I each ordered the apple Dutch pancakes with vanilla ice cream. The waiter mixed up our order and only placed it for one serving when we wanted two. But, he was new to his job and there is always a learning curb with any new position. Overall the pancakes are delicious, but perhaps there needs to be more training support for new staff?",Date of visit: September 2019,The Pancake Bakery,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Simply Amazing!,"This is such a gem of a hotel and I don't think I could ever fully capture just how amazing our stay was here (you'll just need to visit yourself!).

The hotel itself is well located, within walking distance to Vondelpark and the trams. It is only a 25 minute drive from the airport too. The breakfast was delicious and there is always something to order, no matter what time of day. There are also restaurants and stores nearby should you prefer to pick something up. But, the neighborhood is quiet and quaint.

We stayed in a Deluxe Room the first night and then moved into the Pillows Suite (as it was unavailable the first night). The staff moved our 8 suitcases (yes, we would pack less next time) into the suite effortlessly. Both rooms were comfortable, but the Suite of course was top notch. From the large soaker tub, sizable living area and cozy bed - we were practically at home!

By far the best part of this hotel is the staff. Everyone we met was professional, polite, kind and genuinely cared about our comfort. My baby was traveling with us and without the help of the staff here, our vacation would have been so stressful. From using their microwave to sanitize baby bottles to their provided high chair and crib; no detail was overlooked. While the hotel has an elevator, there are a couple of steps to get into the hotel (which seems to be standard for Amsterdam). The staff were always willing to help carry my daughter/stroller in and out of the hotel - she was treated like a princess!

I can not express enough gratitude to the staff especially at Pillows Anna van den Vondel for their care in ensuring our vacation (and my daughter's first trip to Europe) was special and memorable. From their recommendations (please book their walking tour with Alena - she is fantastic!), approachability (I must have emailed them 20 times before we even arrived) and overall good nature - we have so many fond memories of Amsterdam and it would not have been possible without the hospitality we received. THANK YOU!",Date of stay: September 2019,Pillows Luxury Boutique Hotel Anna Van Den Vondel,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Christmas Lights and Windows Tour - Must Do!,"What a wonderful tour, highly recommend it! Sylvia did a great job staying on top of our arrangements. In fact, we had this planned for the day we arrived into London and were so tired that we just needed to rest in our hotel. It was not a problem for Sylvia, she coordinated with the driver and rescheduled our tour to when we were more awake. Outstanding flexibility! The tour itself was lovely, Bob did an excellent job. His knowledge of London is wonderful and we learned a lot about the history of the various sites we saw. A must trip to take and a great way to see the attractions!",Date of experience: November 2017,Top Class Black Cab Tours,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Amazing Honeymoon!!!,"My husband and I first came here about two years ago when we got engaged. We loved it so much that we just came back from having our honeymoon there and boy was it amazing! We stayed in the honeymoon villa which is the classic Santorini cave style. Upon arrival there were beautiful roses decorating the main room. The hot tub, private pool, outside shower and outside cave bed were all so luxurious! Super private and the views overlooking the caldera were breathtaking. Every morning you can choose from a selection of breakfasts served right to your private terrace (Greek, honeymoon, American, and Continential). Our favorite was the Greek one, but I recommend switching it up to try all of the amazing food (the Greek yogurt with fruit and honey is out of this world!). The cleaning staff is excellent, everything smells so fresh and not a spot of dust.
The super star of the resort, as many others have commented, is of course Niko the concierge. He went above and beyond to ensure our honeymoon and my husband's 30th birthday (busy week lol) were the most memorable. He arranged a catamaran cruise and as the sun was setting the crew took out a surprise birthday cake for my husband (which Niko had snuck onto the boat) and we all sang happy birthday. It was so much fun! Then to top it off, when we got back to the villa, Niko had candles all over our terrace with champagne and chocolate mousse waiting for us to continue the celebration. We were beyond speechless by the level of care and thoughtfulness. Also, in previous correspondence I had mentioned to Niko that we would love to take a fishing trip. Well Niko did some research and surprised us when he was able to arrange an authentic Santorinian experience. Niko really listens to the details and goes above and beyond to delight. He feels like an old friend and Celestia Grand is so lucky to have him. We will continue to come back in the future - hopefully next time with kids! Thank you again Niko for everything!!!!

P.S. Bring some pool floats, we brought a flamingo and it was a lot of fun!",Date of stay: June 2017,Celestia Grand,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Best Gyro Ever!,"Stop here for a gyro - it's the best we have ever had and they put french fries in the middle. It's super packed, but service is fast. You won't be disappointed!",Date of visit: June 2017,Lucky's Souvlakis,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Once in a lifetime experience!!,"What a wonderful authentic Santorini finishing trip - perfect for both couples and families! You start the trip at the marina (transport to and from your hotel is an option) and then sail out to empty the traps first. We had a ton of shrimp and even a huge star fish (which we threw back in)!Then you go to another spot and start pulling in the nets. You can be as hands on as you'd like, but there is no pressure! My husband helped with the cages and I helped untangle the fish. Anthi and the crew's knowledge of all the different fish is fascinating and their respect for the ocean is admirable.

The crew cooks up the fresh catch for dinner and you can either help them prepare, go for a swim or both! They also have fishing rods and hand reels to try out. It was my first time with a rod and reel and I caught so many fish! I even hooked an octopus!! The whole crew jumped over to try to help me, but he was too feisty (apparently catching an octopus with rod and reel is very rare). What a thrill it was though! The food was delicious and then we cruised around to watch the sunset. Such a wonderful and unique experience, highly recommend it! Thank you Anthi for everything :)",Date of experience: June 2017,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Great time exploring Santorini!,"This is the second time that my husband and I have been to Santorini. We wanted a tour that would tailor to the things we had not yet seen. Our guide and driver did just that! At the start of the trip our guide asked what we'd like to do and then made sure they went above and beyond. We saw the lighthouse, monastery, the hiking trail, an old castle, a winery and also made little pit stops along the way. Five hours flew by! It was filled with fun and interesting facts and good humor. I would definitely book again!",Date of experience: June 2017,Santorini Day Tours by Dimitris P.,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Lovely Honeymoon Stay,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights in June on our honeymoon and had a wonderful time! The front of the building is gorgeous with all of the vines and flowers, which our windows overlooked (we stayed on the second floor, room 202 - Richard Meier Deluxe Room). The bed was comfortable (memory foam), plenty of space and the bathroom impressive (soaker tub with a separate two person shower). Good AC as well and complimentary water upon arrival. The location was fabulous, within walking distance to the Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Colosseum and Spanish Steps. It is about a 10 minute (7 euro) cab ride to Vatican City, but could be walked in 30 minutes. It was 95 degrees so we took the cab. The breakfast buffet was perfect. The freshly squeezed orange juice was a delight and the assortment varied (eggs, pancetta, French toast, pastries, yogurt, fruit, cereal, etc.). The restaurant upstairs was good, but a tad pricey. Keep in mind that it is vegetarian only. Service overall was good and they even sent us a complimentary bottle of Prosseco with macaroons to celebrate our honeymoon. Lastly, we enjoyed the artwork that decorated the hotel and clean feeling. We would stay here again!",Date of stay: June 2017,Bio Hotel Raphael - Relais Chateaux,4,"Rome, Italy"
Lovely start to our honeymoon!,"What a wonderful hotel! My husband and I stayed here two nights as the start of our honeymoon. We booked their honeymoon package and were not disappointed! Upon arrival they upgraded us and we walked in with rose petals on the bed. Breakfast was included, nothing extradorinaiy, but got us going for the day (eggs, pastries, cold cuts, etc.). The package also included a gondola ride which met off their private pier. This was a lovely 30 minute ride and nice way to get aquatinted with the city. There was no wait and we picked the time. We saw other gondola stations throughout Venice and it was complete chaos! We also had a complimentary meal at Atinoos, the food was beyond amazing! Great choice by our hotel and included a shuttle service (although I suggest walking back as the views are lovely). The location is perfect, about a 15 minute walk to St. Mark's square. Honestly, roaming the streets and getting lost is the best part of Venice! Overall service was fantastic and the hotel itself very clean. If you want a spot right on the Grand Canal then look no further!",Date of stay: June 2017,Sina Palazzo Sant'Angelo,4,"Venice, Italy"
Learned so much!!,"Our tour with Chiara was wonderful, it was of the Roman Forum and the Colosseum. It was certainly a hot day, but she made sure to find as much shade and fountains as possible to ensure our comfort. We also learned a lot. It was interesting to see the Roman Forum and Collosium (or as we learned Flavian Amphitheater) come to life through her stories, pictures and books. Her knowledge was fantastic and she was able to answer our questions with a commendable level of patience. Thank you Chiara!",Date of experience: June 2017,LivItaly Tours,4,"Rome, Italy"
Convenient Location,"I shared a hotel room with my mom here during our week long Paris stay. The hotel is quaint and the rooms are small, but after all it is Paris and were just fine. We had two single beds pushed together, but with separate bed covers. The bathroom is divided into two – the toilet in one room and the shower over bath in another. The tub was a little difficult for my mom to step in and out off, so if you anticipate similar challenges I recommend requesting a walk in shower when you book.

The room itself was clean, beds comfortable and overall pleasant. We had requested a balcony based on other’s reviews. Having the balcony was definitely a plus, especially for the extra space. If you are looking for views of the city though then book elsewhere. Our balcony overlooked the hotel across the street, which was not an issue for us. But, if you want something a bit more picturesque then you will be disappointed.

The continental breakfasts are in a small area within the basement and can get quite loud if crowded. However, the selection is decent (pancakes, meats, hard boiled eggs, fruit, yogurt, juices, assorted pastries, etc.) and provided a good start to our day. The only issue is that breakfast does not start until 7 AM, so some mornings we were unable to grab a bite as our tours left prior. I would recommend to Belloy Saint-Germain to start breakfast instead at 6 AM.

The location of the hotel is beyond convenient. It is super close to Notre Dame and Luxemburg Gardens, along with the Metro and bus stops. There are also really nice restaurants (highly recommend Bouillon Racine, which is on the same street) and supermarkets all within walking distance. However, if you plan on bringing your own car you may want to reconsider. We watched multiple people struggle to squeeze into spots along the street, one smashed a headlight and others were ticketed.

Overall my mom and I had two issues during our stay. Our room phone did not work and it took staff 5 days to replace it despite multiple requests. Also, be aware that the AC can become super noisy and somewhat questionable. Staff overall were friendly, but some were not the most helpful at times (ex. phone).

While the price seemed expensive, as other reviewers have commented, it is after all Paris and one needs to adjust their budget accordingly. I think if we came back to Paris (and I hope we can someday) that we would consider Belloy Saint-Germain based upon convenience and cleanliness, but may try another hotel within the area with better views.",Date of stay: September 2016,Hotel Belloy Saint-Germain,4,"Paris, France"
Wonderful!,"I highly recommend visiting the Musee d'Orsay. The interior is refreshing as it is an old train station and they have a lovely collection of paintings, especially Monet. You will not be disappointed!",Date of experience: September 2016,Musée d'Orsay,4,"Paris, France"
Breathtaking Views,We only went to the second floor as it was recommend by others that going to top was a waste of money (as at that point everything just looks like ants). The second floor was lovely and the views breathtaking. A must visit for anyone's first time in Paris!,Date of experience: September 2016,Eiffel Tower,4,"Paris, France"
So much to see,The Louvre is huge and our guide said it would take 9 months to see every piece! My biggest advise is plan in advance what you want to see so you do not become overwhelmed. My mom and I particularly enjoyed Napoleon III's apartments and they were not too crowded.,Date of experience: September 2016,Louvre Museum,4,"Paris, France"
Beautiful,These gardens are wonderful and so beautiful. They are not too crowded and are a great spot to relax and have a picnic.,Date of experience: September 2016,Luxembourg Gardens,4,"Paris, France"
Fabric Stores are Here!,"My mom and I did get a little lost here, but if you want to go fabric shopping then this is the place to go. I highly recommend Reine (multiple floors) and Le Coupons de Saint Pierre. If you only speak English then you may have some challenges and I recommend at least learning some French numbers to be able to ask for not only price, but to specify how many meters you'd like to buy.",Date of experience: September 2016,Montmartre,4,"Paris, France"
A Must See,"Don't let the long lines to enter stop you from visiting, as the queue does move quickly. Admission is also free and the building is cool, which is especially nice on a hot day. There is an option to go to the roof to tour the gargoyles, but we ran out of time and I am not sure if this costs money. Others however recommended it.",Date of experience: September 2016,Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris,4,"Paris, France"
Go in the Morning,"This was important for my mom to see and we went first thing in the morning. It was very peaceful and quite a few famous people are buried here. The cobblestone paths can be a bit hard to walk on, I recommend good walking shoes.",Date of experience: September 2016,Père-Lachaise Cemetery,4,"Paris, France"
Amazing Stay!!,"We stayed at Celestia Grand in the Erotas Villa for 4 nights in October and what an amazing experience! Niko was wonderful, full of great suggestions and always helpful. He spoiled us with watermelon and feta (surprisingly a great combo), helped us arrange a great photographer and even gave us a ride into town! He truly made us feel like we were the only ones there. The staff were friendly and the rooms immaculate. The view of the caldera with the volcano was breathtaking from our room, especially during sunset. We even had our own private pool (I suggest bringing pool floats, most guests do). I highly recommend anyone coming to Santorini to stay here. You will not be disappointed!!",Date of stay: October 2015,Celestia Grand,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Trip of a Lifetime!,"My friends and I had an amazing time! I would like to especially point out how awesome our driver Brahim was, he always went above and beyond! For example, I sadly deleted all of the pictures on my camera on the second day of our trip. Brahim told us not to worry and helped me to not only recover my photos, but gave me a replacement HD card. It was greatly appreciated! Also, we had a wonderful time with our tour guide Fettah in Fez. He was knowledgeable and friendly. Also, at the end of our tour we asked for his recommendation in a restaurant. Not only did he take us there, but he and Brahim came back to pick us up after to escort us to our riad. Overall, my friends and I always felt safe and well cared for with our driver and tour guides. Morocco was a blast! We loved all of the activities planned, the desert camp was amazing and fun! I have nothing but thanks for the hard work and planning put forth by the company. I certainly recommend anyone traveling to Morocco to go with Journey Beyond Travel. It honestly was a trip of a lifetime!",Date of experience: October 2013,Journey Beyond Travel,4,"Ifrane, Morocco"
