Friendly service,"Customer service is good, the food is OK. The food is good portion, but I'm not sure having raw bean sprouts and carrots in Pad Thai is a great idea.",Date of visit: July 2019,Tasty Thai,1,"Bellevue, Washington"
"Friendly staff and spacious room, but mediocre food and little to do","We stayed there for a week with full board starting 13th April.
Pros: friendly staff, spacious and clean room, live music each night, close to town;
Cons:
food quality is poor. It is really below my expectation, although the choices are plenty, the taste is not up to a 5-star standard;
The weather was cold and windy during our stay, as a result we found there is little to do at the hotel. My 6-year old gets really bored, as the outdoor pools aren't heated. The hotel tried to compensate it by allowing people to use the heated indoor pool for free, but only for two hours a day at lunch time;
The beach nearby is littered with rubbish. It doesn't take long to get there from the hotel. It is a rocky beach, which is OK. What shocks me is the amount of rubbish on it. I even see used syringe on the beach.",Date of stay: April 2019,Atrium Platinum Luxury Resort Hotel & Spa,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great fun for kids,My son and I had a great time fishing with another group of family on the same trip. The captain is very helpful to teach us the basics of fishing. I feel safe and relax for the whole trip. This is definitely the highlight of our week long stay at Rhodes.,Date of experience: April 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
"Clean, quiet and friendly",The room is very clean and quiet. The bed is very comfortable. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful. The provided free WiFi seems to be really fast too. Only downside is the breakfast doesn't have enough variety.,Date of stay: September 2018,Silver Cloud Inn Redmond,1,"Redmond, Washington"
"Good presentation, a bit noisy","Visited with a couple of friends. Food has got good presentation, service is not bad. I particularly enjoyed the beef noodle. The downside is the high background noise level. Not the best place to have a conversation.",Date of visit: September 2018,Din Tai Fung,1,"Bellevue, Washington"
Friendly and tasty,Great stuff. Lovely food and reasonable price. Very friendly staff. We visited quite a few times during our 2 weeks stay. Well definitely go again in the future.,Date of visit: June 2016,Restaurante Nogal,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
"Terrible waiters, never go in at your own risk","I have never experienced such terrible service anywhere in the world. The staff must be trained by the Gestapo. The first waiter was plain aggressive and kept shouting at us. We put up with him until he pushes my wife when she is blocking him accidentally. We decide to move table, the new waiter forgot one of our order, and when we ask nicely why we are missing a dish. The simple answer is""be patient"". Maybe we are a bit spoiled in the UK, but i would think this is unacceptable in any country.",Date of visit: August 2015,Hofbrauhaus,1,"Munich, Germany"
Mordern hotel with excellent service,"Very surprised to find the location is very close to the river. We can actually see the river in our room. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Wifi is very easy to set up and with good speed. The restaurant is descent, although a little bit on the pricey side. Breakfast is a bit boring though, we had it for the convenience rather than the quality of food.",Date of stay: December 2014,"Radisson Blu Scandinavia Hotel, Dusseldorf",1,"Düsseldorf, Germany"
"Great surroundings, friendly stuff, mediocre fecility","Visited there the first week of September this year. The caravan is clean and newish. Apart from mattress being too soft, I can't think of any other negative points. The resort is quiet and not far from a nice beach, only 5 minutes drive to multiple supermarkets. I would give 5 stars if the swimming pool is bigger, it's really a dedicated kids pool.",Date of stay: September 2014,Riviere Sands Holiday Park - Haven,1,"Hayle, United Kingdom"
Lovely scenery,"If you love cliff and big waves. This is a place you should visit. On the bonus side, you can see the seal colony nearby too. Not sure about 5 pounds parking charge, it's a bit steep for my taste.",Date of experience: September 2014,Godrevy,1,"Gwithian, United Kingdom"
Great place for football,"Great place for watching football. There are multiple big screens in the restaurant. The beer selection is a bit poor, the only local beer is out of stock when I visited.",Date of visit: September 2014,The Bluff Inn,1,"Hayle, United Kingdom"
Best pasty in the world,"I re-visited this place after 7 years. Very fond memory from previous visit. The pasty tastes great, the stuff are friendly. I hope it will stay there forever.",Date of visit: September 2014,Philp's Famous Pasties,1,"Hayle, United Kingdom"
Authentic food,"Pros: From China myself, I do think they produce the most authentic Chinese food in Cambridge. I have been visiting them for about 3-4 years now, seven days have become my de facto place to go for a hearty Chinese meal.
Cons: food quality became inconsistent for about a year now. I start to wonder whether they have got a trainee chef......",,Seven Days,1,"Cambridge, United Kingdom"
"Great location, reasonable price, value for money!","It’s within walking distance to the train station and close to many restaurants. The receptionists are very friendly and helpful. Room condition is al-right, I really like the blinds on the window, which can create a total blackout. Breakfast is OK, but I was a bit annoyed to find out that you have to ask the waitress if you want any meaty food, as they are either stack away or not refilled. To sum up, it’s a cheap and cheerful place to stay if you want to explore Rome on foot, as we have used it as a base to walk to most attractions like the Colosseum.",Date of stay: November 2013,Hotel Verona,1,"Rome, Italy"
Average hotel with parking places,"We went there for a short stay of 3 nights. The room is clean yet basic. There view out of the window is dull. It's fine for the 1st night, but we just can't bear to stay there any longer at the 2nd and 3rd ones.

It's relatively cheap due to the location, but if you are driving like we do. It's quite convenient to pop in your car to get to all the attractions in the city.

In summary:

Pros:
Clean;
Free parking;
Helpful staff;

Cons:
Lack of characters;
Location isn't very convenient;
Basic breakfast",Date of stay: December 2012,Holiday Inn Salzburg City,1,"Salzburg, Austria"
