Great location and friendly staff,"Thanks so much we had a great 3 night stay, the location is A++++ the pool is great and pizzas great and dinner buffet is actually really good and at I think it was $22 each for dinner is really cheap for all you can eat. Want to make a special mention to Monique who organised a bottle of champagne along with a card as we had just got engaged it was such a nice touch and completely unexpected but made our night. Will certainly be back and is a great base on the island for day trips you can’t go wrong.",Date of stay: February 2019,Eurong Beach Resort,1,"Fraser Island, Australia"

Never again,"We went there for dinner after my partner bought his brand new car ( NOT Drinking) was in the best mood and having a laugh with friends we haven't seen for years from over seas

We bought the most expensive bottle of champion of the menu as well as food and serval coffees and since we where having such a great time they thought we were drunk so the manager which we have a feeling is the owner maybe? Came and refused to give us any drinks.

What a world this has come to when people see you laughing and having a great time they think your drunk.

Just disgusting and such a waste of the night

Will never go there again

If you want a good night out with friends don't go here go to mcDonald's",Date of visit: June 2016,Whitewater,1,"Manly, Australia"

Sigh of relief,We had a very bad experience at Cut bar and grill (first time I've ever walked out of a restaurant) we both thought where is great service and remembered here and we were even happier to find out Nick was still working there he is by far the best and makes this place so what started as a terrible night ended up fantastic the steaks and service are impeccable.,Date of visit: February 2016,Prime Steak Restaurant,1,"Sydney, Australia"
Counting down the days,My partner and I stayed at qualia in September for our 9 year anniversary and plan to come back every 6 months for a mini break to recharge as the views and service you can't help but relax! It's an amazing place and I think I've thought of qualia everyday since I've been there and dying to go back and so lucky will be back there again in less than 2 weeks time. Every employee there truly cares and looks after you and the seafood at Pebble Beach was so fresh. You cannot go wrong this place is amazing!,Date of stay: September 2015,Qualia Resort,1,"Hamilton Island, Australia"
