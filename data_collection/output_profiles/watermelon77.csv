Unbelievable Day,"We were a group 3 adults and 2 kids (age 12 and 9) and had the most amazing experience with Gerry and his team at Pefkos.
We had never considered diving and were really quite apprehensive but after trying the diving equipment in the pool first and knowing we could walk in from the beach rather than by boat we decided to try it.
From the minute we arrived all the staff were so friendly and kind and Gerry's safety brief was brilliant and calmed any nerves. Im not sure I would have managed the experience had the staff not been so wonderful.
Once in the water there was a helper diver for each person and they were brilliant and Gerry was so calm in the water it put you at ease. I didn't catch the name of my helper unfortunately but thank you!
We spent around 25 minutes in the water each dive and it was utterly incredible and an absolute highlight of our holiday. The photos and videos came through by email later that day and are totally brilliant. The kids who are used to lots of outdoor activities had the time of their lives.
Thanks you Gerry and the team :-)",Date of experience: July 2019,The Waterhoppers Diving School,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
fantastic experience,"We were a family group of 7 people, 5 adults and 2 kids (age 9 and 12).
This trip was a highlight of our holiday. The captain and his mate were so helpful and patient it was a delight to be onboard. We had loads of fishing time and jumped in from the boat to snorkel. The captain grilled the amazing fresh fish on the BBQ and served it with delicious bread and greek salad, we all agreed it was the best meal of the holiday, it was incredible. Considering the meal was included in the cost it was such great value for money.
The trip is wonderful for families and all ages, we had an amazing time and would highly recommend it.",Date of experience: July 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
