Snorkeling and fishing bliss,Had an unbelievable day out in the crystal clear waters surrounding Poros with our captain Giannis. We watched as he spear fished two Parrot fish for our lunch as we snorkeled at beautiful protected spots along the coast. As 6 friends in their late 20s this was the perfect day exploring the island for us. Giannis is a wonderful cook and has incredible expert local knowledge. Would highly recommend and will be coming back on our next trip!,Date of experience: July 2019,Poseidon Fishing Trips,5,"Poros, Greece"
