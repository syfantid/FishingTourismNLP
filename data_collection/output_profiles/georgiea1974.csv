Staff and location brilliant!,"Staff and location brilliant!
Went today before lockdown no2.
Staff and service were brilliant and the pizza are the best pizza express pizzas!

I have been a pizza express customer for at least 30 years and the cooks here are one of the best. A credit to the franchise team.
Thanks guys and good luck for the next lockdown. Let’s hope it doesn’t last more than 4 weeks",Date of visit: November 2020,Pizza Express,1,"Salisbury, United Kingdom"
Brilliant service under covid,"Brilliant service under covid conditions.
Nice atmosphere, busy and a lovely evening out.
The food was good pub food.
Staff were very friendly and Shelly was great too!
Thank you so much and I’m sorry you have to close again for lockdown.
Good luck guys.",Date of visit: November 2020,Fox and Hounds,1,"Wimborne Minster, United Kingdom"
Family room bunk beds with teenagers,"Booked this hotel with 2 teenage boys. 14&15. Given a family interconnecting room.
Crikey: it was a large wardrobe with bunk beds in. Hardly great for teenage boys.
So there starts the teenage rows as they had to sleep on our sofa bed! Now paying for a ‘cupboard’ they can’t use.

Service with a smile...lacking.
Breakfast....mediocre.
Outdoor terrace...not the best service but pizzas awesome!!
View....to die for. And this is simply how this hotel survives. The rest is like a hi de hi.

Stupid covid arrows everywhere which are uncalled for really.

They say no toilets available accept for your rooms. However public toilets are open nearly everywhere now.

Lazy staff and management ????

Look out of your balcony and the old deserted tables, sand and furniture has been stacked there forever. No cleaning has been done during lock down at all.

They need to up their game or reduce their prices as this is a 2-3 star hotel at the most. But in a 5 star area. So don’t expect a lot when you arrive. Wish I had taken photos to show the mess on the terrace.",Date of stay: August 2020,Sandbanks Hotel,1,"Poole, United Kingdom"
Dinner,"I had chicken Caesar salad and my husband had fish and chips.
His looked amazing. Mine...was not worth the money. I couldn’t even take a photo of mine it wasn’t anything to shout about. I was so disappointed because I used to love eating here.

Luckily the atmosphere made up for it.",Date of visit: August 2020,Jazz Cafe,1,"Poole, United Kingdom"
Much better than its sister hotel the sandbanks.,"Our room was basic but lovely and clean. 220. Overlooking old Harry rocks. Divine.
No one can fault the 5 star view.

We had lunch on the terrace. We ordered a bottle of wine and chicken burgers. The food arrived, we ate, and when we finished we had to go to the bar to ask where our wine was. Never known that in my life for food to arrive and not the drinks!!

There was one lady at the bar. She was over worked. In fact, all the staff were. This was disappointing and took away from our relaxing lunch. We complained but not compensation was offered.

Under these Covid circumstances with beautiful weather, and in turn busy occupancy, I don’t understand why the limited staff are being stretched. They could easily employ local people (who are all looking for jobs during this time) and give the guests the service that they are paying for.

The covid floor one way stickers were such over kill that everyone ignored them and were also very confusing anyway.

The pool bar was closed. So there was only one place to order drinks from...and that as I already mentioned was too busy.

There was a guest who we overheard on his phone to lots of his friends saying that the staff were stretched and service not as it should be.

Charge high money for a nights stay then not give the service that people are paying for.

Luckily the sun shone and that’s what made our stay.

No interaction from the reception staff on arrival except for all the covid rules. There must be more personal contact when paying this kind on money.

A massive lack of atmosphere, but I would return purely because I don’t live that far away so it was nice to have a break away with my husband. Shame it was let down by the over worked staff and lack of everything else.",Date of stay: August 2020,Haven Hotel,1,"Poole, United Kingdom"
Quick lovely pub lunch,"Having heard the previous managers were no longer running the pub we decided to pop by for lunch and see if the food had gone back to the great way it used to be.
I ordered the Welsh rarebit which was served with chips and salad.
It was fabulous!
The difference in my review now to the one in August is 100% better!

Joe, the manager back in charge, is turning things back to the way it used to be, good quality, reasonably priced pub food.

Would happily return with the family in tow.",Date of visit: October 2019,The Cricketers,1,"Blandford Forum, United Kingdom"
Poor food,"I am sorry to write this review as we are a local family but this is why we try and support the local pubs, but for hard earned money, don’t want to be disappointed.

I was unfortunately.

To be fair, I had to be honest to the waitress and I did get £5 knocked off my bill.

I ordered Welsh rarebit. I’ve had it before about a month ago so knew it was nice.

It arrived, it was cold when I cut into it (I presume from a freezer heated up?). The chips were the dregs of the fryer.

When I mentioned it to the landlady the reason for the chips was due to the fat frier. This was repeated about 4 times. The chips weren’t ‘whole’ chips, but the broken ends and re cooked. Nothing to do with “changing the fat on a Sunday so it depends on what day you have chips”

The rarebit was cold and thick and didn’t taste of cheese at all. She told me that this was the new recipe.

I agree it was good to have money knocked off my bill, but I still paid for our food, drinks and experience and all I had were excuses (ie my fault for not liking the food).

Would think again about going to this local village pub. Shame as it is a managed pub and no idea what’s going on in the kitchen as the food used to be very very good.",Date of visit: July 2019,The Cricketers,1,"Blandford Forum, United Kingdom"
Slickly disappointing,"Went on a highly recommended review from my cousin.
Attended. Teenage sons ordered pepperoni pizzas (standard!).
Came with mushrooms on.
The waitresses said they would remake without mushrooms.

They actually charged us for 3 pizzas.

So we ordered 2 pepperoni.
Remade without mushrooms. Totals 4.
But because we didn’t read the menu properly they met half way and charged us for 3. Ummmm

Experienced travels around the world and never ever known pepperoni on a pizza.
Customers fault I guess for not reading the menu.",Date of visit: July 2019,Arka Ristorante&Pizzeria,1,"Bodrum City, Turkey"
5 out of 10,"We have spent a lot of time in Turkey in the past. So no offence meant by my comments but to me the holiday experience is about being there and seeing what’s out and about.

All inclusive, you don’t see any of this.

Luckily Bodrum is a 6-7 euro taxi ride away and we went out 5/7 nights to town. Purely to see the shops/market, buy nice ice cream, eat nice food and soak up the atmosphere.

At the TUI hotel I would say the following:

WIFI -
Excellent, even at the beach and never drops out.

ROOMS -
Mattresses...no different to lying on a sun lounger so we were really looking forward to getting home to our own beds.

Mini bar - they tell you they restock the water every day and it’s free. It is free but they don’t restock it every day so be prepared to bring water back from the bars to your room. Soft drinks - they said the fridge is free first time round and then they charge afterwards to restock this. Utter rubbish as there is no way of policing that.

Balconies - main building - tiny!! Worth paying for a sea view though, as we did, otherwise you could have no view at all.

Cleaning - very good and ladies very sweet.

Mosquitos - yes they are around so keep your doors shut!

Check out - have to vacate the rooms by 12pm. You have to pay more to keep the room until later. DONT! What they don’t tell you is that you store your bags in the reception area, then you can shower for free at the spa (all ages) and this saves you a few bucks.

FOOD:
. Not to our liking really.
Repetitive
Ice creams - 1 out of 10.
Hot chocolate machine for the kids - quite often not working.
I’ve probably let come home slimmer than when I arrived!

POOL:
Lilos....everywhere!
Reserve beds....yes.
Could we be bothered....no!

My husband witnessed, at the pool bar, a girl/lady asking the bar staff to fill up a babies bottle with coke. He did a double take, and when they filled it with coke she screwed on the teat. It was for a baby. No wonder there are health problems around the world! Maybe that is more a personal comment or judgement of class of people around the world, but not whom we would choose to holiday with.

TUI - on the whole okay, but your reception staff need to speak better English and the restaurant needs to up their game.

Would we return - no.
Did we have a nice holiday - yes ish!
Family of 5:
Myself and my husband.
Daughter aged 16
Sons aged 13 & 14.
None of us said we would do all inclusive like this ever again.

But it is what it is, and once again, I seriously need to up our budget!!!

Happy holidays!",Date of stay: July 2019,TUI MAGIC LIFE Bodrum,1,"Bodrum City, Turkey"
Perfect day on a boat,"Where do I start?!
Fabulous hosts, beautiful boat, clean and tidy!
Lyn was such great company with brilliant communications about our trip from first enquiry to the actual day.

We went with our 3 teenage children and another family so it was more or less private hire.

The food was amazing, salad, chicken and pasta for lunch, fruit for afternoon snacks. All lovingly prepared.

We saw all the pirate and busy boats pass us by playing loud music and we were so glad not to be on them!!

As and when we return to Bodrum we would book again, and we would highly recommend this boat.

Lyn took so many lovely photos of us and the children jumping in. To care about your guests is lovely. And we got on so well, it was like being with friends!

Thank you guys and we wish you a wonderful summer. Xx",Date of experience: July 2019,Adorya Daily Private Boat Trip,1,"Bodrum City, Turkey"
Excellent comms and reliable servixe,"Booked a transfer from bodrum to our tui hotel as prefer private transfers rather than being sat on a coach with lots of stops etc.
They charged us 35 euro cash on arrival for our transfer.
Clean modern large taxi for a family of 5.
Very good service and would defiantly use again. Thanks guys!",Date of experience: July 2019,Shuttle Board,1,"Bodrum City, Turkey"
Quick lunch - disappointing,"Popped for lunch with the husband while the kids attended a birthday party at dorset water park.
The food wasn’t great. I ordered a veg/bean chilli. The serving was massive and it didn’t taste nice at all. Chopped veg in an awful tomato sauce. The menu wasn’t that inspiring but wish I went for a baguette or something else instead. Felt disappointed to waste our money on eating here. Also when you walked in you could smell kitchen fat.
Haven’t been for years and wouldn’t attend again. Sorry no photo of my meal.",Date of visit: June 2019,The Bankes Arms Country Inn,1,"Studland, United Kingdom"
"Wow - staff, service and food","Came to Mallorca with my friend.
Out of 4 nights we ate here for 3 of them.
Service was spot on.
Food beautiful.
Ambience fab.

The staff were amazing. For that reason we returned every night. Luckily quite select so let a lot of the typical magaluf parties walk on by.",Date of visit: May 2019,Bondi Beach Magaluf,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Family holiday with teenagers,"We stayed here for a week with our 3 children (16,14,12). I was slightly apprehensive before we arrived as I was worried that there wouldn’t be enough for the kids to do. But luckily with it being the Easter holidays there were other teenagers there so they all hung out together. The majority of guests are older and travelling as couples.

The daytime entertainment was fine. Beach volleyball twice a day, water walking (on a mat they put into the pool) & a free pool table in the bar area up the hotel. There is table tennis by the mini club but it’s so windy that when you go to serve the ball blows away! We did recommend to the manager that they try to find somewhere else to put it as it sits there redundant.

The free WiFi was excellent!! No problems downloading anything and connection worked wherever you were, even at the beach.

We went to the sister hotel one morning to use the pool. It is defiantly a busier hotel and actually we preferred our hotel.

Hardly any queues to get a drink and the service and friendliness of the staff was excellent. Plenty of sun beds so no having to reserve early in the mornings.

We had lovely weather all week (once I got used to the constant breeze!).

We ate in the Japanese one evening. Starter was okay, but the main meal awful. Everything over cooked so we left it. (See photo of vegetable fried rice - was stewed!)
We didn’t try the steak house as other guests said that the food wasn’t great at all and again, everything over cooked. Buffet food in restaurant good, but tbh I get very bored with buffet food.

We paid 10 euros at the airport and jumped in a taxi. We were checked in and on our way to our room by the time the coach arrived so well worth doing!

A clean, friendly hotel on a beautiful windy beach.",Date of stay: April 2019,Hotel Riu Palace Boavista,1,"Boa Vista, Cape Verde"
Sunday lunch,"Lovely, stunning Sunday roast with family/friends. Opted for mains and pudding.
Good atmosphere. Attentive staff and service.
The roast itself was excellent. Our son wanted more gravy, asked, and it arrived!
We all rated the Sunday main course to a very high standard. Fabulous flavour and a brilliant Yorkshire pudding!
Only let down was the desert - we chose the banana cake with sauce. It was pretty dry with no sauce at all. In hindsight should’ve gone for the traditional crumble with custard, so not necessarily the pubs fault but ours!
Overall for the whole meal etc 9 out of 10. Well done guys! Can’t wait to return. Thank you very much for a lovely meal.",Date of stay: October 2018,The Lamb Hindon,1,"Hindon, United Kingdom"
Perfect Sunday Lunxh,"Wow! The service was excellent and staff attentive.
The boys said the roast beef was excellent.
I opted for the vegetarian nut roast and it was amazing.
The variety and flavour of the side vegetables was great.
We ordered a side of cauliflower cheese which was very tasty!

Went as a family along with friends. We had a great time.
Since then we have been to the Langton arms and it was no comparison to the crown. Plus the Langton charge about £3 more per adult for an over cooked roast.

Off to try the lamb in hindon for our next outing! But will defiantly come back to the crown very soon!
Fantastic value for money and worth every penny. Well done guys!",Date of stay: August 2018,The Crown Hotel,1,"Blandford Forum, United Kingdom"
Poor standard,"Came for Sunday lunch with friends. Very dated table lay outs (doilies on plates, old fashioned flower arrangements etc).
Food - like a school lunch (as quoted by our 16 yr old daughter). Boiled veg (not big helpings), anaemic roast potatoes, beef very tough (not hand carved either). For an extra £1 or so can eat in a few other local very good ‘destination’ pubs. Catering for the masses. Sorry but wouldn’t recommend or go back again. 2/10
Would’ve given them our feedback but no one asked us when we left how our meal was.",Date of visit: September 2018,The Langton Arms,1,"Tarrant Monkton, United Kingdom"
Awesome,"Words from the 13 year old son “it was awesome and we want to go again”

Words from the 12 year old son “it was amazing and I would definitely go again”

You are guaranteed to catch fish which is all the wanted! Husband took the 2 boys while the girls relaxed at the hotel.

Thank you guys for wonderful communication and a great trip.",Date of experience: July 2018,Sostis & Saratonga Faliraki Fishing Trips,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Highly recommend. Party of 20 people.,"Being a large group of ladies, arriving around 8.30pm on a busy Saturday night, I wanted to ensure things went smoothly for our party so we could all relax and enjoy.

I got everyone’s menu choice and emailed them to the restaurant a week before our arrival so that they knew what we were going to order. I think this took a huge pressure away from the staff on the evening, as that many people browsing the menu and choosing what they would like to eat would take forever. (tip: if u do this put persons name next to their order incase they forget what they ordered!).

I also requested water and pre ordered wine to be ready on the table for when we arrived ✅. This meant that from the moment we sat down we didn’t have to wait for any service. We could just concentrate on having a lovely time.

The staff were really amazing. They were efficient, friendly and attentive.
There was a suggested service charge on the bill of 10% to which we were more than happy to pay as it was well deserved.

Lovely atmosphere ✅
Amazing food ✅
Wonderful service ✅
Would highly recommend ✅

Just gutted I don’t live locally as I’d love to go there for supper again tonight!!",Date of visit: July 2018,Palm Pan Asia,1,"Winchester, United Kingdom"
"Easter break with the children 11, 13 & 15","A weeks holiday to escape work & the British weather.
Bkd via TUI but emailed the hotel directly to request interconnecting rooms and ideally rooms which had afternoon/evening sun. This was granted! Block B overlooking the lake.

Food - the only snag I would say is there is 1 main restaurant to eat in - morning, noon & night. So it does get slightly repetitive. Would prefer an all inclusive where you can eat in different restaurants. They do have 1 a la Carte restaurant which you can book one evening for free. We actually went to a local bar/pizzeria one evening which is about a 2 minute walk from the hotel for a change (pizzas were excellent, it’s called beach hut).

Evening entertainment - ummmm, chairs set out like your in a theatre/on a cruise (not that I’ve been on one before!) and quite dull really with no atmosphere.

Relieved that other teenage children are here too as I was worried that the kids wouldn’t meet friends. The animation staff do beach volley ball, rifle shooting, table tennis etc so the kids can dip in and out of what they like, when they like. My boys loved it!

25 euros in a taxi gets you to Siam water park.

Really lovely resort. Plenty of sun beds available with not too much towel bagging early doors!",Date of stay: March 2018,Barceló Tenerife,1,"Tenerife, Spain"
Great fun learning a new skill,"Didn’t think I’d master the machine, but with a little extra help from the guys, I managed! A fun trip along the streets to a golf cafe for a drink, then back again to the hotel. Trainers a must.

Fabulous food,...and good service too. Booked 2 nights running for around 5.30 sitting so it wasn’t too busy. Great food.,Date of visit: January 2018,Restaurant Les Fontaines Blanches,1,"Avoriaz, France"
Perfect stop for lunch,Great hot dogs for 5 euros which the children loved. Nice mulled wine! Good service and great food selection. All cooked fresh.,Date of visit: January 2018,Le Yeti,1,"Avoriaz, France"
Fantastic bar as the name suggests!,"Went 4 times on our trip to avoriaz. The staff were all very friendly and they work very hard to achieve a high standard service.
Food was also very good as ate here one evening.",Date of visit: January 2018,Le Fantastique,1,"Avoriaz, France"
...if you have lots of time on your hands and aren’t bothered about good service...,"....then this is the place to go.
We went as a group of 4 adults and 4 children on a few occasions during our stay in avoriaz.

The service was sooooo incredibly slow and the staff quite nonchalant. Plenty of them making themselves look busy but not towards guests. The wait for drinks was long and quite often not the full order being delivered.
We cleared the empty glasses from the table ourselves as the staff seemed incompetent of noticing any detail like that.

One afternoon we checked the bill and they had added a portion of fries to it. I gave it back to the lady, she then removed them from the bill BUT when she bought the revised bill back to us she put it on the table where the children were sitting. We were quite flabbergasted!
We paid it with another waiter then screwed up the bill. The lady then came over asking if we were going to pay in cash and we had to tell her we had already settled it.

Anyway, enough moaning (and I could go on about this place) but spend your money elsewhere (like fantastic in town is fantastic and a few euros cheaper)",Date of visit: January 2018,Le Chapka,1,"Avoriaz, France"
Wow! Keep this gem a secret!,"We came to visit Capri to see my Italian family who live here. But unlike 17 years ago when we last came, we were bringing our 3 children with us (because 17 yrs ago we had none!).
Not the cheapest island in the world but one of the most beautiful!

Capri Town Apartments we found by chance and my cousins said it was a good place to stay.

We were welcomed warmly by the brother and sister who own and run the apartments. They gave us any information we needed and left us to it, but were there if we needed them anytime.

The apartment is literally 30m from the main piazza in central Capri. Everything right on the doorstep.

There are 2 apartments. We are a family of 5, so our apartment consisted of 2 bedrooms (1 large double and 1 large room which fitted 3 single beds comfortably), a kitchen area, 1 bathroom. Great wardrobe space and everything required for a comfortable stay.

The apartment is cleaned everyday and towels changed every 2 days. Just like a hotel! The apartment is modern and lovely. The best thing is the large terrace (shared with the other apartment) with the most stunning views towards the marina. We sat here every evening before going out into town for dinner. Bought wine and crisps from the local supermarket and sat and relaxed.

There isn't one negative that any of my family have had staying at the Capri Town Apartments (and that's saying something!). I would highly recommend anyone looking to book somewhere in Capri to stay here.",Date of stay: August 2017,Capri Town Apartments,1,"Island of Capri, Italy"
Dinner,"Good food. Would recommend. But being August staff aren't too attentive
Pizzas are nice

Perfect family getaway with wonderful facilities,"This is the second time that we have stayed at Mer-Can Story.
The pool is peaceful and lovely with plenty of sun loungers and all day sunshine.
The beach, directly outside the entrance, provides free sun loungers, waiter service and glorious sunshine!
The food is great (normal stuff like salads, burgers, Turkish breakfast, pancakes etc) and more importantly the kitchen is kept very clean.
The staff are very helpful and attentive. Mustafa is a great manager/owner.
We have stayed in an apartment and also a 2 bedroomed villa here. All the facilities that you need - fridge, towels. A nice and modern place to stay.

My children (14,12,11) wandered freely to the little shop along the beach front to buy ice creams, sat and ordered breakfast or food at the restaurant at Mer-Can, played cricket on the beach, played backgammon at the bar, enjoyed the free wifi.

All the perfect things that holidays are made of!

All of my family would have no hesitation in recommending this place to stay or the area as a resort. Thank you to all at Mer-Can Story, from the Andrews family!",Date of stay: July 2017,Mer-Can Story Apart Hotel,1,"Yalikavak, Turkey"
Nice and relaxed!,"Good looking bar.
Nice vibe of background music.
Good service.
Sit back and watch the crazy people walk past!
Probably best most respectable bar along that beach stretch! Good for couples or small group of friends.",Date of visit: May 2017,Chalet Siena,1,"Majorca, Spain"
"Modern, clean and good value for money","Escaped away from family life with a friend for a 4 day break.

Sun was priority, followed by relaxation and a nice hotel near a beach/Palma.

Being a new hotel and not being many reviews I wasn't quite sure what it would be like but I can report the following:

It is modern, clean and contemporary.
2 very large pools. Beach towels provided. Comfortable sun loungers and plenty of them (no one reserving them with towels nonsense going on, despite a lot of the guests being German!). Waiter service round the pool.
Glass of wine costs around 3.5 euros, corona 4 euros. Fairly priced I thought.
Civilised guests, no large rowdy groups.
Yes, sister hotel being built next door but the building noise isn't that bad at all.

Food - we opted for the half board option as it wasn't much more in price. This is only for breakfast and dinner. No lunch (can be paid for at the pool bar).
Breakfast was lovely - everything you want, cheeses/fruit/waffles/full english/omelettes etc.
Dinner - again, typical buffet style but good quality food. Staff very helpful and welcoming.

30 seconds walk to beach and bars/shops.

As previous review mentioned, there is the large ""mega park"" bar across the street, but to be honest once our balcony door was closed, we couldn't hear it.

Rooms - very large, large balcony, small fridge, large wardrobes etc.

Would I come again? Yes (and hopefully with my husband!) A short hop from the airport. Close proximity to Palma.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it if you like quality but can't quite afford the budget of the higher class hotels (as in, over £1k).",Date of stay: May 2017,Hipotels Gran Playa de Palma,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Beautiful apartments,"Wow! We stayed here as a family of 5. Clean, modern and light apartment. Warm welcome when we arrived.
Couldn't have been more helpful with anything that we needed.
Such a lovely place to stay.
In the centre of town with the ski bus stop outside and supermarkets within a minutes walk.
Would highly recommend. Thank you for a memorable first family skiing holiday (not so happy that my children can now ski faster than me!) x",Date of stay: February 2017,Traumplatzl,1,"St. Michael im Lungau, Austria"
Good food,"Great food for the whole family. Service with a smile would be nice though.
We are there for 4 nights on the go, and there was no ""welcome back"" feeling. Maybe it is due to the staff not being able to speak good English? The lady who works the bar is very nice though.
Charged 1 euro for a glass of tap water, even though we have spent hundreds of euros over 4 evenings. Customer service could be improved but the food is great.",Date of visit: February 2017,Pizzeria Restaurant la Piazza,1,"St. Michael im Lungau, Austria"
Relaxing holiday,"We were upgraded to a 2 bedroomed suite which was stunning.
Beach and pool areas clean and relaxing.
Food okay.
Staff friendly.
Tip - buy water and drinks from the onsite mini market as far cheaper than from hotel bars.
Children enjoyed it - table tennis on the beach, football etc.",Date of stay: April 2016,Sofitel Dubai The Palm,1,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
Highly recommend the short boat trip,"Took our 3 children age 9,10,12. We went on the smaller speedboat. There were about 6 other people onboard.
Perfect duration of 2 hours.
Captain was friendly.
Stopped for swimming twice in the beautiful clear water.
Snorkels are provided so don't worry if you don't have your own.

The children loved it, jumping off the boat etc.

We passed by many of the other larger popular boat cruises and to be honest with you, on our speedboat, in a small group, I couldn't help but feel really happy with our decision for booking the shorter trip with the dolphin boat safari!!

Would highly recommend.

A perfect end to our holiday!",Date of experience: July 2015,Dolphin Boat Safari,1,"Ayia Napa, Cyprus"
Upgraded then downgraded!,"Don't be fooled by the original hotel name (Ritz Carlton!) - experienced the upgrade and downgrade!

We had a short 4 night break at this hotel.
After reading previous reviews we were very excited about our stay.

When we arrived we decided to pay the £60 per night upgrade to 'Royal Club' as other people had said on trip advisor that it was great and worthwhile. We had a pool/sea view room, access to the Club Lounge, private beach and use of any al a carte restaurant.

The Club Lounge - while the service was good, the room/terrace itself is very dated and no atmosphere at all (some quiet playing background music would be nice). Food selection here very minimal.

Our Royal room was okay - the mini bar/fridge was not stocked at all. Mentioned this to various members of staff on a number of occasions but still was not stocked. The manager said that we can get our drinks from the Club Lounge. 2 small bottles of water were left in our room on a daily basis...not sufficient enough for hot climes. We called Room Service to request some more water about 11pm one evening to be told that we would be charged for this. I had to get slightly stroppy and said that for all inclusive (and upgrade Royal Club) that this should be free. Finally got it delivered for free!

Private Beach - quite nice. Right next to the standard hotel beach. The only difference of course being that you get butler service. However, they aren't on hand the whole time so sometimes it was quicker and easier to get a drink ourselves from the standard hotel beach bar, which was a 30 second walk!

Upon reflection of this we spoke to the Manager and explained that we would like to DOWNGRADE and have a refund for the rest of our stay for the extra money that we had paid on arrival. This was honoured. We just didn't really feel that the upgrade was worth the extra money.

So - onto then being a normal All Inclusive guest!

We moved to a pool view room by the lazy river/top pool. Same decor (and more or less same size) as the Royal Club room. Mini bar/fridge....you guessed it...not stocked! 2 small bottles of water only! Toiletries not replenished (ran out of shampoo), toilet roll had to ring to request more when ran out. After speaking to a few members of staff, our mini bar was finally stocked by 4pm the day before we were due to checkout! NOTE - your mini bar is only stocked with soft drinks ONCE for the duration of your stay (unless you are on the Ultra package I think). Glad we weren't staying for a 2 week holiday!

Breakfast - not being a Royal Club guest now we went to the main restaurant for breakfast. I nearly died when I was about to help myself to fresh orange juice and was told that I had to pay extra for this!!! Surely fresh orange juice is standard?! Even in cheap B&Bs in the UK you get orange juice! The equivalent was a disgusting type of orange squash. By then I had had enough and took it to the Executive Chef who was swanning around to ask him if he had actually tried the orange squash himself! I was then offered a free fresh orange juice!

Pyramid Bar - by lazy river/top pool. Went there for lunch one day - the food was SO disgusting. All we ordered was a cheese toast and chips from the menu (had heard the other stuff wasn't great so stuck to a safe choice). One was served on a children's plate (!!), and both servings looked so disgusting that we didn't even eat them. A lady was having the chicken burger - well, quite frankly the meat looked nothing like you would expect, and possibly a dog may eat it. Service appalling there too.

Waves Bar - thank god for that place. Food still pretty average but edible so that was nice! Mohamed and the younger Mohamed were both AMAZING! Attentive, polite and really good at their jobs.

We told Mohamed about our experience at the Pyramid bar and he offered us a meal at the Blue Ginger restaurant that evening.

The Blue Ginger - AMAZING! The food was spot on - tasty and flavoursome. Service - well, you get the 2 Mohamed's again - so a lovely evening there.

Hotel in general - the place is quite dirty. Definitely not 5*. After complaining the result was hilarious - the lazy (as in, they just sat around all day!) pool staff were suddenly jet washing around the main pool area, they had a couple of men attempting to clean the green scum from the edges of the lazy river (SO glad my children weren't with us as they would've caught something if they went swimming round in it all day!). The manager had taken on board a few things which we had all said. The food in the normal restaurant isn't enticing whatsoever.

Taxi 10 minutes away into Nama Bay cost £10 return. Nice to get out and experience some atmosphere as severely lacking at the hotel.

All in all - I would not recommend this hotel. If you go, I'm sure you would have a lovely time, but just lower your expectations and then you might not be disappointed.

I would suggest whether or not hotel competitors charge guests for fresh orange juice, maybe they should reconsider this for English guests? Mini bar/fridge in room, again, reconsider this, stop cutting costs, and offer English guests a restocked daily fridge and more than 2 bottles of water in the room. It's sometimes the little things that do make a difference. The all inclusive, ultra all inclusive, club inclusive, Royal club inclusive - it's all too confusing!

We did have a giggle as even when we were there, we still couldn't really work out the packages on offer!

Amazing!,"Beautiful location. Food did not disappoint one bit. Lovely cocktails too!
The pizzas are amazing. Good atmosphere.

Lovely holiday and perfect for the children!,"Family of 5, children aged 8, 9 and 11.

Lots to keep them amused. Table tennis, football, archery, rock climbing, water slides, endless ice creams and making new friends!
Kids clubs were good (which is where they did most of the activities). Only really used them in the morning for a couple of hours while we could disappear to the adult infinity pool for some sophistication!

Gripes but not major: bottles of water never cold in the various fridges around the resort, wine never cold (!), could do without music at the children's paradise, bar staff at pavilion not that friendly, breakfast fresh orange juice a real effort as manual machine so have to cut own oranges and then squeeze them in a stupid contraption! Not worth the effort for the time it takes to drink it!!

Take sea/beach shoes for the stones.

You can pay for things at the hotel in euros or Turkish lira.

Highly recommend the water sport activities. Tanner (banana man!) was lovely and looked after the kids so well. Highlight of the holiday and worth the money: a morning for the kids of parasailing, jet skiing, banana ride, ringo. €70 per child.
Highly recommend speed boat taxi (also organised by Tanner) to Blue Lagoon. Just a nicer way to get there than a taxi.

Fabulous holiday. The kids would say the best so far! Not quite 5 star for me personally, but of course with all these reviews, you don't know the standard of person writing them!",Date of stay: July 2014,Liberty Hotels Lykia,1,"Oludeniz, Turkey"
Do you have interconnecting rooms please?,"We are wanting to book for the end of July.
Does your hotel have interconnecting rooms? We are a family of 5.
Or what rooms can you offer for a family of 5?
I look forward to hearing your reply.
Thank you very much!",Date of stay: June 2014,Voyage Torba,1,"Torba, Turkey"
Thank goodness for the people I was with!,"Oh, no option for 'no star' that's a shame!
Just returned from a rugby tour and during the whole weekend at brean sands I kept expecting Jeremy Kyle to pop out at any moment.
Cleanliness sucks.
Food - powdered eggs, fried bread tasted of turkey nuggets clearly cooked in the same oil. There was more food under the servery than on it!
They kept asking our children to get off the stage due to health and safety but the rest of the grounds clearly hadn't had a H&S check for years.
I wasn't alone in my thoughts on our stay here and watch this space for the rest of the rugby tour group reviews. We thought we weren't snobs, but clearly we are! Don't waste you're money unless you're with a rugby tour group of 250 people!",Date of stay: March 2014,Pontins Brean Sands Holiday Park,1,"Burnham-On-Sea, United Kingdom"
Friendly and lovely food - free transport to and from your hotel!,"We went to la scala last night and really enjoyed it!
Staff were more helpful than in our hotel!
Food is reasonably priced, a little bit less than you'd pay for in the UK.
We got a taxi there and when we arrived we saw their car with sign writing on saying 'free transport from your hotel'.
So big tip is to ask the concierge from your hotel to call la scala for you. The taxi doesn't cost much anyway, but you feel in safer hands!
Lively place to eat. We will go again this week!",,La Scala,1,"Agadir, Morocco"
