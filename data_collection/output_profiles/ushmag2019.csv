Amazing,"Not even kidding but the food was one of the best Indian meals I have ever had. We had the butter prawns curry with rice and garlic naan and kebabs for starters. The food was fresh and full of flavours. We had issue paying by card,but the staff were ever so helpful the most pleasant service was offered. Definitely will be going back when am there again.",Date of visit: November 2019,Tandoori Flames,5,"Quarteira, Portugal"
