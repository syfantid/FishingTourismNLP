Unforgettable Experience,"Wow! What an incredible experience this was! Antonia and Michalis are wonderful, friendly people and they truly make you feel like family. Everything in the description is accurate and it’s worth your time and money! From helping with the catch, enjoying the ride on open water, eating a fabulous meal, swimming in a secluded area, to laughing and chatting, it’s truly magical. I hope to visit Kefalonia again so I can book this trip! Don’t hesitate! Book now!",Date of experience: September 2020,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
