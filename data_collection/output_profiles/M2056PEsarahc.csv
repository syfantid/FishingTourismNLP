Fabulous lunch,"Just go - it’s perfect. Lovely garden setting, beautiful flower gazebo. Food and service excellent. Slight breeze in the trees and above the beach so fab view.",Date of visit: June 2019,Captain Nicolas,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
A taste of Greece,"A relaxing day with great people and a real taste of Greece. Fishing on the boat, releasing the fish from the nets and then our captain cooked the catch for us whilst we lay on a secluded beach! Turtles and a bit of snorkelling too. The food was amazing, fresh & tasty. Nothing too much trouble. You have to try this, more personal, very traditional and we learnt something too. Thank you Maria and Captain - we loved it!",Date of experience: June 2019,Poseidon Fishing Tourism Kefalonia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fab food & fun,Visited for an early evening meal with husband. Loved the decor and tried lots of different dishes followed by a dramatic “Garden for her”. Great fun and would defo recommend. Harry our server was friendly and not intrusive. We also didn’t feel rushed as we have in other restaurants early doors. A very enjoyable evening.,Date of visit: May 2019,Victors,4,"Alderley Edge, United Kingdom"
