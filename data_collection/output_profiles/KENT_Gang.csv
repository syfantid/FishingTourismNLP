The best of trips with super-friendly hosts. 100% recommended,"This was definitely the highlight of our wonderful fortnight in beautiful Kefalonia. We had the best of days; watching the fishing nets being recovered (and the myriad of different, and as we found out, tasty species), seeing the sea turtles around the fish farm, swimming and snorkelling at the White Cliffs beach and Vardiani Island (both only accessible by boat), and eating the finest of freshly caught and prepared food, all washed down with local wine and tsipouro. Maria and Captain Gerasimos were so friendly and welcoming, explaining how the food was prepared, and taking time to answer all of the questions we had about Kefalonian life. We also had the delights of Maria's very friendly young daughter to entertain us. We are a family of four including two adult, 18 and 20 year old daughters, who all thoroughly enjoyed our fabulous trip.",Date of experience: August 2020,Poseidon Fishing Tourism Kefalonia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic seafood,"Our first evening in Kefalonia saw us venture down to Xi Beach to Nisoi Vardinoi. We were seated at the front edge of the terrace, with stunning views across the beach to Vardiano. The service was good, if lacking a smile and being rather brusque. We started with cheese on fire (the theatre of flaming cheese was fabulous), peppers stuffed with feta, feta and honey and hummus and pitta. All four starters were lovely. As were the mains; Shrimp Sagnaki with ouzo, Fisherman's Pasta, Fisherman's Rice and Shrimp Pasta. We were not able to face a pudding but a lovely touch was the complimentary Greek yoghurt and fig jam to cleanse our pallette. A lovely experience.",Date of visit: August 2020,Nisoi Vardianoi Estiatorio Mezedopoleio,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great food and drink with super-friendly service,"Our rental car satnav took us on a tortuous journey along roads that barely existed to get to Ladokolla Stin Plagia. All we can say is that it was worth the effort. Why? The setting is superb overlooking the beautiful Ionian Sea where the sun was to set whilst we enjoyed the food. The food - was out of this world; We had wonderful salads, freshly baked bread and grilled cheese with marmalade to start. Exquisite. We then had a variety of mains which again were of the highest quality - oven-baked chicken, local spicy sausages and Kefalonian meat pie. All followed by honey and sesame seed doughnuts, which we had to make room for! But to top everything off, the service was so friendly. We were made to feel welcome from the off, with everyone going out of their way to offer smiles, advice about what to eat and to discuss the history of a mutual interest: Manchester United. I will keep my promise to think about the lovely people in this wonderful corner of Kefalonia, drinking a glass of Greek red wine whilst watching the Red Devils play in the Champions League next season and hopefully beyond.",Date of visit: August 2020,Ladokolla Stin Plagia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great way to start our holiday,"Due to coronavirus fears, we booked into the Escape Lounge prior to flying to Kefalonia, hoping for more space and a safer environment.
We were not disappointed. We were quickly checked in, seated at a reserved table and provided with good quality food albeit from a limited choice. Portion sizes were good. Drinks were refilled promptly.
Lovely staff especially Val.
We would definitely use it again.",Date of experience: August 2020,Escape Lounge,4,"Stansted Mountfitchet, United Kingdom"
18th Birthday Celebration,"We have been keen to visit the Ale House Kitchen since it opened so were delighted when our youngest daughter chose it for her birthday meal last night. There were six of us and we are all delighted with our visit. The decor, drinks selection, and general ambience was spot on. The food options offered are good and the quality when prepared is excellent. And finally, the service; the two young ladies who waited on our table were friendly and attentive. We thoroughly recommend the Ale House Kitchen and will return soon.",Date of visit: January 2019,The Ale House Kitchen,4,"Ramsey, United Kingdom"
"Outstanding Fayre, Wonderful Service","We were looking to find somewhere pleasant to eat whilst our daughters attended a concert by All Time Low at the nearby Alexandra Palace. A 20 minute walk through a snow blizzard saw us arrive at Tomo where we were made to feel really welcome from the off.

The restaurant is not big but the tables are set so you are not on top of people at neighbouring tables. We would recommend booking as there was not a free table, which is to be expected on a Saturday evening.

The food was delicious - we started with antipasti which was a wonderful mix of flavours and textures. My wife ordered the special pizza, unusually with smoked salmon as a topping. It looked, and she said, tasted wonderful. I had the meat calzone and was presented with a huge pizza which was divine. The base of the pizzas were wonderful and light.

The wine and beer selection was excellent too. Owing to the portion sizes we did not have any appetite for pudding but they looked lovely. I just about managed an lovely affogato and my wife a cognac.

So, I apologise in advance for the play on words but, whilst our daughters were enjoying All Time Low, we were very much having an All Time High at Tomo! A lovely restaurant, wonderful service and truly magnificent food which we unreservedly recommended.",Date of visit: March 2018,Tomo Pizzeria & Restaurant,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Great Pizza,"We arrived in Davenport after a long journey from the United Kingdom armed with recommendations aplenty. One place which came highly recommended was Mia Pizza and we were not disappointed. As soon as we had emptied the hire car of luggage and pointed the four teenagers in our party towards the lovely pool, we headed off to Mia for, unsurprisingly, pizza!

The pizzas, as you would expect, were freshly cooked to order, not quickly but not the wait was not too long either. They tasted sublime washed down by a couple of cool Buds (obtained from Publix next door) sat by the pool to start our holiday off the right way.

The service was friendly and efficient and the pizza was very good value for money. We will go back to Mia Pizza on our next visit to Orlando.",Date of visit: May 2015,MIA Pizza,4,"Davenport, Florida"
Superb Restaurant Found Completely By Chance,"My family and I (ages ranging from 12 - 69) happened across this restaurant in late October 2013, much like the previous reviewer, completely by accident. We are very pleased that we did. The restaurant itself is well decorated and we were greeted by a very friendly host. The salad bar was well stocked with fresh, tasty produce and the main meal was served reasonably promptly. Having eaten at similar restaurants (in Bruggen and Hardt) the standard had been set high but the Croatia Restaurant did not fail to deliver.

The food and service was outstanding and we were made to feel very welcome. My attempts to converse in (limited) German also appeared to be welcomed.

Overall I would whole-heartedly recommend Restaurant Craotia to anyone staying in or visiting the area. We will certainly be back.

I have only marked the atmosphere as 4/5 as there was only one other table in use when we visited.",Date of visit: October 2013,Restaurant Croatia,4,"Heinsberg, Germany"
"Best Greek Food Ever, Anywhere!","We had an overnight stay in Luxembourg City in the Summer and were fortunate to find the Restaurant Grec Athena. What a find! The service was brilliant with the hosts speaking English to a high standard.

Once seated at our comfortable table in a large dining area we were served reasonably priced drinks. The menu offered a wide choice.

The food was fantastic - my wife and I selected the Kleftiko which was exceptional. I am fortunate to have been to Greece and Cyprus with the food served at the Grec Athena rivalling anything from the East Mediterranean. Our daughters chose one of the Assiettes each and, too, were not disappointed.

In short, if you find yourself in Luxembourg, you MUST visit the Grec Athena - you will not be disappointed. I would estimate that it was a 10 minute walk from the City centre.",Date of visit: August 2013,Athena Restaurant Grec,4,"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg"
Fantastic Accomodation and Location,"We spent a wonderful 13 nights at the Holbinger Alm in August 2013.

Apartment - The apartment (Unterberg) is on the first floor with a large balcony affording stunning views across to the mountains bordering Austria. It was immaculately clean with plentiful supplies of laundry. The bedrooms were light and airy with insect-proof nets allowing windows to be left open. The kitchen was very well stocked which could only be improved by a combi-oven/oven instead of the microwave. The lounge was well furnished with a TV offering a large number of channels, including a couple of English news channels.

Location - Superbly located allowing easy access to Berchtesgaden, Salzburg, Bad Reichenhall, Munich/Dachau and wider Bavaria. We visited Schloss Neuschwanstein, Schloss Linderhoff and Schloss Herrenchiemsee as well as a trip around the Austrian Tirol. Ample free parking is available.

Host - Krista was a fantastic host offering advice and regular changes of linen (and sweets/chocolate!) She kindly offers a service to stock your apartment with food and drink ready for your arrival. This was very welcome for us as we arrived on a Sunday which finds all supermarkets in Germany and Austria closed.

Value - Amazing value for money. We would love to visit again.",Date of stay: August 2013,Hoelbinger Alm,4,"Anger, Germany"
Cyprus in Peterborough,"This was our second visit to Salamis, the first being on a Sunday afternoon where there was only one other couple in the restaurant. The quality of the food and service was not, therefore, matched, on that visit, by the ambience.

A visit on a Saturday evening found the restaurant full, an indication of its popularity.

So why so popular? We all (5 of us) opted for the Meze (with mussels and giant prawns) and were not disappointed. The food ranged from dips, salad, pitta, prawns, melon and mushrooms through to king prawns, fish, calamari, fried potatoes and meatballs. This was followed by stifado, afelia, dolmades, mixed grilled kebab and rice, finishing with a fantastically refreshing fresh fruit salad.

The food was exceptional and the service was friendly and efficient. Our group of five contained two young people and the waiter accurately assessed that Meze for four would suffice. He was spot on and there was ample food to satisfy our healthy appetites.

We cannot recommend Salamis enough. Wash your food down with Keo beers and wines to complete the Cypriot experience.",Date of visit: April 2013,Salamis Taverna,4,"Peterborough, United Kingdom"
A Fantastic Base for Exploring the Area,"We have just returned from a week long half-term trip to Vakantiepark 't Posterbos which is conveniently located between the towns of Roermond (Holland) and Heinsberg (Germany) -

Booking/Pre-arrival - We used Booking.com to book and found their website very easy to use. Vakantiepark 't Posterbos' website is also available in English which proved useful. Despite the Booking.com website stating that Posterbos are happy to receive cash on arrival, our booking confirmation came with a demand that the balance be paid by a set date by cheque (as Credit cards are not accepted) If you do use this method to book, please disregard this as they do not in fact take cheques either! So my phone calls to my bank and subsequent visit were in vain as a phone call to the park sorted the cash/cheque issue. It also saved me £25 which my bank wanted to charge for raising a cheque in Euros....

I contacted Posterbos by email the day prior to our trip to enquire about linen/towels and the arrival procedure. A quick response was received to say that we could bring our own linen/towels or hire from the Park. We elected to take our own so cannot comment on the quality of those provided. With regards to the arrival and collection of the key / site access card, as our planned arrival time of 3pm on a Saturday afternoon fell outside of normal reception hours we were given a code for a safe and clear instructions.

Arrival - We arrived just after 3.30pm and duly located the safes as per the emailled instructions. In the safe were a set of keys, a map of the park and a entry card for the vehicle barriers. The map was easy to follow and very soon we were parked on the driveway of our two-storey bungalow!

The Bungalow - We found the bungalow to be very clean. It had a well-equipped kitchen/diner - fridge (no freezer compartment), microwave, gas hob, combination microwave/grill oven, coffee machine, a dishwasher, a plentiful array of cutlery/pans/crockery and a dining table/chairs. The lounge was spacious with a leather 3-piece suite, sideboard, unit and a large flat-screen TV (which was able to receive BBC1) Also downstairs was a double bedroom (2 x Twins pushed together/2 x single duvets/2 x pillows) with bedisde units and a wardrobe, a toilet and a bathroom which had a shower over the bath. In addition was a storeroom, where there was a iron, ironing board and airer. This room was ideal for storing our roofbox for the week too. Up the steep stairs found two sparsely decorated/furnished large bedrooms each with two single beds in them, a wardrobe and bedside tables. Lighting was not briliiant in the bungalow with low-wattage bulbs appearing to be the order of the day.

The cost of the rental included the gas and electric. The first night at Posterbos saw the temperatures reach -5c but the heating made light work of keeping us warm and cosy.

The Park - October/November is probably not the peak period for Posterbos but there were still plenty of people around. The neighbouring complex, Landal, is happy to welcome guests to their bowling alley and restaurant bar. We did not frequent this but the menu looked appealing and the alley/bar looked good. There is an outdoor swimming pool that will be open dependent upon the season visited in. WIFI is available for 15 Euros per week.

We visited the reception on the Monday morning and spoke to the very friendly staff there. They took our cash and an 80 Euro deposit, which was returned at the end of our breakage-free visit. Whilst at the reception we mentioned that the kitchen light was not working - it was fixed by our return later in the day.

Location - Roermond is a fifteen minute drive away and its Designer Outlet Village too. Heinsberg is a twenty minute drive over the border into Germany. In nearby Posterholt and St Odilienberg and in Karken (Germany) there are numerous supermarkets, restaurants, pharmacies and bars. These are all within a 5-10 minute drive from Posterbos.

Whilst staying at Posterbos, we also visited Amsterdam (2 hour drive to the Amsterdam Arena Park and Ride which was only 8 Euros for up to five people), Koln (70 minute drive to the Haus Vort Park and Ride which was only 11.10 Euros for up to five people), Phantasialand Theme Park (1 hour drive), The Ardennes (75 minute drive) and Monchengladbach which was a 35 minute drive.

Verdict - We had a fantastic week using Posterbos as a base for visiting nearby towns, cities, areas, shops, restaurants and attractions. In summer, I can imagine a bustling, busy park with an outdoor swimming pool and fantastic walking/cycling opportunities. The bungalow we stayed in was perfectly fit for purpose albeit a touch dated. The bottom line is that we would not hesitate to use Vakantiepark 't Posterbos again in the future.",Date of stay: October 2012,Vakantiepark 't Posterbos,4,"Posterholt, The Netherlands"
A Wonderful Week on board Sir Bruin,"This is our second holiday booked with Countrywide Cruisers having been fortunate enough to hire Sir Galleron in October 2007. Both times we have found the quality of the hire boats to be second to none. Having hired a boat from Alvechurch Boat Centres (UK Boat Hire) in October 2009 we must say that Countrywide Cruisers' boats are of a much better quality.

To address the issue of (allegedly) unhelpful staff I must say that things were greatly improved on our latest visit. Steve couldn't have been more helpful and spent an appropriate amount of time to ensure we knew what to do with regards to the boat controls, daily checks and who to contact in the event of an emergency. Certainly an improvement on the welcome we received in 2007.

Sir Bruin is a lovely boat (as is Sir Galleron) with the most fantastic showers, comfortable beds, efficient central heating system (not that we needed it much last week!) and a pleasure to 'drive'. None of our family are particularly tall and all found the beds adequate and comfortable.

All-in-all we had a fantastic week navigating the many locks of the Stourport Ring and the beautiful River Severn.

If narrowboating is your thing then you can't go far wrong with hiring a boat from this small, friendly company.",Date of stay: May 2011,Countrywide Cruisers,4,"Brewood, United Kingdom"
Excellent food and Service,"We visited Jimmy Spice's whilst on a narrowboat holiday through The Midlands.

Firstly the service was first class with the whole party made to feel very welcome - our ages ranged from 10 to 67.

The food was very good with an excellent choice. Especially good was the chinese fayre which was freshly prepared for you by a wok-wielding chef!

The drinks were reasonably priced and when a jug of water was requested, this was delivered very promptly.

Finally the price - spot on. With drinks, the bill came to £15 per head which included a gratuity.

All in all a very pleasant experience - very noisy and bustling which we all enjoyed.",Date of visit: May 2011,Jimmy Spice's,4,"Birmingham, United Kingdom"
A Hidden Gem,"We visited this lovely restaurant twice during our stay in Miami Platja in July 2009. The food was exemplary, just what one would expect from a German-style restaurant. Generous portions of well-prepared food was served by very friendly staff who, in addition to German, spoke very good English.

The restaurant does not have the best of views from its covered patio but the food, drinks and service made up for it - ideal for trainspotters though as the rail line runs just across the road!

We will definitely be back there when we return to the area in 2011.",,Can Claus,4,"Miami Platja, Spain"
