Fishing trip,I would reccomend this to anyone even if they have never fished before. The fishing the food the swim in the sea deserve 5 stars the captain is amazing and the food he cooked on board was chicken and all the fish we had caught was 5 stars,Date of experience: May 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
Food,This is an amazing place to eat the food is amazing and family friendly the people are so welcoming the potions are great and very good prices beautifully fresh cooked to order. Believe me we will be visiting this place before returning home. The picture certainly doesn't do this food justice. Chicken breast with mushrooms.,Date of visit: May 2019,Yiannis Grill House,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
