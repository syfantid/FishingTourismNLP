Fantastic family day out,"We were in Kefalonia for 2 weeks with our 4 teenage kids. For our second week we rented a villa just outside Skala and were looking for some activities to keep everyone happy. I stumbled upon Dimitrios and Efi's fishing trip on TripAdvisor, and wasn't really sure - it was quite expensive, would the kids enjoy it, all day, what if someone wanted to get off the boat, what if we were travel sick, would there be life jackets?!! In the end we went for it and i'm so glad we did!! To see the kids actually enjoying finding the different fish in the nets and un-ravelling them, to experience the wonderful Greek hospitality of our hosts - it is too much to write! The life jackets were excellent quality, although not really needed. Nobody was travel sick and the water was very calm. One of the stops involved visiting a natural mud pool which everyone enjoyed, especially the girls - a freebie beauty treatment thrown in! And the day we visited we had the great good fortune to land on a beach in time to watch the ocean turtle eggs hatching - a fantastic experience. And then there was the food!!! A thoroughly enjoyable meal, with the pleasurable company of our hosts and one other family aboard - the freshest fish I've ever eaten, accompanied by wonderful local Greek produce from Efi's own garden, and homemade wine. I thought the day might drag, but in the end everyone was surprised and disappointed when we realised we were heading back for land. A really great experience, I would recommend to anyone - really was money well spent.

Real Greek Adventure Holiday,"A long, long time ago - pre-children - I spent a couple of years on a traditional Greek island as an English teacher. Now a single parent with 3 kids (aged 9 to 13) I wanted their first taste of Greece to be authentic and fun. Pete managed to provide both of these elements. All I had to do was sort out the flights - he arranged every detail of our holiday from the itinerary (varied, with both culture and adventure) and accommodation (Villa Nafkrati - see separate Trip Advisor entry), transport, all activities - everything in fact. We are quite a challenging family and I couldn't have hoped for a more attentive and caring host. We all had a fantastic time - with activities ranging from trips to the farm to visit the goats, pigs, geese, hens, rabbits, to mountain biking, kayaking, hiking, visits to local winery to learn about the ancient wine production on the island, trips to ancient sites, swimming in beautiful seas...... And of course, lots of Greek food and drink. We timed our trip to coincide with Orthodox Easter, and Peter made sure we managed to see the local religious festivals - even picking us up at 11pm one evening to take us to the church service. Couldn't have hoped for a better holiday, and I'm sure we will be back. One other point worth mentioning is that I was surprised at the level of attention to health and safety - not something I was really expecting on a Greek island - but all activities were well managed with fully appropriate safety equipment, and I was very happy to let my children take part in all of the activities.",Date of experience: April 2015,Island Ikaria Activity Tours,5,"Ikaria, Greece"
Great language school,"I stayed here for one week in April. I normally go on holiday with friends, but this time everyone else was skint, so I decided to go on my own. I thought the structure of a couple of hours of planned activity each day would be good, so booked a week at the school. What great luck! I had a fantastic week. Firstly, all the teachers I came across were great. They all seemed well motivated, interested in their students, and interested in teaching us stuff. The administrators in the office were a great help at sorting out any problems you had, not just to do with the school, but generally helping with working out how to book travel etc. Really friendly atmosphere. The cultural programme was also excellent, and a great way to get to know new people. I took the option of staying in accommodation run by one of the teachers at the school, Jose Luis, which was also a good move. Overall I spent a great week in Granada, saw a lot of the town, met a lot of people, and improved my Spanish significantly. On return to the UK to continue my weekly lessons at the Cervantes Institute in Leeds I can see a real difference.

Warm welcome in a fantastic location,"Don't bother staying in Liverpool city centre, stay here, just over the river, in a small town full of charm and activities. Great public transport in the whole area - good, regular train service and bus service, you have easy access to all of the shops, restaurants and museums in Liverpool city centre (and there are lots of them in this vibrant city) as well as the attractions of New Brighton - golf, pitch and put, miniature golf, walks along the promenade, crabbing on the beach, ten pin bowling, amusement arcades and rides, and lots of lovely fresh sea air. Great full English breakfast to start your day off, too!!",Date of stay: May 2013,Albion Guest House,5,"New Brighton, United Kingdom"
Fun for ages!,Good old fashioned clean fun. A bit competitive. A bit of banter. Enjoyed by whole party from Grandad aged 88 to youngest aged 8.,Date of experience: October 2013,Championship Adventure Golf,5,"New Brighton, United Kingdom"
Full of charm,"If you want modern glitz and top of the range fittings, this is not for you. If you can handle charm from the minute you set foot through the door, keep reading. I arrived late and tired for a one-night stop over on my way to Normandy, choosing the hotel purely for location. The hotel receptionist was wonderful, chatty, charming, knowledgeable. He checked SNCF to ensure I had the right time and station for my departure the next morning and despatched me off to a lovely restaurant at the top of the street for a beautiful dinner. My bedroom was small and strangely shaped, but this is Paris. The en suite was also small and strangely shaped, but clean. Although some of the fittings are perhaps a little tired, the hotel has been very sympathetically renovated, with beautiful spiral staircase down to a lovely breakfast room on the lower floor with vaulted stone ceilings. I would definitely choose to stay here again.",Date of stay: August 2013,Hotel France Albion,5,"Paris, France"
"Excellent service, great views of the Acropolis","We were greeted by a friendly, well-informed, helpful, multilingual receptionist. The room was clean and comfortable, the en suite small but perfectly acceptable. Although the view from our room was not great (view of the building directly opposite, on the side street), once we got up to the rooftop bar we were greeted with the best views of the acropolis I have ever seen - absolutely stunning. The breakfast was also good, and we were able to get something to eat and drink even though we had to leave the hotel at 6am. We originally booked purely on grounds of location, as the hotel is at Monistiraki metro station (direct line from the airport; also direct line to Pireaus for ferries). But the hotel offers much more.",Date of stay: April 2013,Plaka Hotel,5,"Athens, Greece"
