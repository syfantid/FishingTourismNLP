We discovered the extraordinary sea caves of kleftiko and swim in their unrealistic blue sea, had lunch in a magical place with fish we had just caught and other delicious Greek food. Just to name a few memorable moments on this unforgettable day. Most of all, we were so well received by the captain and his family who welcomed us as guests and moved us with their kindness. If you want to experience Milos as it bests, Milos Fishing tour is a must!  Exp√©rience unique et magique. Nous avons √©t√© chaleureusement re√ßu sur le bateau ¬´¬†Milos FishingTrip¬†¬ª pour toute une journ√©e. Nous avons d√©couvert les caves extraordinaires de Kleftiko, avons nag√© dans une mer d‚Äôun bleu irr√©el et avons d√©jeun√© sur le bateau au milieu des caves des poissons que nous venions de p√™cher. De plus, l‚Äôaccueil du capitaine et de sa famille √©tait d‚Äôune g√©n√©rosit√© et d‚Äôune gentillesse qui ont ajout√© du bonheur √† cette journ√©e. Si vous allez √† Milos, vous devez absolument faire ce tour‚Ä¶"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/329katerinac,August 2020,5,Amazing and Authentic Experience ,"Captain Kyriakos is an authentic man and very joyful person and his daughter Tina was very kind.They are both very friendly and full of humor!! We went for fishing and caught many fishes!! Mr Kyriakos and his daughter Tina cooked the fishes and other tradiniotal greek dishes. They also provided delicious breakfast and fruits! The trip and the beaches we visited were amazing (Gerakas, Tsigkardo, Kleftiko) . The fishing trip is for maximum 10 persons therefore i suggest to book 2-3 days before. The most amazing and authentic experience!! Thank you so much Captain and Tina!‚Ä¶"

We caught so many fish that we shared some of our catch with another fishing tour so that they could eat lunch.   The fish were delicious, and the captain and his daughter were excellent hosts and guides!

4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/882vikyp,November 2019,5,A Story of friendship !,"We arrived very early (4:50 am) in Milos port, no accomodation booked til then, no idea what should we do at this time, out from the ferryboat. First person we met in the habour was Kiriakos, the fisherman and his family on his boat Anna-Maria and he sold to us fresh fish!! We left at the end of November for a season end getaway. On top of that! If Kiriakos and his family had not been, we would probably have left the island of Milos again....  Kiriakos not only showed us the island with his big boat, but also provided us with fresh fish and salads on his boat for 4 days, as family. We heard very great and interesting stories and laughed a lot. We came as strangers and we left as friends. We thank you very much, Tina, Anna, Anna Maria and Kiriakos for this great time and that you have been there for us. You really saved our holiday!  Of cause you can stay in Winter on Milos, with fishingtrips and alot of good food with Kiriakos and family !  See you again, either back on Milos or in Crete!  Love Vaggeli, Ari and Biky‚Ä¶"
