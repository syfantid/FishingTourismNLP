Great atmosphere at the water front,We were here on our first Night in Milos and got a great table write by the water front and could watch the fish swimming next to our table. Our kids wanted fresh lemonade and although it was not on the menu they just made it and it was very tasty! Had great seafood pasta.,Date of visit: August 2019,mikros Apoplous,4,"Milos, Greece"
"Great fishing, snorkeling and lunch","We are a family with 3 kids age 5, 12 and 15 and we wanted to combine a sailing trip with fishing. This was absolutely perfect. Tina was very considerate about picking the best day for us (with the least wind). All kids caught a fish and loved the delicious lunch. We were only a total of 11 guests on the boat and that made it much more fun and personal and well worth the extra money rather than the crowded big groups. Another highlight was the sight of two dolphins swimming right in front of the boat. I highly recommend this trip!",Date of experience: August 2019,Milos Fishing Trip,4,"Milos, Greece"
A home in nature,"We travelled with our 3 kids (4, 11, 14) and stayed here for 2 nights. We loved the calm beauty of the place. As soon as we arrived in the reception we were welcomed by the most gentle guy who immidiately made us reel very comfortable and welcome. We stayed in cabin 4 with plenty of room for us and good internet. We tried out all the little trails at the hotel and were lucky to see an armadillo very close up. There is a bakery and several good restaurants within walking distance.",Date of stay: May 2018,Los Pinos - Cabanas y Jardines,4,"Cerro Plano, Costa Rica"
A nice family day,"We came here for a day trip with our 3 kids (4, 11, 14). There were not a lot of people and the guides were very friendly and willing to fit the activities to our plans. As a positive surprise we ended up first doing the canoing on the river all 5 and hereafter the horsebackride all 5 together. Our youngest son of 4 went with a guide on both trips. We had a great lunch at the restaurant and hereafter relaxed in the many natural hot pools and waterfalls and the river. It was a great day!",Date of experience: April 2018,Club Rio Outdoor Center,4,"La Fortuna de San Carlos, Costa Rica"
Great family vacation planned by My Costa Rica,"My Costa Rica planned a 14 day family vacation (3 kids aged 4, 11 and 14) for us travelling from San José to Arenal to Monteverde to Manuel Antonio to the Osa Peninsula and back to San José from end April to mid May. We had a fantastic time and were so impressed with all the country had to offer and a plan that was on time - every time. We were happy that we ended up travelling at this time rather than at Easter as we had the impression that there were less tourists and thereby less traffic and less people so we always felt that there was good time for us and we could have it the way that it fit us best which is an advantage when you travel with three kids. The drivers and guides were all very prompt and we felt safe in their hands.

We were very satisfied with the hotels selected. We particularly loved the Cabanas los Pinos and Drake Bay Wilderness Resort where staff was wonderful and made us feel very welcome and at home. However, Costa Verde in Manuel Antonio Bungalow A14 we would not recommend to use again. We liked the idea of having a bungalow with rooms for the whole family, but one room was very small (just big enough to fit a single bed and a huge and noisy fan) and it did not have any windows only net so the room was very hot, humid and noisy. You could off course hear the sounds of the sourrounding forest but worse you could also hear the traffic from the nearby road and a lot of loud music from the nearby restaurant and Night club El Avion which continued to very late Night (we were there both Friday and Saturday!).

The contact with My CostaRica has been very prompt and professional. One thing to improve would be the communication about our flight from Drake Bay to San José - it seemed strange that they did not inform us that the AirPort at Drake Bay was closed and we had to use La Palma Sur instead even though when talking to the locals it was clear that the AirPort had been closed at Drake Bay for some time and that we had to contact the agency for updated details when it would be more appropriate that it had happened the other way around.

That said we had a fantastic and well planned vacation - one of the best ever!",Date of experience: April 2018,My Costa Rica,4,"San Jose, Costa Rica"
Beautiful shop,"Lots of local art and the money goes directly to the local people producing the artwork, very good service in the shop.",Date of experience: April 2018,Galeria Namu,4,"San Jose, Costa Rica"
Do not stay in bungalow A14 if you are more than 4 persons!,"We were a family of two adults and three kids (4, 11 and 14) staying for 3 nights at Costa Verde in Manuel Antonio Bungalow A14 and we would not recommend to stay here. We liked the idea of having a bungalow with rooms for the whole family, but one room was very small (just big enough to fit a single bed and a huge and noisy fan) and it did not have any windows only net so the room was very hot, humid and noisy. You could off course hear the sounds of the sourrounding forest but worse you could also hear the traffic from the nearby road and a lot of loud music from the nearby restaurant and Night club El Avion which continued to very late at Night (we were there both Friday and Saturday!). The bungalow was far from the hotel pools so we never used these and to go to the beach we had to take a local bus (which was easy when we found out how). Good things were the fantastic ocean view from the terrace that we enjoyed every morning while also having fun looking at all the monkeys passing and the great bakery very close to the bungalow where we bought breakfast every morning.",Date of stay: May 2018,Hotel Costa Verde,4,"Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica"
Tropical Paradise,"We were a family staying here for 3 nights with 3 kids (4, 11, 14). We had a room for give but the Resort immidiately offered us to also use the neighbour room free of charge which our oldest kids really appreciated. The rooms had a fantastic ocean view and we saw of wildlife on the beautiful grounds of the hotel. There is a free laundry service which we used every day. We loved the pool area around the bar relaxing every afternoon after the tours. The hotel also offers to use their kayaks which our oldest son and his father did and saw crocodiles in the river next to the kayak! The food offered included was really great as well. We wished we could have stayed longer!",Date of stay: May 2018,Drake Bay Wilderness Resort,4,"Drake Bay, Costa Rica"
