He’s brilliant, patient and great with kids. We had a lovely time and caught lots of fish. Had to throw back a fair few small ones but you can eat the big ones and they will arrange them to be cooked for you after the trip. Thanks!!"

0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsGoffer,November 2016,5,Fishing Adventure,"My husband and I saved this excursion for the last day on our four day trip. We booked through the faliraki beach activities booth.  35€ and we were picked up at the beach by Sergio, at 12:00. The fishing vessel was an authentic fisherman's boat,  large enough for probably 8-10 people to fish comfortably.  We however were very lucky and had the boat to ourselves . Sergio was a friendly local fisherman with the patience and know how, to help us remember how to fish.  The last time we fished was over ten years ago so we were a little rusty.  Sergio helped us prepare bait,  untangle our lines,  and give us tips and tricks for success.  We spent over 3 hours in a few different spots and wound up catching a bunch of fish! (See our final catch in photo) Afterwards Sergio brought us to his friend's restaurant where they cooked our fish for free, we paid only for the salads and drinks . It was an incredibly authentic experience and it was the highlight of our trip.  My husband and are pretty relaxed and laid back people and this fishing trip was a relaxing, fun adventure that we will never forget. Thank you Sergio! "
