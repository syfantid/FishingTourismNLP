Date night to cheer us up.,"We've often passed this restaurant on our way to dine at a couple of their neighbours. Each time feeling intrigued and promising ourselves that we should give it a go one day. Well, that we did and we certainly didn't regret it. We were shown to our table down stairs into what we understood to have previously been their cocktail bar. So felt natural to order a couple before our meal. They arrived with a smile from our waitress, Emma. She was wearing a mask but we could see she was smiling underneath it!
We chose the Chorizo Scotch egg and the the Cannoli followed by Beef cheek Bolognese for me and the Roast Duck for my wife The food was absolutely delicious, especially enjoyed my scotch egg. Our sweet choices didn't disappoint either. The chocolate pot was to die for. My pannacotta was very good although I did struggle to taste the elder flower flavour in the pannacotta itself. We'll be back to try the rest of their menu for sure. Oh, great wine too! The California Merlot was a perfect match for our meals. Would try and book a table upstairs next time as seemed to have a different vibe which is fine.",Date of visit: October 2020,The Yard,4,"Chester, United Kingdom"
Amazing holiday enjoyed CV-19 or no CV-19!,"As a group of two couples, we were unsure of what to expect for obvious reasons. We were told that the hotel had only reopened three days prior to our arrival. Talk about a close shave! Imagine! We could easily have booked our holiday a little earlier in August. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel so welcomed and reassured in terms of all the CV-19 precautions in place for our safety. OK, so it's not the same all inclusive experience you may know and love but it's pretty close! The hotel itself is spotless. Our sea view hotel rooms were amazing with a mini bar fridge regularly re stocked. The staff work tirelessly to make your stay the best it can be in the circumstances and I feel that I must mention some names. Manolis and his team including Popi, Erika and Yannis are fantastic in the restaurant.(Limited choice but still tasty and improved as the week went on). All the staff at the pool restaurants (amazing food!) and both bars, especially Sofia. So bubbly and did a great job making sure our glasses were perpetually full! The maids are all friendly and do a great job too. There was no Chinese Restaurant option available during our stay. I suspect there is simply not enough customers to warrant opening it and stretching the available staff. The Italian restaurant was up and running and was very tasty the two occasions we booked in advance. So, in summary, if you are happy to endure wearing the face mask for the duration of your flight (please make sure you wear a mask for everyone's benefit), I can definitely say that it is worth the effort to visit this hotel and spend some quality time with the lovely people of Rhodes, Greece. Check out my other reviews for some ideas of what to do and where to eat.",Date of stay: August 2020,Mitsis Grand Hotel Beach Hotel,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Return visit.,"Having finally rediscovered this restaurant after our last visit many years ago, we were naturally very excited to experience what was, back then, a very tasty, fresh & home cooked menu. I'm pleased to report that in the main, it was as good as we remembered. The staff are all friendly and attentive. I had the freshest calamari starter followed by the Moussaka. It has to be said that the Moussaka was not quite as flavoursom as we remembered but very good nonetheless. It might just be our failing memory! We wish Hermes Restaurant all the very best for the future and we will be back again. Might even be sooner than 8 years.",Date of visit: September 2020,Hermes Restaurant,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
One day road trip to Lindos,This was the easiest experience I've ever had when hiring a car on the spur of the moment. There's no hidden costs. Everything covered by one charge. No worrying about excess costs in the event of an altercation. The clean and tidy Toyota Corolla Hybrid was delivered to our hotel bang on the agreed time of 9am by a very friendly chap. We signed the paper work and he explained that the fuel policy was full to full. I felt that the price was a little high for a one day rental but no real issue in view of the extra overhead costs they must have during these challengeing times. Not to mention the months of zero business they have also endured. Well done! We will be using your company next time we are in Rhodes.,Date of experience: September 2020,J&D Rent a Car,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Perfect location for a beer with a view.,Good beer at reasonable prices. We accidentally ordered large beers when we thought we were asking for the 0.5l size. We had a good laugh about it and drank them anyway. We have not tried their food although looks good.,Date of visit: September 2020,Fainos Restaurant,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Deliciousness with a warm welcome from the owner.,"Have you ever read some reviews and couldn't help but wonder if they are too good go be true? It's only human nature if you have. I know I have had my doubts when reading some Trip Advisor reviews. ""The proof is in the pudding"" so the old saying goes. Apart from the fact that we received a free ""pudding"", the proof was there on our plates, plentiful, delicious and very good value with the added warmth of Hermes' hospitality and attentive service. There are many places to choose from in Rhodes Old Town and most are probably as good as Hermes. Having said that, we were very pleased with our choice. I'd suspect that you will be too if you walk into this lovely family run establishment. You can guarantee that we'll be back when we return to Rhodes in the future. Thanks too for the unexpected golf buggy ride back towards our hotel. :)",Date of visit: September 2020,Hermes Greek Grill House,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Beautiful day out fishing & snorkeling with a delicious BBQ if a little windy!,"Makarounas is one of those little gems that you occasionally find while on holiday. Primarily, wanted to try some fishing. This trip certainly delivers plus lots more. The captain is very amenable, friendly and helpful, as is the lovely lady who assisted him. The grilled fish was delicious with a large portion of Greek Salad followed by a refreshing slice of water melon. The caves we visited are interesting and full of marine life. Be careful when swimming near the rocks. It's very easy to graze a knee or your back like I did . We took our own snorkeling equipment but you can borrow theirs if you're comfortable to do so. All in all a good day out which was lots of fun. Thanks!",Date of experience: August 2020,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Disappointing day fishing.,"Paid £72 for two of us to fish including hiring a boat for a full day. Then had to pay a further £6 for the hire of two life jackets (used to be free). You can bring your own if you have one. I get it that they probably have to deep clean the life jackets after each use. Nonetheless, still an unnecessary additional cost in respect of how much it costs to fish and hire a boat. Oh, they also charge £2.50 per car to park all day. All mounts up. The fishing was poor as well. Hardly any takes and no fish. Probably something to do with our skills as anglers but perhaps something else is afoot after the place was closed down during the lockdown. Everyone we spoke to had the same experience. Someone mentioned that all 40,000 stock fish may have been released all at once. Who knows! Can have a detrimental effect on the fishing apparently.
The final straw was the very poor attitude of the member of staff we encountered at the end of the day. We felt more or less hurded out of the site. Comments such as ""you can pack up your things off the jetty you know"" were uncalled for. There was a time when you could fish well into the early evening in the Summer. Not anymore! 5:30pm or 5:45pm if you're lucky. Just doesn't seem to be as good value anymore. The toilet issue wasn't ideal either. Although they have provided two portaloos in the car park. Might leave it until next year when the lake, stock and some of the rude staff might have improved. Such a shame as had some wonderful days fishing in the past at this beautiful part of the world.",Date of experience: August 2020,Llyn Brenig Visitor Centre,4,"Cerrigydrudion, United Kingdom"
Drinks with a few nibbles,A very enjoyable couple of hours. Felt happy and safe the whole time. Tasty nibbles and friendly service.,Date of visit: August 2020,The Cornerhouse,4,"Chester, United Kingdom"
Breakfast before heading home.,"This little cafe certainly lives up to its reputation. Lovely staff, lovely food at very reasonable prices! The only reason for 4 stars as opposed to 5 was the lack of fresh fruit juice (only because out of duck). We were, however, given the last of the carton of orange juice in a glass foc. The eggs were also a tad undercooked. I like runny yolks but not fussed on any uncooked egg white. Tough to get right every time when cooking that many eggs per day. I know that I probably could have asked for them done again and they no doubt would have. I'm possibly just too fussy but 5* as I'm sure you'll agree, demands perfection. This breakfast, I have to say, came pretty close! We'll be back next time we're in Cardiff. Diolch am frecwast blasus iawn!",Date of visit: September 2019,Sully's Cafe,4,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"
Last couple of the day so treated like royalty,"What can I say. We arrived at 5pm for an evening meal because we were booked in to watch a show at the St David's Hall. Although they were due to close at 6pm, we didn't feel rushed at all. Our table waiter was absolutely lovely and was very helpful. If you come here expecting the usual curry experience with chicken tikka masala or a chicken korma, you'll be disappointed. Truth is, the menu is a little different and looks a little sparse at first glance. Fact is, the dishes are so flavorful and delicate, you'll be blown away. We both had the mixed bhaji starter which was so wonderful. We then had the Thali which came with a selection of delicious currys, spicey potatoes, popadoms and jappati bread. We opted for the level of spice to be standard but you can ask for it to be slightly milder if you wish. My wife did find some elements to be too spicey for her taste. It's a shame that they are still waiting for their alcohol licence (come on Cardiff Council, get your act together!). This will be the perfect Indian cuisine experience when they are able to serve a nice glass of wine, Cobra beer or Kingfisher beer and open later into the evening. Good luck to all involved. We will be back next time we're in Cardiff.",Date of visit: September 2019,Bwyta Bwyd Bombai - 3B’s,4,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"
"Sunday night meal while in Cardiff for the Brydon, Mitchell and Mac show","I have mixed feelings about our experience at Giovanni's. We arrived with no reservation and were immediately greeted and seated on the first table on the left at the end of the bar. I noticed a brisk draught as soon as we sat. My wife was tucked behind the end of the bar so didn't feel the draught. We were immediately relocated to a table further into the restaurant as soon as I raised the point. Truth is, I was still cold. Thankfully, they closed the front door and hey presto, problem solved.
Onto our meals. My wife is very allergic to scallops and as always, enquired whether or not they cook their other dishes in the same pans as the scallops. The answer came back that they did indeed. This limited her choice of dish. She chose the Tomatoes and Mozzarella starter which was very good followed by a pasta dish with a tomato based sauce with melted mozzarella cheese. The dish was very weak in flavour and creativity. My wife described it as something you'd serve a child. Pasta hoops in tomato sauce or similar. I think they were aware of its poor quality and had no hesitation in omitting the cost from our final bill. I had the mussels in white wine, cream and garlic. Good quantity of mussels but their size and quality left me a little underwhelmed. Some crusty bread to mop up some of the delicious sauce would be a nice touch. I chose the Lasagna for my main course. Very tasty but lacking in sides such as broccoli, or some runner beans or similar. Just a thought. I've had better elsewhere but good non the less. I think this restaurant has some real potential and personality and may have enjoyed better times in the past judging by the photos of some very famous customers in the past. I've no doubt that with only a little more effort and attention to detail, this little gem (if a little scratched and dulled currently) could shine and sparkle once again. The staff are lovely. Thank you for a lovely evening.",Date of visit: September 2019,Giovanni`s Restaurant,4,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"
Last meal before heading home,"Great little spot for watching the world go by while sitting outside. Sadly, food took a while to come out and when it eventually arrived, our Spaghetti Bolognese had become pasta tubes with very little sauce to speak of. Very plain and overpriced.",Date of visit: September 2019,Bouwman,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Breakfast that never really happened,"I'm sure that this establishment has the ability to deliver good food and good service judging by the other reviews on here. We were a party of 7 adults and young men that were clearly too much for the staff that they had on that morning. We ordered some cooked breakfasts, pancakes with bacon and cheese (photo attached). Some of us added a fried egg. All three of the full breakfasts arrived stone cold and other meals simply did not arrive. Oh, we also waited 45 minutes or more for any food to arrive (photo attached of an empty table!). This would have been a 1 star review. The fact that they agreed not to charge for the orange juices, the food that was cold and the food that didn't turn up until everyone else had either finished off given up, is the only reason for the 2nd star. This place clearly has staffing issues and a real lack of ability to deliver top notch service.",Date of visit: September 2019,Titus Parrilla,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
18th Birthday Party trip to Amsterdam,"We've eaten at a different Mexican in Amsterdam in the past which was also very good with a great atmosphere and lots of fun. We thought it was amazing food until we came to Alfonso's! The food was plentiful, fairly priced and sooooo delicious. Service was very good as well. The place looked full when we first looked in through the windows and we very nearly didn't ask if there was anyway to fit our party of 7 in. So glad we did! How was it possible you ask? Well because they have more seating upstairs that was not obvious at first. We all felt very comfortable on the 1st floor dining room and very much enjoyed the whole experience! Thoroughly recommended!",Date of visit: September 2019,Alfonso's Mexican & Grill Restaurant,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
A lovely hotel with roof terrace pool and bar!,"I don't give 5 stars willy nilly for every hotel I stay at but this one would have done if not for a couple of details. It does most definitely deserve 4! The room was lovely (we could see the sea from our balcony.... just!). Had everything you'd need, mini bar fridge that we used for our own bought drinks and snacks, safe, comfy bed, not too hard and not too soft, AC, good sized bathroom with shower and all the free toiletries you'd ever need. The only thing that was a little annoying was the reluctance of the water to drain while in the shower. It was over my ankle by the time if I'd finished which wasn't long at all. I suppose that we should have reported it but we didn't. Based on our experience of the staff, I am certain that it would have been resolved very quickly. All the other amenities of the hotel are wonderful. The roof terrace pool and bar is perfect. There's waiter service for cocktails and other drinks as well as snacks. Lovely infinity pool and free towels. You'll need to get up there sharpish in the morning if you prefer a shaded lounger. The right hand side as you come out of the lift has the best loungers with the best view in my opinion. There is lots to choose from for breakfast including an egg station where you can order freshly cooked eggs in all sorts of ways. All very tasty and cooked well. We regretfully did not sample the restaurant for dinner. We were half board and ate out each night. Please see my reviews of the restaurants we frequented in Sliema & Valleta. Location of the hotel itself is ok. There's a fair bit of construction going on in Sliema (none near the hotel so no building related noise to worry about). Still some nice places to eat and drink within close walking distance. So in summary, I would very much recommend this hotel. A really solid 4 stars and a half if it was possible to give a half star!",Date of stay: July 2019,AX The Victoria Hotel,4,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Meal out with my Mum,I had the Welsh Mussels starter with lamb hock and Mam had the chicken in white wine sauce. Really delicious food with a friendly efficient service. My only observation would be that the mussels starter could have slightly better quality mussels. They were a little small and gritty but very tasty non the less. Came here 30 years ago with my then girl friend who has since become my wife of 25 years. Happy memories. I think my wife and I need a return visit after all these years. Thanks for a lovely meal.,Date of visit: August 2019,The Bridge Inn,4,"Anglesey, United Kingdom"
Silver Wedding Anniversary treat.,"On the whole, my wife and I really enjoyed our stay at the Pestana A Brasileira Hotel. It would have been a 5 star review had it not been for a handful of niggles that you would not expect from a 5* hotel.
Positives: Great welcome by the reception staff. Very informative in terms of places to go, places to eat etc. Upgraded to a Deluxe suite without asking. Lovely room on the 3rd floor facing the street. Very good sound proofing. Comfy bed with large supportive pillows. Safe. Complimentary water, tea and coffee (pre mixed cold coffee in a decanter ; added hot water and was ok). Large walk in shower. His and hers wash basins. Complimentary shower products. Fresh towels every day. Robes and slippers. Fridge with mini bar (did not use any of the products).
Negatives: The complimentary iPhone was not charged and would not charge owing to a poor charger connection(didn't miss using it just curious as to how it could enhance our stay).
Shower temperature fluctuates and gets very hot unexpectedly.
We ordered room service breakfast for the morning of our wedding anniversary. The breakfast arrived after filling in a very confusing door card to place our order. They had interpreted our order incorrectly and brought us two of everything rather than the individual ordered breakfast items that we thought we had ordered. The poached eggs on toast were luke warm at best. On the plus side, my wife really enjoyed the Greek Yogurt, honey and fresh fruit.
The price was also a little steep for what was delivered. This was our very first experience of a room service breakfast. We really wouldn't bother again in all honesty. We ate out every other morning. We chose a room only booking for our stay.
We were also assured that our luggage would be brought up to our room for us. A 5* hotel thing I'm guessing. Anyway, after an hour or so chilling in our room, no sign of our luggage so went down to retrieve them myself. It may have been down to a change of shift of reception staff.
Small stuff really that sadly prevents me from giving a 5* review.",Date of stay: June 2019,Pestana Porto - A Brasileira,4,"Porto, Portugal"
A wonderful tour of the Douro Valley complete with a song or two on the way home.,"Isa immediately made us feel welcomed and arrived bang on time. We were so lucky to have a lovely bunch of people in our group of only 8 including the two of us. Incidentally, Isa is an excellent driver and negotiated some very narrow streets with real skill. Wonderful views, fantastic wines, honey, olive oil and ports to taste. Lovely lunch with as much wine as you can drink in the time allocated for your meal. Lovely river cruise! Tip! Buy a nice bottle of wine from the winery to take on the river cruise! They will even provide some plastic cups with your chilled bottle of white, red or rose. We only paid around €10 for a really tasty bottle of white wine. Isa encouraged us all to sing in the mini bus on the way back. Great fun! Made the return trip fly by! Thanks again Cool Tours. A memorable tour!",,"Douro Valley Small-Group Tour with Wine Tasting, and Optional Lunch and Cruise",4,"Porto, Portugal"
Gold standard restaurant for our Silver Wedding Anniversary!,"La Ricotta is simply wonderful! My wife Pearl and I found this gem purely by chance while wondering around looking for an evening meal. The staff are so welcoming and friendly and the atmosphere is equally chilled and relaxed. We had the beef with squid ink pasta and the delicious Black Pork, both of which were cooked to perfection. We can't really comment on the starters because we weren't adventurous enough to try them apart from the vegetable soup with pasta. It was ok but I suspect that the other starter options are of a much higher quality. The sweets are delicious as are the wines. We were so impressed, we immediately booked a table for our Silver Wedding Anniversary a couple of days later during our stay in the beautiful city of Porto.",Date of visit: June 2019,La Ricotta,4,"Porto, Portugal"
Went on a recommendation from a member of staff at our hotel.,"Great food but make sure you go with an empty stomach. The francesinha is very filling. We had fries with ours that really were not needed. If we go again, we'd share one portion of fries between us. Cold beer and all at reasonable prices. You might have to queue to get a table at busy times but we didn't have to wait for long.",Date of visit: June 2019,Cafe Santiago,4,"Porto, Portugal"
Extra day off tagged onto Easter BH.,"Fabulous food, beautiful outdoors seating area. The fish cake was to die for. My wife's chicken ceaser was also generous and very tasty. So lucky to have quality establishments like the Architect on our doorstep. All in all, a rare 5 star from me.",Date of visit: April 2019,The Architect,4,"Chester, United Kingdom"
Bike ride pit stop.,"Lovely location. Friendly/ grumpy! ;) Must try the Cheesy Chips! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we were served cheesy chips even though they were not on the menu. Paul is legend. Enjoy! Looking forward to Sunday lunch return visit. Belly pork is a must.",Date of stay: April 2019,Carriages,4,"Tattenhall, United Kingdom"
Spur of the moment date night,"My wife and I have been to the Artichoke before. However, we were incognito! We popped in after a friends 50th birthday fancy dress party. I was dressed as Elvis and my wife was one of the ABBA girls! There was a private party going on at the Artichoke but we were welcomed in for obvious reasons. ""Elvis was in the building!"" Some guitar playing and singing was the order of that evening. Anyway, our order on this occasion was the breads with olive oil and balsamic dip and duck followed by the cheese board that we shared. The staff were lovely throughout and the food was really good. Perhaps the duck could have crisper skin but all in all, it was delicious. I would have given a rare 5 stars if only the retro 70s seats were a bit more comfy to sit on. They look good but looks aren't everything. Don't worry, we'll be back again. I've heard that the Sunday lunch is top drawer! Some cushions for the chairs perhaps?",Date of visit: April 2019,Artichoke,4,"Chester, United Kingdom"
Last attraction before our departure,Great tower and spectacular views from the top. Easy climb provided you are fairly fit. Extra cost for the lift a bit mean. We didn't need it. Normal tram tickets work for the tram that takes you up to the tower.,Date of experience: March 2019,Petrin,4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
Group of 8 looked after with exceptional service and good food,"We were pointed in the direction of this little gem by the reception staff of Ostruvek Hotel. We were looking for a hearty meal and some Czec beer after a late ish Sunday evening arrival. We were accommodated immediately on arrival and found ourselves in a cosy corner that allowed all 8 of us to sit down together. We were all excited to sample some local cooking and beer. We chose dishes varying from the pork dish, duck to the Schnitzel. The beer was also really good and incredibly well priced for all. We all enjoyed our meals. Yes, there was a bit of a wait for the meals but that's only because they are all cooked fresh from scratch. We enjoyed it so much, we decided to return for a second visit the evening before our departure. We were not disappointed. The duck dish was my favourite.",Date of visit: March 2019,Restaurant U Kaspara,4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
City break to the wonderful city of Prague,"Our friends found a city break package to which we simply could not say no! Admittedly, I was a little dubious as to what to expect for such a low price. There was 8 of us in our group and I think it's fair to say that we were all pleasantly surprised. Rooms were spacious with comfy beds and big pillows. Our TV was a little dated but worked non the less if the Czec language is within your repertoire. Safe is built into the wall and very sturdy. They insist on room and safe keys being handed in whenever you leave the hotel. Probably makes sense. The key is quite bulky anyway. Just an odd feeling handing your safe key to the hotel. Code access safes are better but hey, this hotel provides an authentic Czec experience so it's ok. We were offered a meal on our arrival but opted to try a bar recommended by the reception staff (check out my review of Caspera). We never did try the evening meal. We always ate out. Breakfast is ok if you're happy with a mainly cold buffet. They do some hot bits like sausage, egg omelette ""cake"". Yes, it's egg, but not as we know it. Quite tasty but only appeared on one morning. Other mornings we had mixed veg, couscous with veg and some other odd choices. Coffee, tea and juices ok. The star of the show was the choice of local breads. Yum! Their toaster is in need of updating. Other than that, all good. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Even smiled on occasion. In summary, I would recommend this hotel as a budget base to explore Prague. The location can appear a little rough in places but you'll find some friendly bars and a nice park to explore within 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Trams also within easy walking distance. No. 18 gets you to the old part of Prague while the 22 will take you to the other side of the river for the castle and Petrin lookout tower. Mini Blackpool or Eiffel Tower depending on where you're from. Food and drink can be very good value the further away you are from the famous Astronomical Clock. A bar on the hill near the castle provided us with a round of 8 drinks for the princely sum of 299 CK. About £10! We did frequent some Irish Bars as well. They tend to charge a little more. 99 CK for one 0.5l beer nearer to the clock. Still, not too bad really. We'll be back.",Date of stay: March 2019,Hotel Ostruvek,4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
Visiting our son at Uni,"A lovely stay in the main and a great welcome from Louis. I only have a couple of small issues. Our room was great with a sea view and all the facilities you need such as tea, coffee, biscuits, tv, towels, shower gel, soap and even hand wash but no traditional shower. Bath with hand held shower head. I suspect that some of the other rooms have a shower instead of a bath. I'll be sure to ask next time. My only other issue was that my fried egg was under done. In hindsight, I should probably have mentioned it to Louis and he would undoubtedly have sorted it for me. We'll be back next time we're visiting our son. I would definitely recommend Glyn Garth as a great place to stay in Aberystwyth. Thanks Louis. See you next time.",Date of stay: March 2019,Glyn Garth Guest House,4,"Aberystwyth, United Kingdom"

A must visit for beer lovers!,"Having done a similar experience at the Guinness Factory in Dublin, I have to say that the Heineken Experience is just as much fun and informative. Some great interactive bits and pieces to do along the way and free beer at the end! Some of us got an extra free beer from the pouring experience/competition. Didn't see any other freebies as mentioned in other reviews. No meatballs from a waiter etc. Also omitted to mention that one of our group was celebrating a birthday. Maybe would have been different if we had. Would definitely recommend a visit while in Amsterdam. We also did the canal cruise as part of the package. Enjoyed learning about some of the history but one of our group fell asleep. Probably one too many Heinekens on top of all the walking involved. Incidentally, we walked a total of 30 miles over 4 days simply because we didn't get to grips with the tram system which I would recommend and will be doing so myself when we return. Then again, we did get to see quite a lot of the city during our ambles!",Date of experience: September 2018,Heineken Experience,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Enlightenment on a grand scale!,"Having heard a few stories and viewed a few paintings on line, it was a real pleasure to properly get to know the troubled soul that was Vincent Van Goch and view his work in the flesh so to speak. Amazingly informative multi media handset and earphones added to the whole experience. For me, the painting of the tree in blossom against the bright blue sky and the story behind his motivation to paint it was a real highlight for me. I felt quite emotional which I really did not expect! Be prepared to do lots of walking up and down stairs (there are lifts) and lots of standing and staring. If you have a niggly back problem like I do, you'll be glad to know that there are plenty of areas to sit and rest. We also elected to have a spot of lunch in the cafe. We had the pea soup that was tasty although could have been hotter. Cake was delicious too. Gift shop has a great choice of souvenirs to buy at reasonable prices.",Date of experience: September 2018,Van Gogh Museum,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Stopped for a sit down and a drink after spending man wonderful hours in the Van Goch museum.,"We opted for the pitchers of beer to share between three of us while our 4th member chose a cocktail. Great atmosphere, staff and the drinks were good. We didn't try any food sadly but it did look delicious. Will be back next time in Amsterdam and will try the food!",Date of visit: September 2018,Cobra Cafe,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
"Classy, clean and very comfortable with great staff!","Top notch hotel with everything you could ever need in your ample sized room. Coffee, tea making facilities, iron and board, robes, slippers, amazing hair dryer, fresh towels every day, wonderful walk in rain shower with hand held shower head as well, free body wash, shampoo etc., very comfortable bed! Our view from our window was of buildings and a patio. We could just about see a canal if you went right up against the glass like a loon and looked left. A well, can't have everything. I'd say that it's the luck of the draw as to what view you end up with. Truth is, city hotels rarely offer a good view so wasn't that bothered really. You won't be disappointed if you choose this hotel for your stay in Amsterdam. Location is close enough to the Metro and the usual popular bits of the old town, if you know what I mean! Some of the other attractions such as the Van Goch museum and Heineken Experience are a good 20 - 30 minute walk away. We took a taxi that the hotel booked for us when we went to the Van Goch museum. As pleasant as he was and knowledgeable about the city's history, his choice of route was let's say, scenic to say the least. His comment about the fact that it is a shorter route for cycling or walking than it is for driving due to the road system left me wondering whether or not we were taken for a ride......literally! An Uber journey to the Heineken Experience the following day which was in the same vicinity was €10 cheaper! Uber all the way in foreign cities for me.",Date of stay: September 2018,Monet Garden Hotel Amsterdam,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Our first bar & drink upon arriving in Amsterdam and it did not disappoint.,"Visited this bar twice during our 4 day visit to Amsterdam. Both times were most enjoyable and the location is beautiful with the Church looming over us. Great place to sit outside and watch the world go by. In summary, good location, good beer, good atmosphere and good staff. Thank you!",Date of visit: September 2018,The Old Church Bar,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Such fun with tasty food to boot!,"As soon as we walked into this little gem, we spotted the ponchos and HUGE sombreros hanging just to the left behind the entrance. Being a thespian in my spare time, I simply could not resist and proceeded to dress up myself and fellow diners from our group of 4. Then this funny little front of house gentleman, Adriano turns up and declares that he will dress us up with colours better suited to our complexion, eyes, hair colour etc! Well, what a scream! We could not stop laughing! I might add at this stage that no substances had been taken other than a couple of glasses of Heineken at the Heineken Experience.
Adriano then proceeded to bring out a free plate of Nachos prior to taking our order. Delicious! Better than the Nachos we had at The Hard Rock Cafe that we visited the day before. (We had tried going back there on this day only to find that they were sold out of Nachos and pretty much everything else we asked for as an alternative and ended up coming here instead - things clearly happen for a reason!)
I've seen some unkind reviews about El Vino and their Nachos on here. Well, if you enter into the fun and games of dressing up, I think that like any performance or stage production, if you really get into it, the performers almost always raise their game and deliver the best show ever! I think that this is what happens here. Of course, it has to be said that if Adriano is on a day off and you are left with his colleague that was very quiet in comparison to say the least, well, your experience may be entirely different.
The food was plentiful and delicious. Yes, it's not fine dining but you simply can't avoid having the best time ever if you're willing to have fun with the costumes and Adriano.
We were there for lunch and immediately booked for dinner that evening and had an equally good time and good wholesome food. I will definitely be seeking out this wonderful place when we return to Amsterdam in the future. Incidentally, please be careful when using the ladies toilet. Make sure you turn the tap off after washing your hands, one of our group accidentally left the tap on which then proceeded to cause a mini flood that Adriano and his colleague had to mop up. Sorry Adriano!",Date of visit: September 2018,El Vino,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Breakfast three mornings in a row!,"We found this cafe restaurant on our way into the centre of Amsterdam from our hotel (see separate review to come). Enjoyed our breakfast and view of Rembrandt's house/museum across the road so much, we decided to return every morning. We had the full breakfast with crispy bacon, veal sausages and a choice of fried or scrambled (both equally good) as well as beans and tomato. Some of us had the bagel with egg and bacon which I myself enjoyed on the last morning. Coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice really good. Good value for money as well!",Date of visit: September 2018,Cafe Restaurant Orff,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Dutch pancakes!,"Having spotted this little place after taking a look at the Anne Frank house, we decided that we should try the Dutch favourite of pancakes before leaving the city that day. I opted for a savoury ham, cheese & mushroom pancake while my wife opted for the Chicken & Bacon club sandwich. We ended up sharing our meals in order to experience both. I must say that the club sandwich was superior to the pancake but would have it on white bread next time as the brown bread was more like very dark malted brown bread and really did not contribute anything to the sandwich. The pancake was ok but I struggled to get over the fact that it looked like a pizza only with a squishy soft base. I think I'll stick to sugar and lemon on my pancakes in future. Worth noting that I tried a little maple syrup with my savoury pancake and it was actually quite nice! The Americans do it all the time apparently. Watch out for the spiral staircase down to the toilets. A bit hairy to say the least!",Date of visit: September 2018,Roem,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
A chilled hour for a beer or two,"What can I say, cool vibe and friendly staff. Enjoyed our beers and a cigar while sitting outside watching the people and tourists of Amsterdam go about their business. Happy! We didn't eat but will look for this place when we return to this wonderful city in the future and will try the meatballs for sure.",Date of visit: September 2018,Schaakcafe Het Hok,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Last minute decision after pondering for what seemed like ages,"We chose this steakhouse after spending a good while trying to decide which of the many steakhouses in central Amsterdam to select for our dinner on our second evening in this wonderful city. Our group of four were in the main very happy with their choices and the service was good even though they were clearly busy. Incidentally, I was given advice by two separate friends that your best bet for a good steak or meal in general is to look for a steakhouse that is full of diners. My only criticism would be that they are a little overpriced for what I would call a decent steak. I've enjoyed steak in the UK at one of the top steakhouse chains and paid less than we did here for a much better product, service and experience on the whole. Still warrants 4 stars but would have been 5 had it been better value for money.",Date of visit: September 2018,De Nachtwacht,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Birthday celebrations. 🍻🍾🎂,"Having read some of the previous reviews about the Seacroft, I have to admit that I was a little concerned that the evening might end up being a little disappointing. I suppose that some punters have impossibly high standards that will never be fulfilled. Being August the 4th, it was heaving with holiday makers but the staff were dealing with the manic pace like a well oiled machine. The front of house staff were very helpful and friendly with nothing being too much trouble. We were a party of 13 and all the meals came out within minutes of each other with nobody having to wait uncomfortably for their meal to arrive. We were also able to bring a birthday cake that the waitress brought out while we all sang the usual Happy Birthday ditty. Oh, by the way, the food was top notch as well. Hence, a rare 5 from me. Well done Seacroft.",Date of visit: August 2018,The Seacroft,4,"Anglesey, United Kingdom"
Last treat on our way home from our weekend in London,Great value and very tasty carvery. The presence of a few retired folk clearly confirms my opening statement. Very conveniently located a minute or two off the A50 of you're looking for a easy lunch stop. The atmosphere is very welcoming and friendly. The busy road adjacent to the beer garden seating area prevented us from eating outside. 4.5 stars none the less from us.,Date of visit: July 2018,The Boars Head Hotel,4,"Draycott in the Clay, United Kingdom"
Bruno Mars weekend,"Sadly, I must concur with a few reviewers in terms of the misleading nature of many of the reviews about this hotel. There's a few that are a lot more frank and honest and these are the ones you should pay attention to. We paid £120 per room while others it would seem paid £80. I'd have been a little more forgiving had the basement cupboard we were given as a room been £80. The room also was extremely tired and needed a serious refurbishment. Our friends room upstairs on the ground floor was not much bigger but was clearly recently updated. Rusty radiator and flaking ceiling paint above the tiny shower as well as a hole in the bathroom door were all evidence of poor maintenance. The shower was fun to operate. A bit like working out the combination on a safe. Left a bit....too hot! Right a bit......brrr, too cold. Petty perhaps, but should be better for the money they are asking for the room.
Breakfast was very nice and Georgio, the waiter very funny. Echoes of Manuel from Fawlty Towers? His humor very nearly helped us forget that 1 out of our party of 4 had to wait over 30 minutes for her breakfast. Everyone else on our table had long finished by the time it finally arrived. It wasn't just our table either. A couple of other guests had similar problems. Having said all that, the actual breakfast was very tasty. We were also given as much toast and tea as we could eat and drink. It may have been a one off rush due to several guests arriving for breakfast at once. Georgio was ever so apologetic and kept repeating, ""is a not my fault!"" I think I'll go for a Travel lodge or Premier Inn for our next visit to London. A bit pricier but you know exactly what to expect.",Date of stay: July 2018,St. David's Hotels,4,"London, United Kingdom"
A pleasant enough day out with our own version of a pole dancer!,"This is one of those catamaran sea trips that relies heavily on the sea conditions and weather being nothing short of perfect. Without those elements present, it is still enjoyable but won't leave you with that feeling that you have just experienced something extra special. We did a very similar excursion in Fuerta Ventura in 2016 that was cheaper, more fun and had a richer itinerary. Yes, the weather was much better but not perfect. Ah well, mustn't compare as each one has its own interpretation of an itinerary and what should be included in the price (there lies another story that I will come to shortly). The crew were nice enough and the food OK. BBQ chicken fillets and sausages with a nice selection of cold salads. If you're wondering why the title of this review mentions a pole dancer, well truth is I'm being a tad facetious. One of our fellow punters was a young mum with her partner and young family in tow, one of which was a very cute baby girl not more than 6 or 7 months old. Clearly, her attention was on the baby for much of the trip. That's fine in itself and to be fair, the baby was very content and didn't cry once on the catamaran. My point is that she may as well have been doing it in her underwear such was the ultra skimpy nature of her swimwear. It's probably just me and probably should have just stared at my feet. Then again, what would be the point of that when you're surrounded by beautiful views of the sea, sky and shore line. So to what's included. It has to be said that our nice holiday rep over sold the excursion when he mentioned that the trip included a BBQ and drinks THROUGHOUT! Sounded about right to me based on the price charged. Over 250€ for the 4 of us. Like some reviewers on here, you'll be a tad disappointed if you believe what you're told by the rep. Drinks are included for 1 hour during the BBQ as the rep confidently informed me AFTER the event. The excursion we did in Fuerta Ventura included all drinks and snacks throughout. No BBQ admittedly but then again a great deal cheaper all told. You'll find the review for it in my thread. It was top notch which sadly I can't say for Magic Catamaran. Just make sure you check the forecast prior to booking. Wind and clouds equals clouded waters for snorkeling and no warm sun to dry you off after your swim. It was our fault for choosing the wrong day weather wise so perhaps 3 stars is a tad unfair. Would give 3.5 if I could.",Date of experience: July 2018,Magic Catamarans,4,"Majorca, Spain"

520m of beautiful views,"After a hairy journey up the twisty albeit wide (in the main) route up to the summit, we were greeted with spectacular 360 views. I enjoyed the drive it if I'm honest. We spent a good hour taking in the majesty of the place and also enjoyed a light lunch in the cafe while sitting at a table with a view. We encountered a couple of boy racers treating the route as a hill climb on our way back down. Other than that we very much enjoyed our visit to Sant Salvador's Monastery and monument.",Date of experience: July 2018,Santuari De Sant Salvador,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Chilled afternoon watching the super cruisers come into the marina.,Found this little cafe following our walk down to the Marina. Enjoyed two jugs of sangria at reasonable prices.

Acting on a work colleagues recommendation.,"We took advice from the many reviews and indeed from my colleague and booked a good few days in advance. We arrived to find this gem of a restaurant and location buzzing with customers and the aroma of delicious sea food dishes of all kinds filling our senses. Needless to say, the food was beautifully prepared & presented and as fresh as can be. I can see why some would say that the staff might come across as rude. I suspect that due to its popularity and the number of guests they deal with, the staff are no doubt under pressure to deliver. They could be a little more friendly but this is not one of the Greek Islands so don't expect the same hospitality. Would definitely come back for more.",Date of visit: July 2018,S'Arenal De Portocolom,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Spot of lunch mid cycle ride on a warm May Bank Holiday,This place is just a wonderful little gem ideally placed for a cycle ride pit stop. We've just enjoyed two very fresh and tasty chicken salads as well as a lovely rhubarb Bakewell slice. Lovely outside seating area. Could do with a shady area as properly hot when the sun was out. A bit of a sun trap. Good value too. We'll be back for sure.,Date of visit: May 2018,Meadow Lea Farm Cafe,4,"Chester, United Kingdom"
50th Birthday Celebrations,"I have to say that our stay at Rose Tor Hotel was very good. Room was clean and spacious although the en suite was bijou to say the least. It was fun trying to dock with the lavatory! Slept well even though our room was on the ground floor at the front of the hotel. I suspect that the drinks consumed may have contributed! We were there to celebrate a 50th birthday after all. Breakfast was varied. My plate was missing a sausage on our first morning. It did, however, arrive sharpish after notifying the waitress. Breakfast was spectacular on the following morning; 2 fried eggs, 2 bacon, 2 grilled tomatoes and 2 sausages! All cooked to perfection. Plenty of fresh and tinned fruit with a selection of cereals as well. The bar is well stocked and a few of us enjoyed an afternoon watching football. The Guinness was the canned variety but was OK. In summary, The Rose Tor is very good value for money with friendly staff to boot.",Date of stay: April 2018,Rose Tor Hotel,4,"Llandudno, United Kingdom"
A cooked breakfast after a night out over Easter BH,"Although my wife and I have been aware of Rhino Cafe for a while, we had not found an opportunity to try it until now. It was one of those mornings after a drink or seven when you need something substantial for breakfast but don't have the energy to cook it yourself. I'm glad to say that this little cafe delivered exactly what we were looking for. A tasty cooked breakfast with quality ingredients prepared with lots of love and care. Both came with toast and tea or filter coffee. Yum! Bigger versions can be ordered at extra cost if you're appetite is bigger than ours or just add extra this or that to your plate. News papers available too. We also note that they offer curry evenings whereby you can bring your own alcohol. We'll be back to try their Indian fayre very soon. Keep up the good work.",Date of visit: March 2018,Rhino Coffee House,4,"Chester, United Kingdom"
Overnight stop on our journey to Lyon,"First impressions were encouraging. Especially when I clocked the roaring wood fire in the corner. The smells and warmth were very welcoming. After a brief exchange of hand signals and poorly pronounced French, the gentleman on reception issued our keys for room 25 and off we went. The hotel is arranged in a motel sort of way whereby you drive or walk around the outside of the building to find your room and adjacent parking space. The room itself turned out to be a disabled friendly room that proved to be perfect for my 84 yr old Mum. I had mentioned when booking that she was a little infirm and would prefer a ground floor room where possible. Nice to see that they had given the room choice some thought. The room itself was very pleasant and warm on our arrival. A little too warm when it came to sleeping. I probably could have switched the heating off had I taken a closer look at the controls. Too lazy and tired after my drive from Chester in the UK! By the time we were ready to eat, it was too late to attempt exploring one of Saint-Quentin's local restaurants so we elected to eat at the hotel. While the prices were a tad expensive for our needs that evening, it's safe to say that the portions and quality were off the scale! With drinks and three main courses, our bill came to approximately €100. My Silrloin was massive and cooked to perfection with delicious chips. My wife's beef was also beautifully cooked as was my Mum's salmon. I would definitely recommend this hotel!",Date of stay: March 2018,Le Pot d'Etain,4,"Holnon, France"
Stop over en route to Callais,"As our last stop on our way home from our road trip to Lyon, this hotel was eagerly anticipated due to the 5 hour drive through a very snowy France. We were pleased to find the hotels location easy to find in relation to the A26. Apart from the lack of disabled access for my Mum to enter the hotel, first impressions were good. We were booked in very quickly and easily by the friendly reception staff. Our room was on the 4th floor but close to lift exit that was helpful in terms of access for my elderly Mum. The room itself was clean and functional with tea / coffee making facilities, TV etc. We even had a view of the Cathedral over the tops of adjacent buildings. Having arrived a little later than planned, we elected to eat in the hotel's restaurant. Good quality with no frills is how I would describe the fayre. Prices fairly reasonable for dinner but breakfast was too expensive in my opinion for what was on offer. I would advise seeking breakfast elsewhere if you have the time which we sadly did not. Chunnel train to catch which ended up being delayed by nearly 3 hours due to technical difficulties. That will be a whole other review!",Date of stay: March 2018,Campanile Reims Centre - Cathedrale,4,"Reims, France"
Aber Uni Applicants day,"It has to be said that following a recommendation, all three of us were looking forward to trying Baravin. I would say that two out of three of us would have given 4 stars based on their delicious meals which were the risotto and the chicken and smoked bacon carbonara. Trust me, I tasted both the meals myself while staring at the remaining half of my pulled pork, caramelised onion and blue cheese pizza that to my mind just did not work in terms of the combination of ingredients and flavours. I very rarely leave that much food on my plate. I feel that whoever devised the menu were a little ambitious to think that blue cheese on a pizza would not overpower every other ingredient present which were weak anyway.
Starters were OK as far as cheese with cerano ham, mushrooms and green leaves on some rustic bread can impress.
So the question is; would I come back here and try again? Yes! I would come again but will most definitely avoid blue cheese on pizza next time around. Truth is, being creative with a pizza menu must be tough. Stick to the usual suspects would be my advice for what it's worth.",Date of visit: February 2018,Baravin,4,"Aberystwyth, United Kingdom"
"""Rushed"" 21st Birthday treat for our eldest son","Our son is a big fan of steak and an even bigger fan of Liverpool Football Club. Would you believe it! He got the very best of both when we arrived at Miller and Carter on the 22nd for his 21st Birthday meal. How is this possible I here you all ask. Read on to find out. We arrived to be shown to the bar for a drink while they prepared our table. The ambience of the whole place reeks quality as soon as you walk up to the well stocked bar. Beers, ales, spirits and all manner of cocktails available to tickle anyones fancy. While waiting for our drinks, I turned to lean on the bar, as one does, to observe the room and partake in a spot of people watching. It was at this moment that I did one of those comedy double looks as none other than Mr Ian Rush walked in with a very classy looking lady on his arm. They settled in at the bar table next to ours. I, of course, started gesturing to my son to look to his right while trying to remain as calm as possible when in the presence of a genuine Anfield legend! After a ""cap in hand"" style request for a selfie, Mr Rush was very kind and the evening had started with the bar set impossibly high. I have to say that Miller & Carter also delivered with steak meals cooked to perfection. Cutting through my rump steak was like cutting through butter. It's safe to say that we will be back. Perfect evening!",Date of visit: December 2017,Miller & Carter Chester,4,"Chester, United Kingdom"
Lads Weekend to Peterborough - morning after breakfast!,"Although Bill's did the job in general, I have to say that I have had better cooked breakfasts. A little on the pricey side expecially when we added the black pudding option at £1.55; the main issue was the dryness of the whole plate. Fried eggs were on the firm side. Perhaps a small portion of beans would help. The two discs of black pudding were also over cooked and too dry. The generous two slices of toast just added to the problem. I would come again as I believe that their other menu choices might be better. Also, the evening menu may also be better. Nice atmosphere and the staff were lovely and very helpful.",Date of visit: November 2017,Bill's Peterborough,4,"Peterborough, United Kingdom"
Unexpected treat after the University of Birmingham open day,"Yes! Believe me when I say that every element of this establishment has the whiff of excellence; from the diverse choice of beers and ales to the delicious food served by the attentive staff. My 17 yr old son commented that his Burger was the best he's ever had! He's had a few in his time! We're not talking about the fast food variety either. My Fish & Chips with mushy peas and tartar sauce was, in my humble opinion, better than Rick Steins Chippy in Padstow. My wife's Hake was equally impressive. I'll not only be returning, but also recommending this place to all my friends and family. I'm just hoping that our son gets an offer from University of Birmingham for obvious reasons!",Date of visit: October 2017,Purecraft Bar & Kitchen,4,"Birmingham, United Kingdom"
50th Birthday Treat return to our honeymoon location 23 yrs ago!,"I have to say that the Astoria Park Hotel & Spa grew on us over the course of our holiday. First impressions were in the main very good. Deborah on reception was very helpful, friendly and welcoming on our arrival. We were lucky to find a parking space at the front of the hotel for our huge Opel Insignia estate hire car which was an unexpected upgrade (see my review on our hire car provider). However, spaces are limited and do fill up quickly. There is an underground car park but they charge €10 per night for this. Thankfully, there's a free car park adjacent to a sports centre across the road that we used after returning from a day trip to find no spaces at the hotel car park.
Our room was located at the anex building a short walk away through the gardens. Quiet location away from any traffic noise. OK if your happy with the walk to and from your room. We were fine with it but I can imagine someone with walking difficulties having issues. Incidentally, when we first went looking for our room with our 22Kg case in tow, we were not advised whether or not a lift was available. There's no signage to suggest the presence of a lift when you arrive at the anex building. We assumed that our only option was the stairs. Lugging our case up the stairs with my bad back could have been disastrous but we managed with one or two loud expletives (sorry if anyone was within earshot). Seems that there is a lift after all! At the other end of the corridor that's in the dark until you trigger the automatic lights. We were relieved to know that there wouldn't be a repeat performance of the suit case crash bang wallop show on our departure. The room itself was OK. Clean and comfortable with a part view of the mountains (in fairness, they are visible pretty much from anywhere in Riva due to their imposing height!). There was a hint of a stale wet bathroom smell when we first walked into the room. Didn't bother us really but worth mentioning in terms of useful feedback for the hotel cleaning staff.
Dining at the Astoria was in the main very good. One little hiccup with the delivery of our bottle of wine was more than made up for later in our stay. Great breakfast buffet. Lots of choice from pancakes to pastries to eggs, bacon and sausage (don't expect anything like a British banger). All sorts of fruit and cereals too.
Evening meals were very good with the exception of one pasta dish that had cabbage and sausage meat. The cabbage gave it a bitter aftertaste that was not pleasant. This part of Italy attracts a great deal of European holiday makers due to its close proximity and Riva's mountain biking and sailing activities. By the way, I think Riva and Torbole are second only to Amsterdam for the shear number of bicycles. Wasn't like this in 1994! I digress! Sorry! My point is that perhaps the hotels are attempting to cater for many palates from all over Europe so it's inevitable that one or two dishes will not be to your liking. Be patient! The next course or following days menu will most probably blow you away. A beef dish we had towards the end of our stay was gorgeous and melted in the mouth. (See photo)
The bar and Cafe staff are lovely and always try their hardest to look after you. The little nibbles they bring with your drinks are a nice touch. Sometimes bring cannapes as well. All free! Drink prices are what you'd expect in a hotel of this status so make sure you keep track of your bar bill if putting on your room. Especially if you're on a fixed budget for your spending money.
Finally, I must thank the restaurant staff for the lovely gesture of bringing out a Birthday cake for me and singing Happy Birthday to me along with two or three of the other tables around us! A lovely memory! (See photo)

A clear sign that everyone really enjoyed their lunch. 5 different meat choices (tried a slice of each), each one cooked to perfection. Glorious veg and Yorkshire Pud.

Father's Day Sunday Lunch,Booked via Booking.com for a family treat to celebrate Fathers Day as well as our 23rd Wedding Anniversary. Noticed one or two average reviews but thought we'd give it a go and make up our own minds. Very nice surroundings and very friendly staff. The only let down was the poor attention to detail in terms of the presentation of our Roast Beef meals. Two or three of the roast potatoes were burnt and the Yorkshire Puddings were flat and far too brittle/crispy. The beef itself although plentiful and tasty was a bit tough to cut and chew. Perhaps a matter of preference. Also my pudding arrived a good 5 minutes or more after everyone else's which left me eating mine alone. It's fair to say that my two son's meals were much better.

Yes, they charge a little more but boy is it worth it.

A little respite from the All Inclusive version of breakfast,"Following a recommendation by a lady at the Lavante Speed Boat tours office, a trip yet to come as I write, we went down to Grace's (or Graces Bar as it's called on here) for a good slap up English Breakfast. There were 8 of us in our group and our arrival was immediately greeted with a friendly smile and welcome from Julie. The food was top notch with proper English bacon, sausages and in my case, black pudding. Lovely cup of tea, toast and all the usual suspects such as eggs and fried bread were also included. Everyone fell silent while we ate; a good sign! Would very much recommend if you fancy a change from the All Inclusive option or are self catering in a Villa or similar. Oh, by the way, very good value as well. 5 of the 8 meals came to €30 in total. Thank you Julie! We'll be back, maybe sooner than you think to sample your Fish n Chips or Shepherd's Pie!",Date of visit: June 2017,Graces Bar,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
A great day out at a very good water park,"A great day spent at the Zante Water Village. The coach ride there was only 30 mins from Tsilivi. The park itself was very quiet on the day we visited; 1st June. Suspect it's fairly early in the season. No queues for rides and plenty of sun loungers to choose from. The only down side to the day was the mini bus provided for our return trip to Tsilivi. One of our group had to sit on her boyfriend's lap. The air con was not on either and the bus had sat in the baking hot sun for a long time before we boarded. Had it been any longer than a 30 minutes ride, my score would have been much lower than 4. Overall, a good day. Would hire a car or quad if I come here again.",Date of experience: June 2017,Water Village,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Birthday meal to celebrate our friend Andrea's Birthday.,Recommended this restaurant by Julie at Grace's Cafe. It didn't disappoint! Lovely atmosphere and the food was to die for. Great menu to cater all tastes. The place was still full at 22:18! Would recommend booking in advance if your party is bigger than 4 like ours was. Enjoy peoples!,Date of visit: June 2017,The Halfway House,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Stupendous Sunday Lunch to celebrate a 50th Birthday.,"Considering that there was a few of us present to celebrate our friend's 50th Birthday, the staff at The Castle Hotel were very welcoming and went out of their way to accommodate us all. The table was short of two place settings and chairs but was resolved very quickly. Great draught beers and lagers always available. The choice of three different roasts; Lamb, Beef and Turkey was excellent and all cooked beautifully and pipping hot on the plate. Accompanied by plenty of veg, stuffing and a very big, tasty Yorkshire pudding regardless of your choice of meat! We had Birthday Cake for afters so didn't try any of the sweets. The Beer Garden at the rear is spacious and comfortable. All in all, a very pleasant few hours spent on a Bank Holiday Sunday in May.",Date of visit: May 2017,The Castle Hotel,4,"Wem, United Kingdom"
A welcome hot drink and a shared scone,"My wife and I have tried a few cafes in and around Chester. The Barista's cafe proved to be up there with the best of them. Friendly atmosphere, comfortable surroundings and our choice of a shared scone with a tea and a Flat White was to a high standard. We will run return soon. Thanks.

Snack stop after shopping trip,"Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye! Yum yum yum! Fab pot of proper tea, tasty home made houmous with toasted pita bread, mixed breads with balsamic and olive oil. All followed by a tasty scone. Will be definitely coming back. Oh, and by the way, all served in a lovely chilled atmosphere. Thank-you!",Date of visit: January 2017,Atina Kitchen,4,"Chester, United Kingdom"
Tasty brunch after a drizzly walk along the Wirral Way,"My wife Pearl and I have sampled the delights of this friendly little cafe a fair few years ago and have always planned to go back. We were invariably in a hurry or on a promise to be somewhere else each time we came walking to Parkgate. Not this time! We made sure that we had allowed enough time to revisit Mozkitos and indulge in their delicious locally sourced eggs, bacon and black pudding. I am happy to report that it was just as we'd remembered when we were last here with our now dear departed Greyhound Belle. Yes! Dog friendly too! Lovely staff, lovely, freshly prepared food..... what are you waiting for? Get over to Parkgate for a lovely walk followed by a tasty treat at this charming cafe. We'll be back for sure. Won't wait years this time either!",Date of visit: January 2017,Mozkitos Coffee House,4,"Parkgate, United Kingdom"
An adventure on the terrace!,"Well! My wife and I have looked forward to trying the Opera Grill for a long time. A Christmas shopping day in Chester presented the perfect opportunity. We arrived to be offered a choice of either the main restaurant or the roof terrace. Being quite adventurous, we opted for the terrace. We ordered our steak main courses (Wow! More about the steak later) and all was well until the retractable roof suddenly began to open, exposing us to a rather chilly wind and grey skies. The halogen heating lamps were on but we still looked at each other in disbelief as the roof finally arrived at its fully open position. Turns out that the Chief Executive of the establishment insists that the roof is open whenever there is no rain, regardless of the time of year! Suffice to say we opted to move downstairs to the warmer main restaurant. Having said all that, the service, food and atmosphere is nothing short of spectacular. Would have been 5/5 if it wasn't for the Chief Executives silly ideas about the terrace. By the way, the steak and triple cooked chips were to die for and against must try!",Date of visit: December 2016,Opera Grill,4,"Chester, United Kingdom"
Nice as Pie!,"This is our second visit to this lovely little deli cafe. I chose the hot Ham, Black Pudding and Mustard Cream pie. It came with some home made Slaw and salad. It was nothing short of stupendous and right up my street. My wife chose a chicken salad and mayo sandwich that had so much filling, it was fit to burst. Lovely staff completed a very pleasant lunch time treat. We are also big fans of the Cheshire Sandwich Shop and can safely say that the Watergate Deli is most definitely on a par. Oh dear! I can see some tough decisions coming in the future.",Date of visit: October 2016,49 Watergate,4,"Chester, United Kingdom"
Birthday Celebrations!,"A lovely evening. Although the food took a little longer than we expected to arrive, it was delicious and the staff were very good and kept us informed as to the eta of the food. I think if they advise up front that all the food is prepared fresh and that it might take a little longer than usual to be served, then people would be more understanding and appreciate the effort that goes on behind the scenes. Make sure that you're not ravenous hungry before going. Would go again. Prices not too bad either. Our choice of wine was spot on and again quite reasonable.",Date of visit: October 2016,Et Alia,4,"Chester, United Kingdom"
