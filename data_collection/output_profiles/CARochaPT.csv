Well deserved 5 stars!,"My family and I strongly recommend this activity. We have been on other greek islands of the Cyclades, and have had also quite wonderful boat rides, but this one was somehow different and surprising. Tina and her father take realy good care of you, one feels they have true pleasure in showing us their island, with no rush whatsoever. We had a delitious meal that they prepared on board, with fish that they also caught on board (the nets having been laid at dawn). We had time to snorkel at beautyfull Kleftikos, and other places, and our daughter (6 years old) had a great time fishing with a cane pole (as other children and teens on board, overjoyed with the actual experience of fishing). And yes, there was time for all of this (as I said, no rush whatsoever).",Date of experience: August 2019,Milos Fishing Trip,5,"Milos, Greece"
