Tranquil Trip,"My husband and I travelled to Elounda for a few days arriving 25th July 2020. We chose to stay at Elounda Heights based on the beautiful views, lovely gardens and the excellent reviews. We weren't disappointed and enjoyed a wonderfully relaxing and tranquil few days at this hotel where we were very well looked after by Natalia, Clio, George, Kostas and all of the very hard working team. The levels of hygiene were exceptional with all the rules in place during the current pandemic observed to the letter. The rooms are charming, bright and clean - we had a lovely superior studio with a very large terrace overlooking the gardens and the beautiful Mirabello Bay. It's very short walk down into Elounda although t's a very steep hill so the walk back is a little more challenging and if you've had an ouzo or two too many a taxi is only 5 euro. In my opinion it was the little touches that made our stay at Elounda Heights so special for example complimentary water when you have settled by the pool, the lovely home made or baked goodies at breakfast and the generosity with the raki when you are having a few drinks at the bar. Overall if you are heading to Elounda, I can't imagine a nicer place to stay particularly if you are looking for peace, quiet and being a bit spoiled! Thanks to everyone for your hospitality and all the best for the rest of the season.",Date of stay: July 2020,Elounda Heights (Adults only),4,"Crete, Greece"
City quality cocktails!!,"This cocktail bar is now called Labyrinth. We dropped in a few times for both pre and post dinner cocktails. It's beautifully decorated, clean and cool and the staff are friendly and charming. Spiro who prepared our cocktails is a real perfectionist and stopped for a chat. I have to say I had the best Espresso Martini here that I've ever had and they give any city cocktail bar a run for their money. Highly recommend a visit! See you next year guys!

"Fishing, food & fun!!","This day out with the lovely Captain Giorgos and his crew was well worth getting up early for! We watched the sunrise as we headed out to sea from Zante Town at 7.30am. After the nets were cast we headed for a lovely, secluded beach only accessible by boat or bike for swimming and free time, then back to haul in the catch which we subsequently stuffed our faces with over a lovely lunch set up on board with wine, beer and charming conversation with Giorgos. On the return journey we sunbathed and had a few more drinks ... bliss!! We went on this trip as a group of 12 friends and it's quite a unique day out as far as boat trips in Zakynthos go. It's safe to say that after we recovered from the early start we all had a brilliant time. Thanks Giorgos and crew for looking after us and for a wonderful day out on the water!

Favourite Restaurant in Tsilivi,"We really look forward to our visits with Tim and all the team at Halfway House and probably eat here at least 3 or 4 times during our hols for lunch or dinner or sometimes just an ice cold Mythos. The menu is well thought out and the food is excellent as are the cocktails, ice creams and desserts (if you have room). Best Bloody Mary and burger in town for sure!! This year looking forward to trying some of Tim's new cocktails and the deep fried ice-cream - see you in September :) X",Date of visit: September 2015,The Halfway House,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Wonderful Kefalonia!,"My husband and I have just returned from a wonderful 10 day holiday staying at Dionysos Village in Lassi. The first point to make is that photos simply do not do the views any justice at all, they are simply stunning whether you are on your terrace/balcony or at the pool/bar.

The staff are all great! A special hello to my Darlings at the bar - Sia and Monica who kept the beer and the conversation flowing for us, and to Maria for always being the hostess with the mostess especially at the resort evening events (Greek Night, Rock Night etc.). Yiannis takes great care of you in the restaurant and the maids and the gardener always greet you with a smile too. A lovely place to stay all round.

Lassi is very nice with plenty of restaurants, a few bars and a gorgeous beach with a couple of beach bars and Argostoli is almost as close, just over the hill from Dionysos, and definitely worth a visit for dinner, some shopping and a stroll around the harbour.

There is so much of beautiful Kefalonia we did not get to see and do on our holiday so we will happily have to return to the island, and to Dionysos Village in the future for more sun, sea, relaxation and fun.

See you all again soon.

"Wonderful food, welcoming staff and a lovely atmosphere!","This tapas/meze restaurant is one of a kind in the village of Tsilivi where you are spoilt for choice when it comes to great places to eat. Charlotte and the team are very welcoming and helpful, and one of the only places to grab a lovely bottle of Prosecco. We ate here twice during our recent stay, and would have squeezed in another visit if we could. The food is wonderful, but it will take another few visits to sample everything on the menu. Go to La Meze, give it a try, you won't be disappointed!",Date of visit: September 2015,La Meze Tapas & Wine bar,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"

Welcome Home !!,"We have been back to Paradise Bar whenever we have stayed in Tsilivi because of the warm welcome, the friendly staff and brilliant fun everyone has in this place. The bar is family run, and the guests are made to feel like family too! We have made many good friends in Paradise Bar, both with the staff and with other visitors we have met sitting round the bar enjoying a few drinks and a good laugh with while on holiday. You will be well looked after. Everyone is welcome, all ages, families, singles, couples .... I would highly recommend you drop by for a visit and see for yourself. Once you do, you might never leave !!",Date of experience: September 2013,Paradise cocktail bar,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
"Great location, beach & staff !","We stayed at Beachscape Kin Ha for 2 nights on 30th May 2013 before heading down to Playa Del Carmen, so it was just a short stop over. We booked on a room only basis, and got a very competitive internet rate, so wasn't surprised that the room and facilities were basic but we had a lovely sea view from our balcony overlooking the gorgeous beach.

All the staff at the hotel are very friendly and helpful with a particular mention to the team in the beachfront restaurant/bar who kept us stocked up with cold beer and margarita's. The setting here is fabulous, the beach is so clean and the sea beautifully calm. All the staff we met were polite and friendly. Food is good, nothing out of this world but good selection at breakfast and all the grounds, gardens and buildings are well maintained, clean and pretty. I'd definitely recommend this hotel for a few days if you are stopping over in Cancun during your travels!",Date of stay: May 2013,Beachscape Kin Ha Villas & Suites,4,"Cancun, Mexico"
