"Day out with Michalis, Antonia and Nikki","From the start to the end, this trip was joyful and fun. Leaving around 8.30am we set out as the morning hue still shrouded the Islands around us. The Ionian sea was calm, the sky was azure and the sun was still warming the sea and land.
Anatonia was the most attentive host. The day started with Greek coffee and a fabulous breakfast cake. Travelling along the coast line you get to see Kefalonia at its very best.
The food, caught and landed whilst on board, is prepared and cooked while you either swim in the bay or stay on deck drinking home made wine. We were served an absolute feast. Beautifully cooked, we were joined by the Captain to enjoy the oceans larder together. We dined as kings!
I would highly recommend this trip.",Date of experience: June 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
