Once again we thoroughly enjoyed our evening.
From entering the restaurant and the friendly greeting, throughout the night with lovely food and great service, everything was perfect.

This time did not let us down either.
Excellent cocktails served in a lovely setting. The staff are super friendly, very attentive and informative.

Lovely place to visit,"We visited this restaurant recently and we are really glad we did.
A nice setting with very friendly staff.
The menu was only a small choice, but all the food we had was lovely, fresh and very tasty, with a slight twist on a normal menu.
Lovely relaxed place to enjoy a very nice meal and chill away a couple of hours.
Will definitely be back in the future.",Date of visit: September 2019,The Mad Hunter,4,"Preston, United Kingdom"
Lovely place to visit,"Decided to try this out this year and really glad we did.
It is ran by a lovely couple, who are passionate and very knowledgeable about the job they do.
We were greeted with a drink and explanation of what to expect during the visit.
Once that was over we were supplied with the suits and off to the hives.
The information given was fascinating and put across in an interesting and friendly way.
After the hives you are take to their small laboratory, where you are shown how the honey is processed and sample the various products.
Finally back for a few tasting samples & a drink, which were delicious, followed by a little ""homework"" and a chance to buy the products if you wish to.
A great and interesting way to spend a couple of hours, with lovely people if in the area.",Date of experience: September 2019,Dias Beekeeping,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Beautiful setting, lovely meal","We went for a meal here last night.

The food was lovely and the service was friendly and excellent.
It was so relaxing eating in such a lovely setting in the garden and will definitely be returning",Date of visit: September 2019,En Kefallinia Organic Farm Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Another excellent trip,"We have just been on our third trip with Antonia & Mixalis and it was as excellent as ever.
Once on board the boat you are offered coffee and cake to start off your day.
You then sail to where the nets have been set the previous night and the catch is pulled in onto the ship.
You are able to help getting the fish out of the nets if you wish, or just sit back and relax.
Once the nets are in, you sail to a little secluded bay where you have swim time while the catch is prepared for your lunch.
The food is obviously as fresh as it can be and delicious, washed down by a lovely white wine produced from the family vineyard.
Our third time with this lovely family and we will to return on our next trip to Kefalonia.
Beautiful, relaxed day with lovely people, highly recommended.",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Always fresh and tasty fish and good portion of crispy chips.
Always my preferred choice in Cleveleys.",Date of visit: September 2019,Steve's Fish and Chips,4,"Thornton Cleveleys, United Kingdom"
Afternoon Tea,"We visited The Gotham for the afternoon tea to celebrate my birthday.
When we arrived we were greeted by the concierge, who was friendly and witty with all the quips, which was a nice touch and immediately made you relax.
Once inside we were guided to the bar as we were a little early and the restaurant wasn't quite open.
Again absolutely brilliant service in a very relaxed atmosphere and most helpful staff.
We had a look around the bar area and the terraces with the views over Manchester before having drinks.
We were then advised our table was ready whenever we were, but no rush, we were left to chill and enjoy the surroundings.
Once we went in for the afternoon tea, again all the staff were so friendly and excellent.
The sandwiches and selection of cakes were lovely, fresh and very tasty.
Unlimited tea & coffee was also available.
We just loved everything about the afternoon, but without doubt all the fabulous staff made this a most enjoyable experience.
Would definitely do this again!",Date of stay: June 2019,Hotel Gotham,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"

Call in for a chilled relaxed night with great people.,Date of experience: May 2019,Legends Music and Cocktail Bar,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
First visit - Pleasant surprise,"We made our first visit to this taverna after passing by it for our last two trips. No reason for never previously trying it, but always walked past to a different taverna.
When we went in we were very pleasantly surprised.
It is a large taverna, with a small play area for children.
The greeting was polite and warm and we were shown to our seats.
The food was absolutely gorgeous and the service was prompt, attentive and friendly.
We enjoyed it so much, we revisited a couple of days later and the experience was just as good.
If you want a lovely meal in lovely friendly surroundings, with a fantastic view of the sun setting over Svoronata, I can recommend this taverna.
We will definitely return when we are back in September.",Date of visit: May 2019,Koutoupas Paradise,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Love this taverna,"This is one of our favourite tavernas to visit when we are in Svoronata.
Either a breakfast, morning coffee, light lunch or an evening meal, this is one of our very favourite places to visit.
Fantastic friendly staff, lovely food in a lovely, peaceful position means you can't help but love this Taverna and I can't wait to visit again when we return to Kefalonia.
Would highly recommend this Taverna",Date of visit: May 2019,Dum Spiros Spero Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely meal,"We visited this Taverna on our last night, as it was their opening night.
We booked a table, which was just as well as after we arrived and seated the place became full very quickly.
We had 3 courses each and a litre of their house wine.
The food was delicious and the main of sole wrapped in bacon was gorgeous.
For afters we had chocolate brownie and their orange cake, which is made from their own orange grove, and both were very tasty.
The service was very friendly and the whole evening was a lovely, relaxing experience.
We can""t wait to go back when we return in September.",Date of visit: May 2019,Esperides,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
60th Birthday party,"I have recently celebrated my 60th birthday at the Briardene Hotel.
From booking the function through to the evening everything was exceptional.
The staff are superb, friendly and very professional in everything they do.
They catered for all our needs and adjusted their menu to suit everything we asked.
On the night the food was excellent and all the guests commented how good it was.
Fabulous food, in fabulous surroundings and with lovely, friendly staff made it a very special occasion.
Thanks to all for making it such a memorable night.
Can't wait to come back to sample more of your lovely food!!",Date of stay: April 2019,Briardene Hotel,4,"Thornton Cleveleys, United Kingdom"
Lovely taverna,"Visited this Taverna twice while recently staying in Svoronata.
Lovely setting overlooking the sea and great views of the sunset.
The food was always delicious and the service was friendly.
Will be one of the first places we visit when we return in September.",Date of visit: May 2019,La Tavolata,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Another great day,"This was our second trip with Antonia & Mixalis after enjoying our first trip so much.
As it was early May the weather was unpredictable and our original trip had to be cancelled due to bad weather. However Antonia made sure we were re-booked in and had our trip. They will not travel if they think their customers will not enjoy the experience.
We were provided with cheese pie and Greek coffee before we set sail at 8am.
We set sail to the nets that were laid the previous night and then watched as they landed a great variety of sea life.
Once the nets were hauled in we sailed to a beautiful secluded area where we stopped for a relax and if brave enough a swim (the sea is still cold at the moment, but some brave souls did go in)
While we relax, Antonia and Mixalis cook the fish they have just caught, along with salad, potatoes and their own wine.
The food is plentiful, you won't go hungry and delicious.
After a leisurely lunch and relax, they then return you to the harbour, with a full stomach and beautiful new made friends.
We had such a lovely day with Antonia, Mixalis and the other guests and can not wait to return in September for our third trip.
If you are looking for something a little different and also great for kids, give this trip a try.",Date of experience: May 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely meal,"We visited The Mousetrap for our anniversary meal.
When we arrived we were quickly seated and our orders taken..
The service was friendly and attentive. We had 3 courses and all of them were excellent.
We had the duck for our main course and it was delicious.
The sweets were also excellent and very tasty.
The whole meal was delicious in a lovely and friendly setting.
The only tiny complaint was the the portions could have been larger as we wanted more of the lovely food.
Would definitely eat here again if we were in the area.",Date of visit: September 2018,The Mousetrap Inn Restaurant,4,"Bourton-on-the-Water, United Kingdom"
Loved this guest house,"We booked the Lansdowne for our anniversary for 3 nights. It has recently been taken over by Gemma and we loved everything about it.
When we arrived we were met by Barry who was extremely friendly and polite and he gave us some information on the area before showing us to our room.
The room was clean and spacious with plenty of storage and the bed was large and very comfortable.
When we arrived in the room Gemma had placed a gorgeous bunch of flowers for our anniversary, which was a lovely gesture and was a great start to our stay.
The breakfast is served in a lovely dining room and the choice is very good, with a choice of cereals, fruit, cold meats, cheese and a variety of breads. Tea, coffee and toast are offered and that is followed by a further choice of hot meals.
The quality of the food was excellent and cooked perfectly and served by friendly and pleasant staff.
They were happy to go that little bit extra to ensure you had a great stay.
Loved everything about our stay and just wish it was for longer.
Would definitely stay there again if we visit the Cotswolds in the future.
Thanks to Gemma, Barry and all the staff for making our anniversary a memorable and very enjoyable one.",Date of stay: September 2018,The Lansdowne Guest House,4,"Bourton-on-the-Water, United Kingdom"
Great taverna,"A lovely traditional Taverna. The staff are very friendly and accomadating. The food is always good, fresh and tasty and Phillip will always go that little extra to try to make your experience a pleasant one, which it always is.
One of our favourites and first stop when we reach Svoronata.",Date of visit: September 2018,La Calma,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fabulous Fishing Trip,"We booked this trip after reading many reviews.
We met at 8.00am and boarded the boat.
Once we had set sail we were served cake and coffee, which was very nice and a good start to the day.
We then travelled to where they had laid their nets the previous night and they started to bring the nets in. Apparently there was 3km of nets that they hauled in.
We sat and watched a whole variety of sea life being landed, which was fascinating.
Once the nets had been hauled in and all the fish landed, we travelled to a small beach which can only be reached by water. We anchored up and spent time swimming in the sea and relaxing on the beach, while Antonia & Michalis prepared and cooked the fish they had just cooked.
The food was served up with wine and was delicious. You can't get fresher!
There was then time for another swim if you wanted, before setting back off to the port and home.
It was a great day spent with an absolutely gorgeous, friendly family who work so hard to make this a special day.
Would definitely recommend this trip if visiting Kefalonia.",Date of experience: September 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great Hotel,"We have just returned from a 2 week holiday at the Astra Village Hotel.
We loved everything about this hotel.
The check in was quick, friendly and efficient. Once we reached the room we were pleasantly surprised. It was spacious, well laid out and very clean, with lovely views from the balcony.
The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times, a special mention for Chris behind the bar who was excellent.
Breakfast is served around the swimming pool. There was a varied choice of hot and cold foods and all was good.
We did not eat in the restaurant, so can't comment on the meals but other guests seemed to enjoy them.
The hotel is in a lovely raised position, giving views over the Ammes Beach, airport runway, which is not a problem and behind over the mountains.
I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and we are just about to re-book again foe next year.",Date of stay: September 2018,Astra Village Hotel & Suites,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Budget hotel,"We stayed at St George's for 2 nights while staying in London.
The location is good and close to the rail and tube stations.
The hotel is definitely a budget hotel and is fairly tired and in need of some updating. The stairs to the rooms are steep and not suitable if you have mobility problems, although they do state this on their website. Continental breakfast is served in the basement, which can get a little cramped at busy times. You can have a cooked breakfast for an additional £5.00; but we didnt try this.
The room we stayed in was small and very basic and certainly needed updating, with poor furniture and a small and basic bathroom.
If you are looking for a budget hotel in a good location for getting around London, then have a look, however we would not personally stay here again.",Date of stay: April 2018,OYO St George Hotel,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Great Find,"We visited this restaurant while visiting London as a surprise for the brother in laws birthday.
We arrived 10 minutes early (7.50pm) and the place was packed. We were greeted & temporarily seated until our table was available.
Once our table was ready the service was quick and extremely friendly.
The food was excellent and very tasty served by polite and attentive staff.
After the meal we were provided with complimentary drinks and when Imran found out it was the BIL's birthday he arranged for a sweet with a Roman candle in it, a nice touch
All in all a great experience, lovely food, great service and will definitely be back if we visit this area again my!",Date of visit: March 2018,Memories of India Kensington,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Good fun,"We booked this as a surprise anniversary present for the sister and brother in law while visiting London.
Once we arrived we were greeted at The World End pub as we entered and pointed towards The Bletchley. Once we entered we were greeted again and shown to our ""station"" and given our WW2 jackets. We were given a welcome drink in a metal mug, which was pleasant. We were given our first clue and must say we were useless, but it was great fun and the staff were never far away to lead you down the right path.
Once we had received our first cocktail we were then given our 2nd clue and worked through that to enable us to order our next round of drinks.
The whole night was relaxed and great fun in an unusual setting. The staff were really friendly and good fun.
Great way to spend a couple of hours in a friendly and unique atmosphere, would definitely return.",Date of experience: March 2018,The Bletchley,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Good experience,"We booked here for a preshow show meal as it was close to the theatre and we hadn't visited for a few years.
When we arrived we were greeted and sat down straight away. We were given a menu and ordered drinks.
We both chose the steak and we both really enjoyed the meal. We followed it with a sweet which was also very enjoyable.
All the staff were friendly and made it a nice atmosphere to spend time there.
An enjoyable experience and we will visit again.",Date of visit: October 2016,West Coast Rock Cafe,4,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
Enjoyable experience,"We visited this restaurant last week for the first time. When we arrived we were greeted and seated straight away. The restaurant is basic but cosy and the staff were pleasant and attentive.
We had starters and a main. We thought the starters were a bit small for the price, but tasty. The main was absolutely gorgeous and extremely tasty. We also had a bottle of house wine (£12.00) which was nice enough.
We were well looked after and certainly not rushed.
All in all an enjoyable experience and we will go back for another visit soon.",Date of visit: July 2015,Amore Italian Restaurant,4,"Thornton Cleveleys, United Kingdom"
Another special holiday,"We have just returned from holiday at the Seaside Beach Hotel. This was our 5th time staying at this hotel, which tells you how much we love it. Once again we had the best time there. The family are amazing and treat you superbly. They want to make sure you relax and enjoy your stay and nothing is too much trouble for them. All the staff are also superb and very friendly.
The rooms were clean and comfortable and we had a nice sea view with a room on the front of the hotel. These rooms are smaller and would suggest if you want a bigger room, to book one round the pool at the rear of the hotel
We also ate in the hotel restaurant, which was as good as ever.
We love this hotel, family and staff and it never fails to deliver everything you want on a holiday.
Only been home a week and we have re-booked for May.
Can""t wait to get back to see everyone again and get spoiled rotten!",Date of stay: August 2014,Seaside Beach Hotel,4,"Santorini, Greece"
"Great presentation, not so great food","We have been to Kamari several times but have never tried The Almira. After reading all the excellent reviews we decided to give it a try and was looking forward to a beautiful meal.
When we arrived there was a huge party there, a good sign we thought. We just about got seated by the waiter.
The service was ok considering how busy they were.
There were 5 of us and 4 of us had a starter. The main comment was ""Bland""
We all ordered different main courses. When the food was served it looked superb and was beautifully presented. I had the lamb shank and was looking forward to it. Although the meat was very tender, again it was extremely bland with no taste.
I don't know if we were unlucky because it was so busy, but it definitely didn't live up to the previous reviews I have read.
May give it another chance when we go back, but in no rush really.",Date of visit: September 2013,Almira Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Outstanding Hotel,"We have just returned from our holiday at The Seaside Beach Hotel in Kamari. It was the fourth time we have stayed here and it continually improves each time we stay there.
The new seating area around the bar is a massive improvement and is a lovely place to chill and spend an afternoon or evening watching the world go by.
We stayed in the front of the hotel this year for our first time. Although the rooms are much smaller than at the rear, they are fully modernised and as always immaculate, with the added bonus of a balcony with a view.
The family are as amazing as always and their hospitality is fantastic. We were treated to a feast one day which they put on for about 25 of us, who had stayed there several times. The food and drinks supplied were amazing and a lovely gesture.
The hotel is kept immaculately clean by a team of fantastic cleaners and the exceptional waiters who are more like friends. If for any reason you do have a complaint (which we didn't) they make sure that it is put right as soon as possible and they will do all they can to fulfil any requests you may have.
The pool area is round the back of the hotel, giving you much more privacy than a lot of the hotels, which have the pools at the front and it is right on the beach, with sun loungers available for €5 for 2 umbrella's and a table for the day.
They also have an excellent restaurant which serves beautiful food.
All round an excellent, relaxing holiday surrounded by lovely attentive people and we can not wait to go back next year.",Date of stay: September 2013,Seaside Beach Hotel,4,"Santorini, Greece"
"Good food, good service","We have just returned from our holiday in Kamari.
We decided to try the Kiwi Chinese Restaurant for a change from the Greek cuisine. When we arrived we were greeted by the friendly waiter and seated immediately.
The service was excellent and we were looked after very well. There were 5 of us and we all ordered various choices off the plentiful menu. All the food was cooked well and was very tasty.
The price was very reasonable for the portion sizes we received.
Sat in a nice setting, excellent service, excellent food and reasonable prices, what more can you ask?",Date of visit: September 2013,Kiwi,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Excellent food & service,"We have recently stayed at the Seaside Beach Hotel and while there we frequently used their excellent restaurant.
From being greeted & seated by one of the friendly waiters to leaving with very full belly's it is a wonderful experience.
The food is all freshly prepared and beautifully presented. If you have any complaints about anything (which we didn't) please let them know as they pride themselves on fantastic service and also like to put things right to ensure you have an enjoyable meal and overall experience.
One of my very favourite places to eat in Kamari and there are many to choose from, they will also do their best to satisfy any requests for items that are not shown on the menu, if requested.
Can't wait to go back next year.",Date of visit: September 2013,Sea Side Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Birthday Celebration,"My wife & I have just returned from this hotel, where we stayed for a Sunday & Monday night to celebrate our joint birthday.
We actually got the special offer price of £29.00 per night. This is excellent value for the experience we had.
The hotel is well situated, a 15-20 minutes stroll in to the middle of Manchester and ideal for the bars and restaurants around the Deansgate Locks and a decent sized car park if you are driving there.
The reception and booking in was friendly and efficient. Our room was basic, but spacious and clean with everything we needed for a short break.
The bar is small but nice enough with pleasant service.
We did not use the restaurant, but again looked nice enough.
The only slight complaint we can make is the ""early morning alarm"" we got when the guests in the room above were getting ready at 5.00am. The creaky floorboards made it sound like they were about to come through the ceiling, which went on for about an hour.
Although we enjoyed the hotel overall, we would not stay there if we had to pay the full prices of £80-100 for a Saturday night, but at the offer price of £29.00 it is excellent value for your money.",Date of stay: April 2013,Premier Inn Manchester City Centre (Deansgate Locks) hotel,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Birthday Meal,"We went to Albert's Shed to celebrate our joint birthday. The setting is really nice in Deansgate Locks.
We were welcomed as we walked in and shown straight to a table. Although we didn't make a reservation, I would definitely advise booking at weekends, as it was quite busy on a Monday night.
The restaurant is very pleasant and the staff were very friendly and efficient.
We had 3 courses each, which were all excellent, with a bottle of wine and the bill totalled £75.00. The whole experience was very enjoyable and look forward to using this restaurant again, when we stay in Manchester.",Date of visit: April 2013,Albert's Shed,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Good traditional food,"We have just returned from Cyprus and while there we visited Melania Restaurant. The food we had was excellent. The Moussaka one of our party had was huge and delicious. We also had chicken, lamb chops and the kleftiko. All main courses were tasty and well cooked. There were also plenty of salad and veg supplied and a big plate of freshly cooked chips, made from their own organic potatoes. We also had their own red and white wine which was very nice. It was such a nice change to eat good fresh traditional food, rather than the normal typical English food served at a lot of the other establishments. The surroundings were very nice under the vines and the family who own Melania's are very friendly and the service was excellent. Will certainaly be back if we return to Cyprus.",Date of visit: May 2012,Melania Restaurant,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
Good value meals,"Great value meals served in very pleasant surroundings. We decided to go for the 3 course meal for €12.50 each. We were not expecting too much for that price, but we got 3 lovely courses with a glass of wine and a brandy to finish off with. The food was tasty and good portions, with pleasant staff serving you.",Date of visit: May 2012,Camares Cafe Bar Restaurant,4,"Paphos, Cyprus"
As good as ever,"We have just returned from our holiday in Santorini, where we once again stayed at The Seaside Beach Hotel. This was the second time we have stayed here and once again it did not dissapoint. The service was superb, looked after like we were family by all the family and staff. I fell ill during the trip and Manos called out the doctor, who turned up within 20 minutes, checked me over and prescibed drugs to take (try that in England). Everyone makes sure you have the most relaxing, enjoyable time and nothing is too much trouble for them. Once again we came away looking forward to booking again for next year, the countdown has started.",Date of stay: September 2010,Seaside Beach Hotel,4,"Santorini, Greece"
As good as ever,"We have just returned from our holiday in Kamari, where we stayed at The Sea Side Beach Hotel again. There were 10 of us in the party and before we left we had decided to try various tavernas this year. However once again this never happened as we could not fault the delicious traditional Greek food we were served, by the superb staff as usual. The Seaside is a traditional Greek restaurant and the standard was excellent as always. There wasn't one person who had any complaint for the 2 weeks we were there and when it was suggested we eat somewhere else, we always ended up staying at the Sea Side.
Excellent food & excellent service from the 2 Nikos's, Manos, George and the rest of the staff.
Thanks for making our holiday very special once again. Can't wait to get back there next year!!",,Sea Side Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Incredible Experience,"We have just returned from the most amazing 2 weeks holiday in Santorini and more to the point, The Seaside Hotel.
We had our wedding reception at the hotel last year and some of the guests stayed there, but this was the first time we had actually stayed at the Seaside. They were fantastic last year with all the wedding details but I think they even surpassed that this year.
From being picked up at the airport by Manos and his friend to being taken back to the airport by George, all 5 of us in his car and fully loaded with cases and him laughing all the way ""You are sardines yes?"" (Great memories)
The hotel is perfectly situated, on the beach but at the quieter end of Kamari. It is spotless and the rooms are cleaned daily. George, Evie, Manos, Nikos & all the staff are exceptional. We were looked after like one of the family. Nikos even treated us to a fish feast one night courtesy of The Seaside. Mussel saganaki, Grouper in lemon and honey sauce (superb) and snapper with vegetables and drinks for 5 of us, all on the family.
The breakfast is basic but enough (especially after a heavy night in The Love Boat) and the food in the restaurant is excellent.
Over the fortnight in the end there were 10 of us together and for some, it was there first time in Santorini. Needless to say they loved everything about the place and are keen to return next year. We were going to try somewhere different next year, but after being treated so well and looked after like royalty we have decided we are all going back again next year.
We can't wait to get back to this wonderful hotel and exceptional family.",Date of stay: September 2009,Seaside Beach Hotel,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Not the best,"We stayed here for 2 weeks in September 08. We were getting married in Santorini and asked if we could have a room large enough for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready. When we arrived there in the early hours of the morning we were met by the night porter, who didn't seem too happy at being disturbed.
After booking in, he showed us to our room. To say we were dissapointed is an understatement. The room was dark, damp & smelt and was very close to the kichen and the noise of crashing and banging was appalling. When we opened the doors we were looking onto a small childrens playground.
We requested another room, which wasn't really a problem for the hotel, but we had to wait for one to be prepared and were told to leave our luggage in reception and they would take it to our room when it was ready. We went for a walk around Kamari and to meet up with friends. When we returned to the hotel we were told our room was ready.
The room was an improvement but certainaly not the best we have ever seen. We have stayed in Santorini before and we are quite aware that rooms are basic, which is fine. However the second room was not the cleanest we have ever stayed in.
Tha buffet breakfast was adequate. The service at the pool bar was good and the staff were pleasant. The pool itself was huge.
Even though the hotel didn't ruin our stay there, we would not book there again.",Date of stay: September 2008,Kamari Beach Hotel,4,"Santorini, Greece"
