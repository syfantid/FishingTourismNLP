An experience not to be missed!!!,"We had a wonderful day with Alfonso guiding us through the amazing Caminito del Rey. First thought of doing it ourselves. Then, after reading more of this almost 8 km path, wondered if I can manage it at all... I'm glad we did it, and chose Alfonso as our guide. Doing it in a small group is definitely recommended! Alfonso's perfect timing, yet relaxed and sensitive attitude, good humor, interesting information and stories of past history, flora, fauna and geology of the region made it even more special. And without his expertise we might have missed Caminito that day altogether. Either by missing the entrance time slot, or by queuing for the tickets or toilet (long lines, awful facilities before and after the Caminito), or by stopping too long to take pictures. Namely the path was closed that day soon after we had gone thru, due to heavy winds.",Date of experience: October 2019,Caminito del Rey Tour from Malaga (Small Group) with picnic,4,"Malaga, Spain"
"Great location, view and history","The bar, as well as the whole Hotel Torni, will be closed for renovations until at least beginning of 2021.
Hopefully they will honor the unique character of this Helsinki landmark hotel.",Date of experience: September 2019,Ateljee Bar,4,"Helsinki, Finland"
Tällaista on Tapiolaan kaivattukin!,"Ihana, maukas (innovatiivinen, muttei liian hifistelevä) ruoka. Hyvä hinta-laatusuhde ja sopivan kokoiset, nälän vievät annokset. Luonteva hyvä palvelu. Sijainti uuden Tapiolan Ainoan 3. kerroksessa.",Date of visit: December 2019,Bistro o Mat Tapiola,4,"Espoo, Finland"
"Nice statue, nice garden","This is a statue of a young man selling Biznagas. We were told that Biznagas, flowers with very nice fragrance, were a symbol of Malaga. The park, Jardines de Pedro Luis Alonso, is next to Malaga city hall. Beautiful roses, citrus trees, lotus flowers in a pond. You can see the gardens also from above from Alcazaba.",Date of experience: October 2019,Escultura del Biznaguero,4,"Malaga, Spain"
Amazing collection of an amazing lady,"The top floor was closed when we visited second time in October, but the collection of art is still over-whelming.",Date of experience: October 2019,Museo Carmen Thyssen Malaga,4,"Malaga, Spain"
Have a seat by Picasso,"Nice, lively square, where you can sit on a bench next to (the statue of) Picasso, in front of the house where he was born. Many bars, cafeterias and restaurants next to that house. Live musicians too.

The atmosphere is somewhat disturbed by the building and renovation works in the houses around the square - looks like many of them have already been diverted to tourist rental apartments...",Date of experience: October 2019,Plaza de la Merced,4,"Malaga, Spain"
Not what it looks in the outside,"Red bricks in the outside - with the picture of the two patron saints of the city, San Ciriaco and Santa Paula next to the entrance. But do step in to feel the atmosphere that makes a person humble, to understand the past and present, and to admire the wealth of the artwork and ornaments.",Date of experience: October 2019,Iglesia de Los Martires,4,"Malaga, Spain"
Leisurely promenade,"Paseo del Muelle Uno is a sunny leisurely promenade right by the sea, with (lots of) tourists and locals of all ages (especially during weekends) alike. Some shops, many bars and restaurants with outdoor terraces, street artists. Sight-seeing boats leave from here, and on Sunday afternoon when we visited there was a nice market here, close to Centre Pompidou.",Date of experience: October 2019,Puerto de Malaga,4,"Malaga, Spain"
Pedestrian street worth a stroll,"If not the best street for shopping to my opinion, Calle Larios is a nice, marble-paved street to absorb the atmosphere and architecture of the city. Whenever there is a festival in the city, this street has special decoration. For shopping I prefer the small streets in historic centre, around Calle Larios.",Date of experience: October 2019,La Calle Larios,4,"Malaga, Spain"
One of the symbols of Malaga,"Definitely worth a visit. Fortification with Moorish architecture, you can feel the history and cultural roots of Malaga from the time of Arab rule. The sea level at that time used to be up to here. You can enter after coming down from Gibralfaro, or take a lift up from around the corner from the Roman Theatre. Nice small, shady bar/cafeteria up there with a view.",Date of experience: October 2019,Alcazaba,4,"Malaga, Spain"
A cool oasis in city center,"This lovely park with plants, fountains and trees from all continents gives a wonderful shade on a hot sunny day - in the city center, close to the see. It was planted during 1920-1926 by the order of Marquise Lariot.",Date of experience: October 2019,Parque de Malaga,4,"Malaga, Spain"
Wonderful view and history,"Check out the history in advance, wear good walking shoes, take a taxi or bus 35 (or Hop-on-hop-off sight-seeing route) up, enjoy the view and walk down. Save more time for Alcazaba.",Date of experience: October 2019,Mirador del Gibralfaro,4,"Malaga, Spain"

"Amazing atmosphere, food, service, location!","What a find! On a small street Calle Santa Maria, right off the Constitution Square, this small restaurant was founded in 1852. Small, traditional tapas bar downstairs, old characteristic dining room, decorated with art and music instruments upstairs. Our party of 8 had a fantastic late lunch: tapas, main course, home-made dessert - and the upstairs like a private dining room! The experience was topped with smiling, super sweet, excellent service.",Date of visit: October 2019,Bar Malaga Restaurante,4,"Malaga, Spain"
A bargain,"Nothing fancy, but simple, fresh, tasty, home-cooked like lunch for 8 EUR. And that is including a drink and a choice of starter, salad, main course and dessert. Friendly and fast service, also in English.",Date of visit: April 2019,Restaurante la Biznaga,4,"Rincon de la Victoria, Spain"
Simply fabulous!,"Excellent value and ambiance. Delicious food, not only sea-food and fish that are wonderful in so many restaurants here, but steaks too. If you sit in the bar, you can see to the kitchen, and it is fun to watch the busy, efficient chefs.

Also the waiters and waitress do a fantastic job with a big heart. Antonio and his staff make everybody feel like a valued guest in the friend's house.

If you want to secure a table, go early, or book in advance. The place is busy with locals from 9 pm on, especially during weekends.",Date of visit: April 2019,La Vina De Antonio,4,"Rincon de la Victoria, Spain"
Right on the beach,"Late lunch on a sunny day in April. The empty beach and the sea right in front of us - not bad. The espetos, sardines grilled on open fire, were tasty, so was the rosé wine. A bit slow service and the fast-food feel did not spoil the relaxed atmosphere.",Date of visit: April 2019,Aqui TE Espero,4,"Rincon de la Victoria, Spain"
Authentic local culture and atmosphere,"Pena Flamenca El Piyayo was close to our apartment in Rincon de la Victoria, and we wanted to visit, as it sounded as very authentic, very local, non-touristy. And we certainly were not disappointed!

We had wine and tapas with the locals, we were the only tourists there, and nicely welcomed by a gentleman who spoke English, and explained the program of the evening to us.

This club and association was established in the 1980's to keep up and cherish the Flamenca culture. The night we visited they had semi-finals of an annual contest for young flamenca singers. Such passion, such talent! And the guitarist accompanied them all - wow! We enjoyed a lot!",Date of experience: April 2019,Peña Flamenca El Piyayo,4,"Rincon de la Victoria, Spain"
The only of its kind in Europe,"Fascinating formations, interesting history. It was rather quiet in April, which was nice. We also appreciated the audio guide. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.

Nice (new) big restaurant right opposite to Cueva del Tesoro, with good food and amazing views of the coastline from the upstairs terrace bar.",Date of experience: April 2019,Cueva del Tesoro,4,"Rincon de la Victoria, Spain"
"Great service, wonderful tapas","There are two Antonio's on the same street. This one is smaller, both are wonderful, and became our favorites in Rincon. We came early, sat out on the terrace, enjoyed delicious tapas, and admired how the waiter created such nice atmosphere with his efficient, yet easy-going, friendly, smiling service, as the the place got busy with locals.

When we got home in Finland, I tried to copy their timbal de foie con queso de cabra y mermelada de frutas del bosque (see picture on their Facebook) - my guests liked it, but it was not as good as at Antonio's - have to go back to Rincon de la Victoria for it!",Date of visit: April 2019,Casa Antonio Tapas,4,"Rincon de la Victoria, Spain"
Ruusuja ja appelsiinintuoksua,"Tämä ihana pieni puisto kaupungintalon vieressä lienee upeimmillaan huhtikuusta eteen päin, kun ruusut kukkivat. Maaliskuussa appelsiinintuoksuiset kujat, hyvin hoidetut geometriset pensasistutukset, kauniit lammet, solisevat suihkulähteet ja maurilaisvaikutteiset seinämät loivat ainutlaatuisen tunnelman - keskellä kuhisevaa kaupunkia.

Gibralfaron sisäänkäynti ja roomalainen teatteri ovat kaupungintalon takaa kävellen kulman takana. Toisella puolen katua satamaan päin on Malagan kaupunginpuisto, kaunis ja rauhoittava sekin trooppisine istutuksineen.",Date of experience: March 2019,Jardines de Pedro Luis Alonso,4,"Malaga, Spain"
"Nice, easy ride, great views of Funchal from above","We took the bus up to Monte, visited the gardens and rode the Cable car down. No rush in January. Nice, easy ride, ending close to the historical centre.",Date of experience: January 2019,Telefericos da Madeira,4,"Madeira, Portugal"
Would like to give 5+,"This small, new restaurant was recommended to us by a local. Normally we prefer to explore and experience different tastes and atmospheres during our travels, but the fantastic lunch we had, made us return for dinner during the one week stay in Funchal.

Easy, relaxed, yet trendy atmosphere, smiling, no-fuss service. Creative, nicely presented, fresh, different, simply soooo delicious food!! Not cheap, but excellent value.

Location in the centre, close to the Cathedral and Sugar museum, within a short walk from the Marina. It was filling up fast both for lunch and for dinner.",Date of visit: January 2019,Kampo by Chef Julio Pereira,4,"Madeira, Portugal"
"Cozy atmosphere, excellent value","We chose this tiny, authentic Italian for a pre-theatre dinner, and it was perfect!
It is a short walk from Lahti City Theatre, the service was friendly and prompt, and the food was very tasty: prepared with true Italian passion for cooking, nice size portions, excellent value. Good house wine too.",Date of visit: September 2017,Ristorante Pulcinella,4,"Lahti, Finland"
Delightful surprise,"Do not let the concrete architecture from the 60's fool you. Inside the building is functional and pleasant. Check what's on, and pay a visit. We went to see a musical Love Me Tender on Juhani stage, and were very pleasantly surprised of the all-round quality of the performance. Better than many I've seen in Helsinki - or even in London or New York.

Enjoyed the live music, stageing, brilliant coreography, original ideas of the director, and the positive energy of all the actors.",Date of experience: September 2017,Lahti City Theatre,4,"Lahti, Finland"
An oasis up-hill from the Gouvia tourist area,"What a relaxed holiday! Plenty of space in the beautifully tended, peaceful garden to place your sun-bed under an old olive tree, next to the lovely flowers, or by the good-size pool. Excellent breakfast buffet with Greek and international options. Good service and delicious Greek food at the pool-side restaurant - also for dinner.

The room was simple, but very clean and quiet, good size, with good air-conditioning, small kitchenette, powerful shower, plenty of space to hang your clothes.

The pleasant walk down-hill to Gouvia village took us some 15 min. The bus stop to Corfu Town is about mid-way. Do take the bus or a taxi to Corfu town - unless you prefer to spend the day, among all others, circling the narrow streets looking for a spot to park your car.

From arrival to departure we did not stop to admire the hotel garden, and the amazing, always smiling and genuine hospitality and attitude of the staff - better than at 5-star hotels! No wonder this family-run hotel has many repeat clients. It is excellent value for money, and has a good location to explore the island - or to stay relaxed right there.",Date of stay: June 2017,Saint Nicholas Hotel,4,"Corfu, Greece"
"Amazing, authentic, relaxing day on Kefalonian fishing boat","I fully agree with the previous reviews! The day out on the see on a traditional wooden fishing boat, with the most hospitable and warm-hearted family and crew of Captain Michalis, was very special.

No tourist jargon or party boat hassle, but Michalis, Antonia and Niki let us be part of their family for a day, sharing an experience and information way beyond any normal tour we have been on.

The refreshing swim, and delicious lunch made on board of the fish we caught, and of the fresh vegetables from their garden, and Antonia's yammy cake and dessert topped it all.

We were 6 adults on the boat - had plenty of space to move around - but also for families with children this is fun. See their website, call or send a message to Antonia, she speaks perfect English, and replies soon.",Date of experience: June 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Nice waves,"Nice sandy beach with good waves. close to the airport. Sunbeds, umbrellas and and shower, but no toilet, kiosk or cafeteria (in Jun 2017)",Date of experience: June 2017,Ammes Beach,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Fun experience, great food for every taste","Not a quiet, sophisticated restaurant, but a very lively place where you can see and meet locals and visitors alike. Take time to walk around, and choose on your plate some of the best cooking of the local restaurants.

For dinner go early, as the place gets busy. It is a pity if you are not hungry, but you can also just have an ice-cream, coffee and pasty, or a glass of wine and enjoy the atmosphere.",Date of experience: October 2016,Time Out Market Lisboa,4,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Fun and informative way to see and tour Lisbon!,"This is a must in Lisbon! The best way to tour this city with narrow cobble-stone streets and beautiful sceneries from high-up hills.

We were party of 8 and booked two tuk tuks. Some of us had been on a normal sight-seeing tour on previous visit, but we all equally enjoyed the Tuk Tuk experience.
Our fondest regards and thanks especially to the young lady guide (Helena?), she was absolutely fantastic!",Date of experience: October 2016,Tuk Tuk Tejo,4,"Lisbon, Portugal"
"Excellent dinner, great service, multi-cultural atmosphere","Don't come here if it is only a hamburger you are after - wait until you are really hungry, and ready for culinary expedition. Caverna is not only a restaurant, it is a delightful journey! We went there after reading of the wonderful Brazilian churrasco skewers. Yes, they were absolutely delicious, grilled and spiced to perfection, especially beef and home-made sausage.

But before getting to the grilled meat, we sampled the delights from the buffets: great sushi, peking duck, salads, dumplings, tiger prawns, tastes from Mexico... decided to save the teppanyaki buffet for next time! The dessert buffet had a choice from cheese, fresh fruit, ice cream, cheese cake to the chocolate fountain. Everything was very fresh, tasty and nicely laid out. And all this for EUR 38. Had a look at the à la carte also, but the buffets (including churrasco and teppanyaki) are definately better value.

The service was very friendly and attentive. Thank you Johnny and Eduardo!

The place is big, so it is great also for groups and families with different tastes. Location is right in the city centre, a short walk from both the Senate Square and the Railway Station. They also rent a private room with karakoke :)",Date of visit: November 2016,Caverna Restaurant,4,"Helsinki, Finland"
"Perfect location for exploring Lisbon. Spacious, spotless, friendly","We were four couples enjoying our stay in two 2-room apartmens for two nights. We would have happily stayed longer! I can fully agree with previous reviews praising the location, style, space, facilities and service. Catarina was so nice and helpful, and all communication already before our trip was smooth and prompt.
Rua do Carmo is a pedestrian street from 10 am on, but arriving and departing before that, our Suntransfers driver got us to the door, and the rental cars were delivered right there.
We appreciated also the possibility to leave our luggage before check-in time, the refreshing welcome water and coffee, the view, the convenience, the local feel and good sleep. Yes, there were people on the street on Friday night, but it was not too noisy.
Do not miss the fabulous view from the neighbouring restaurant terrace, when you exit from the top floor. But do not count on having breakfast there. At Nicole's on Rossio square we got great service and a very good breakfast. There are also two supermarkets withing a short walk, if you prefer to cook yourself.",Date of stay: October 2016,DesignChaiado Flats,4,"Lisbon, Portugal"
"Super service, very convenient","We were four couples travelling with luggage from Lisbon airport to our apartment in Chiado, Lisbon centre. I'm so happy we pre-ordered the transfer with a mini-van with Suntransfers. Not only was it saving time and well worth the money spent, but our driver was extremely nice. He gave us lots of valuable information on the way, and an insight to the city - all in the very pleasant manner. He even phoned the apartment owners for us, as we arrived a bit earlier than expected. What a nice welcome!",Date of experience: October 2016,Suntransfers,4,"Barcelona, Spain"
Close to the nature -with a modern twist,"The Finns love their lakes, forests, sauna... Here you can have a leisurly day out like a local, be it winter or summer. The beautiful winding country road leading to Oittaa sets you already to the right mood. Especially in the summer the place is busy with families, as in addition to the sandy beach, there is also a nice small activity field for the kids. You can rent sporting equipent, like small boats and supping boards in the summer, and cross country skis and shoes in the winter. You can even try winter swimming after enjoying the lake-side sauna.
The cafeteria and restaurant serve refreshments and a nice buffet lunch.",Date of experience: June 2016,Oittaa Recreation Centre,4,"Espoo, Finland"
"Central location, interesting food","Central location at Erottaja, start of Mannerheimintie, Bulevardi and the Esplanades. We had dinner before a concert at the Swedish Theatre, right opposite to Pastor.
Interesting fusion menu, very fresh, very tasty. And the atmosphere is nice and relaxed.",Date of visit: October 2015,Pastor Restaurant,4,"Helsinki, Finland"
Perfect grilled octopus!,"... which was a surprise, especially in Finland, as the restaurant had more of a relaxed burger place feel. The steak and the burger were also very good, but the langoustine far over-priced. Friendly smiling service made up for the longish wait for meal.",Date of visit: August 2016,The Mess,4,"Helsinki, Finland"
Simply fabulous!,"This family-run taverna is above Avithos beach, the higher up one of the two restaurants there. The food alone is worth the drive to Svoronata. We found it many years ago, and had superb lunch after a beach day. Ever since it has been one of our absolute favorites.

Were it lunch or dinner, the experience has always been fantastic. The food is always fresh, delicious, planned and prepared with passion. And if you have some room for dessert - yammy! Their medal-winning olive oil and own Sarres rose wine are both excellent, and you can also buy some to take home.

Panos and his team have a way of making you feel special. However busy they are, they have time for a warm welcome, smiling and attentive service. The beautiful view and relaxed atmosphere top it all.",Date of visit: July 2016,Avithos Preview Taverna,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Mediocre,"The food is nothing special, but check if they have live music.
The Main Square is like a living room for the locals, and it is nice to sit outdoors and feel to be part of it.",Date of visit: October 2015,La Gondola,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Lovely location, good service, great seafood","The small Fanari Road between Lassi and Argostoli is so nice, also for jogging or cycling!

The Vinaries restaurant on Fanari Road, closer to Argostoli, has tables under the pine trees, right by the turquoise sea. Parking and the main building are on the other side of the road.

We like to choose several small dishes to share. Their seafood is excellent, price slightly above average, service friendly and professional. Vinaries is favored also by the locals, so recommended to go early for dinner, also to admire the colors of the sunset.",Date of visit: July 2016,Vinaries,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Good value, modest setting","Patsouras taverna has moved again. The new location is on the I. Metaxata, by the fruit, fish and meat markets, almost opposite to Alpha Bank.

Simple setting,very basic traditional food, good service.",Date of visit: July 2016,Taverna Patsouras,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Kefalonian home-style cooking for lunch or take-away,"Big portions, fresh and tasty traditional cooking, great value. You will find mostly locals here for lunch. Go early, as they open at 12 noon, and close when the food prepared for the day is gone.",Date of visit: June 2016,Tzivras Restaurant 1933,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Nothing special,"Tourist place and prices in a nice location by the port. Slow, non-challant service. Maybe a drink on the way, but would not choose for a meal next time.",Date of visit: October 2015,Captain's Table Cafe Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Slow service spoiled the experience,"Premier used to be THE restaurant for great ice-cream.

Still the ice-cream was OK, but after we were efficiently thrown in, we were not able to get any service: waited for the menu, the staff was too busy to take our order (the place was half empty), it took ages for our dishes to arrive - and even more so for the bill.",Date of visit: October 2015,Premier Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
A Must stop when visiting Myrtos Beach,"We have been enjoying the delicious food and friendly service of AlexandrosTaverna for years now, every time we visit Myrtos Beach or pass by. Highly recommended!

There are two tavernas when you drive up from the beach. Alexandros is on the left, and their parking place is before the restaurant building.",Date of visit: June 2016,Alexandros Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Myrtos is beautiful!,"No, the pictures of Myrtos are not photo shopped. The real beauty of Myrtos is even more breath-taking than in the pictures. The white pebble stones, the rushing of the waves, the colour of the sea...

And do take your binoculars with you, to enjoy watching the goats roaming on the hill-side.",Date of experience: June 2016,Myrtos Beach,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Perfect for a leisurly break,"We chose the Marathon Beach Hotel when looking for a nice hotel within a short drive from Athens airport, as we came to meet our friends arriving with a late flight. Perfect choice, also for those wishing to escape from the heat in Athens. They have airport shuttle (at charge, contact the hotel directly), and free parking. Some 30-40 min. drive from Athens airport.

Good value at a promotional price from hotel website. If you are staying for more than one night, I recommend spending some more euros for the comfort and space of executive room with a large balcony and sea view - loved it! I think all the rooms have pool/garden view, though.

The rooms are completely renovated and styled recently. Very comfortable bed, more amenities than expected of a 3-star hotel, excellent air-con, well-stocked minibar, safety, hair-drier, bath robe and slippers. We missed only another bed-side reading lamp, and something to wipe the bathroom floor, all wet after shower.

The hotel salt water pool is great. The pool chairs were occupied, or reserved by towels, from early morning, but the pool attendant/safe guard kindly brought more loungers when needed.

We liked the Buffet breakfast served at the Pool Bar, always fresh until 10:30. There were basic hot, and many cold, sweet and salty choices, but the variety was the same for the three days we were there. Service was excellent, as all thru the hotel.

The staff is really great, always smiling and ready to assist, with a genuine service attitude. The few technical problems and minor issues we had were taken care of promptly and professionally.

The Pool Bar menu is worth trying. Prices are the same as in any cafeteria, but the quality is far better, absolutely delicious! For dinner there are many restaurants just around the corner, by the sea side, where also locals come for dinner. All three restaurants we tried were very good, also The Greek Recipe, which is the hotel restaurant.

Not much to see in the close vicinity, but we made a very enjoyable day trip to Marathon lake, the Archaeological Museum and Timvos Marathonos, easily combined, within a short drive from the hotel. Next time must try the massage at the hotel, and maybe a biking or a boat tour.",Date of stay: June 2016,Marathon Beach Resort,4,"Nea Makri, Greece"
"Good value, convenient for the port and beach","Basic, very clean and friendly family hotel - three generations offering warm Greek hospitality. We were two couples who missed the last ferry from Killini to Poros, Kefalonia. Hotel Ionion, close to the port, was perfect for our stay. The rooms are not new, but had all the amenities needed: good bed, shower, WiFi, air-condition, fridge, balcony and calm atmosphere.

Free parking right in front of the hotel, several restaurants, as well as the port, within a short walk. Nice beach with sunbeds right in front of the hotel. No breakfast, but that was OK, as we had breakfast at a cafeteria by the port - and the special farewell treat from Grandma's garden at Hotel Ionion was such a lovely gesture, and delicious!",Date of stay: June 2016,Hotel Ionion,4,"Kyllini, Greece"
Small and easy to find,"Much smaller port than Patras, easy to find. TIcket sales and small cafeteria at the port, more restaurants within a short walk.
A nice small beach with sunbeds within walking distance, in front of Hotel Ionian",Date of experience: June 2016,Port of Killini,4,"Kyllini, Greece"
"Fast, friendly, over-salty","Had salmon (mistake!) and Latin burger. Both, as well as the chips were totally over-salty, leaving the taste of poor cooking oil. The burger was rare instead of medium. Small side salad was fresh.

The two points are only for the quick and friendly service, the food gets zero.",Date of visit: April 2016,Funky Burger,4,"Espoo, Finland"
Apartment with Catalonian character,"We enjoyed very much our stay at the characteristic, spacious and clean apartment. Appreciated the two bathrooms, comfortable bed, excellent wardrobes to hang your clothes, kitchen with all we needed. It was fun to observe local life from the small balcony, stroll to the close-by market hall for fresh breakfast supplies, also a small supermarket, non-touristic cafeterias and some restaurants are within walking distance. Two metro stations are close by.",Date of stay: November 2015,Aspasios Fuster Apartments,4,"Barcelona, Spain"
Highlight of our visit!,"Fantastic concert in this stunningly beautiful theatre was the highlight of our visit. Definitely worth while to check what they have on, get tickets in andvance and arrive early to absorbe the beauty and atmosphere. Good location too on La Rambla to enjoy a before or after performance drink at one of the outdoor restaurants.",Date of experience: November 2015,Gran Teatre del Liceu,4,"Barcelona, Spain"
Unique,"Very touristic but definately interesting, and a must see in Barcelona. We visited off-season and still it was busy with visitors. Prepare with good walking shoes, water and patience.",Date of experience: November 2015,Parc Guell,4,"Barcelona, Spain"
No stress!,"We had a relaxing stay in a superior bungalow. Very clean, rather compact, good bed, aircon and shower. Surprisingly we did not mind that there was no WiFi in the room.

The location was quite good by the beach, the town and some restaurants within walking distance. Taken that all services needed could be found at the hotel.

We were rather skeptic about all-inclusive, but it worked OK for a week. The selection and quality of buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner was good. The atmosphere could be made nicer with some soft local music and less canteen-like seating. The a la carte restaurant was only a bit more sophisticated. One dinner there is included, remember to make a reservation.

The animation team is great - very talented dancers, and friendly, smiling staff organizing all kinds of sports and children's activities.

We can also recommend the massage which was great and good value.",Date of stay: February 2016,Oasis Atlantico Belorizonte,4,"Ilha do Sal, Cape Verde"
"Great location, delicious brunch","We were here for family brunch. Easy with kids, and good value. Everything was fresh and great for all tastes (vegetarian, meat-lovers, sweet-teeth, hungry and not so hungry). Included also season's specialities.

Good location by the sea, do visit also the old market hall opposite, and the close-by open market.",Date of visit: March 2016,Block by Dylan,4,"Helsinki, Finland"

Lively Oittaa by the lake,"Nice to see this lake-side recreation centre refreshed, clean and busy!

Had a good value home-cooked lunch in the cafeteria.",Date of experience: July 2015,Oittaa Recreation Centre,4,"Espoo, Finland"
"Fresh, organic, different: well worth a drive to Lakithra village!","During the many times we have visited beautiful Kefalonia, we have never been dissappointed by the food. But the lovely En Kefallinia managed to surprise us in many wonderful ways: the meal was not only tasty, but different, just fabulous! The atmosphere is lovely in the beautifully renovated house, and the service attentive and welcoming. We came back with our friends earlier in the evening the next time, to enjoy the dinner in the lovely garden, full of scents of herbs and fruit.",Date of visit: June 2015,En Kefallinia Organic Farm Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Do not miss Fazer's while in Finland!,"Fazer makes the best Finnish chocolate and very tasty breads and cakes. This traditional cafeteria in Helsinki centre has all these goodies, great coffees and teas, fresh salads , sandwiches etc. It is a perfect place also to mix with the locals : you will see side by side both lively students, and sophisticated elderly ladies enjoying their cup of coffee and cake.
