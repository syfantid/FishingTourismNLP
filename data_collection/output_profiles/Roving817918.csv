Best fishing experience ever!,"We went on a fishing trip, me and a friend.
On the boat we discovered a man with a huge heart and a big smile named Vasilis who just wanted us to enjoy as much as possible! We started our tour around the Old City, from there we went to the deep water to fish for small and tasty fish and then we went trolling fishing for tuna! Was a breathtaking experience. It is impossible to describe in words the moment that there is a tona on board that you have just caught this moment. for the finale we stopped at sunset close to shore for a barbecue dinner on the boat eating the fish we have just caught served with a fresh amazing Greek salad and a local bread. during the whole trip there are free drinks from all kinds. very recommended. thank you Vasilis for everything I am sure I will be back soon!",Date of experience: September 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
