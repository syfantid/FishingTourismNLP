Almost Perfect,"Stayed from 17th September to the 1st of October

Almost perfect in many aspects the only let down was the quality of the breakfast now I know some would disagree but every morning I had to check the milk as on 8 occasions it had gone off it was changed straight away the breakfast cereals were not good quality nice bread but a basic selection of items no fresh fruit apart from the occasional melon chunks ..I would definitely stay here again but I would go self catering and get my breakfast items from Nickos Bakery in Skala
Breakfast is very important meal for me and it's such a shame the quality was not as good as the bar/restaurant food

Monday BBQ is an absolute must amazing food
The bar food is awesome we ate there quite a lot pics added
Perfect location
Wonderful pool
Staff are fabulous and very hard working rooms spotless
We were bed now breakfast ..kettle and fridge and sink in room nice balcony with sea views on the 2nd floor

We are booking again for next year but as I said self catering",Date of stay: September 2017,Anassa Hotel,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fun times at Paultons Park,""" Took my nephew and niece for a stay in the New Forest and visited Paultons Park. Was extremely surprised how spotlessly clean the park is and how amazing the gardens are, attention to detail is second to none. Vast array of rides and things to keep the two entertained, aged 7 & 9. My nephew was in awe of the Lost Kingdom, especially Max the 'real dinosaur' ! It was here that we decided to have lunch. My niece had a kids meal, nephew a 'grown ups' nugget meal and my partner and I chicken burger meals, all for under Â£25. The staff are very friendly and attentive and seem happy in their work. Whilst we were waiting for our food order, Sharon in Base (I think that's what it is called) asked the children if they were having a nice day and listened to their replies and upon handing our food to us wished us a good rest of the day. Merlin rivals should take a leaf out of Paultons book when it comes to staff training! After lunch we ventured to the other side of the park and whilst Peppa Land is aimed at younger children, they were still inquisitive to have a look round.

All in all a great value day out and we shall return again during the Summer.",Date of experience: June 2017,Paultons Park,4,"Romsey, United Kingdom"
