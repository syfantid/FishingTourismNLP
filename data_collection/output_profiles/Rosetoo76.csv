An Amazing Experience,"We had a wonderful time with Anthi and her Mates. We could not have asked for a better experience. The knowledge of this crew is off the charts. We had a great day at sea catching an octopus, eel, barracuda, shrimp and my very own sardine. We ate everything we caught thanks to the culinary expertise of the crew. I would do this all over again in a heartbeat! Excellent experience.",Date of experience: October 2019,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Roast Beef Sandwich!,"I'm from Jersey and I haven't found a great roast beef sandwich in FL. I really like this place and their roast beef sandwich. I was very reluctant but tried it. The roast beef is shaved very thin and the au jus is great. I ordered ""extra"" which cost me $0.50 more which I didn't care but I didn't need it. Called my dad the next day and said ""you need to try their roast beef sandwiches!""",Date of visit: January 2019,Beef & Ale,1,"Lake Worth, Florida"
I keep trying but STUPID ME!,"Not sure why I keep thinking I'm going to get a different experience every time I go but I guess today says ""I'm done"". Watched the waitstaff do shots while I waited for my food. Margherita pizza is supposed to have ""FRESH"" mozzarella according to their 15+ page menu but instead you pay for shredded mozzarella that you'd get on top of chicken parmesan. A local who frequents this place and sat next to me said, ""Well, you NEVER order food on a Sunday. And I wouldn't have ordered that...their pizza's aren't that good."" Here's something to think about..just because their menu is extensive doesn't mean they have good food. They can't ""master"" any of it if they are all over the place!",Date of visit: January 2019,BJ's Restauraunt & Brewhouse,1,"West Palm Beach, Florida"
Pleasantly Surprised!,I saw all the excellent reviews online that I just HAD to try it. I was beyond pleasantly surprised. We ordered the crab meal and the fried snapper meal. The crab easily came out of the shell and the snapper wasn't greasy at all. The only thing I would change is the fact that I didn't know about this place sooner. The walnut pound cake is wonderful. Saved some for my coffee the next day and it was still fresh and moist...can't wait for next week to come so we can get another fantastic meal from Rodney's.,Date of visit: April 2018,Rodney's Crabs & More,1,"Riviera Beach, Florida"
Fantastic food...Lake Trout,"Pleasant surprise. Went to see the Eagle Harbor lighthouse and was hungry for lunch. Didn't know where to go...saw Eagle Harbor Inn and decided to pull in. What a great meal. We had a grilled trout sandwich and potato skins...don't order the fries, etc. Get the trout, potato skins and split it with your other half. You won't be sorry...considering you're in the middle of nowhere.",Date of stay: July 2017,Eagle Harbor Inn,1,"Eagle River, Michigan"
Mouth-watering clam chowder,"I just didn't know where to go and get clam chowder in San Francisco...there are so many places and I've been there a number of times. I passed by the Chowder Hut and thought to myself, ""Self...you are alone so you can sit at the bar, have some chowder, drink some beer and people watch."" And that's exactly what I did. The bartenders were very attentive and friendly. Great spot to kickback and enjoy the surroundings.",Date of visit: April 2018,Chowder Hut Grill,1,"San Francisco, California"
"Fish, Swim, Snorkel, Picnic or just walk around","This is a fantastic park. It's well kept, restrooms are always clean, and grounds are maintained. This park just missed the 5-star review because it has a lot of homeless people - many of who are nice and some who have a few ""not-so-friendly"" words to say. Families picnic here all the time and you will always spot something exciting in the water.",Date of experience: March 2018,Phil Foster Park,1,"Riviera Beach, Florida"
Spectacular Fresh Homemade Italian,"Whenever we travel to NYC we always try to make it a point to go to Cara Mia. The staff is attentive and friendly, the atmosphere is calming, the vino is terrific and the food is homemade Italian.",Date of visit: October 2017,Cara Mia,1,"New York City, New York"
So much fun....,"We had so much fun on this course...it's beautiful and kept up so nicely. Owner is fantastic! What a pleasant surprise! I would highly recommend doing this mini golf. We don't have children and we still had a great time challenging each other with the ""twists"".",Date of experience: July 2017,Into the Woods Mini Golf and Gardens,1,"Copper Harbor, Michigan"
Excellent!!!,"From the ""Welcome"" to the ""Check""...ALL EXCELLENT.
The food is so great we went back again in the same week for dinner.
Our first waitstaff was ""Steph""...beyond knowledgeable. She was happy, kind, and very appreciative of us being there. Our second time we had ""Kim""...again; fantastic, great, knowledgeable and pleasant. Food was just as great. I am very picky but was pleasantly pleased!",Date of visit: July 2017,Harbor Haus Restaurant,1,"Copper Harbor, Michigan"
The Burger Is Great; staff is BAD!!!!,"I CANNOT begin to tell you how BAD!! our male wait staff is...I don't remember his name but I asked for a ""PBR""...then I said it out loud ""Pabst Blue Ribbon""...then I had to point it on the bar menu"". Then he asked what we wanted...I said, ""burger, medium with cheddar""...and he said ""hamburger or cheeseburger?"". Ok, so I SLOWED down...hamburger with cheddar cheese. That would make it a Cheese burger. Ok...now for my friend to order. She said, ""I'll have the same...burger with cheddar?"". Now he says, ""Do you want a hamburger or cheeseburger?"" REALLY!!! I'm not even going to tell you what happened after that....DISASTER!!! If the burger wasn't so good we wouldn't be back. The burger is great the ""MALE"" waitstaff is HORRIBLE....if you get him; talk SLOWWWWWWWW; he doesn't get it. Currently HATE this place even though they have good food. One more thing...I said, ""I will take a large box for my leftovers""...He gives me a small box. My partner says "" she clearly asked for a large box"". He said,"" Yeah, my bad"".....GET RID OF HIM!!!! I spent a 1/2 hour or more at your restaurant than I HAD TO!!!! Gosh..you're food is good but the aggravation of your male wait staff is beyond ME...never again! As I think of my experience I went form 3 or 2 to 1!!! When he cleans the restrooms at night,..he doesn't change the toilet paper...I was searching for napkins.",Date of visit: July 2017,The Pines Restaurant,1,"Copper Harbor, Michigan"
Pizza is great...Mixed drinks --- FAIL,For pizza....FANTASTIC. Lots and Lots of people have been ordering the Tostada pizza around me but who in the HELL wants lettuce on their pizza? GROSS! Their pizza's are great. Just order something simple to start...YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!,Date of visit: July 2017,Ambassador,1,"Houghton, Michigan"
Very good.,Chili is LOADED with green peppers. I HATE peppers so I had to pick them all out but overall it was tasty. Also we had a Lucky Dog which was very good. Nice place to eat. Local beers are always a plus!,Date of visit: July 2017,Michigan House Cafe & Brewpub,1,"Calumet, Michigan"
Fresh Fish!!,Why I didn't go here soon? This place is fantastic for FRESH fish. You don't need a fancy restaurant for some really great food! We went here 3 times in just one week.,Date of visit: July 2017,Peterson's Fish Market,1,"Hancock, Michigan"
"Food, OK...Drinks, HORRIBLE.","Worst drinks. Touristy place that takes advantage of ""out of Townes"". Not coming here again. Do NOT order a mixed drink. You get it in a Coca Cola cup and very very little alcohol that they are charging you an arm and a leg for!",Date of visit: July 2017,Downtowner Lounge,1,"Houghton, Michigan"
Very Nice,Inexpensive ($5 per person) and the volunteers are VERY knowledgable. It was a nice stop along the way...go to Eagle Harbor Inn for lunch.,Date of experience: July 2017,Eagle Harbor Lighthouse and Museums,1,"Eagle Harbor, Michigan"
A Nice Surprise,This was a fantastic tour with some really knowledgeable tour guides. Highly recommended! Nice tour...unexpected.,Date of experience: July 2017,Quincy Mine,1,"Hancock, Michigan"
Pleasantly Surprised,"I had a fantastic shrimp scampi. The spinach side was very tasty. The drinks (vodka martini's) were made just right. The waiter, Robert, is the best in the biz. I would recommend this restaurant....especially to locals who get the honor of enjoying summer specials. Make a reservation!! This was definitely a great birthday treat.",Date of visit: May 2017,Ke'e Grill,1,"Juno Beach, Florida"
Nice by VERY spicy,"All appetizers, side dishes, and main courses were spicy. The food tastes great but expect that kick in your mouth...makes you drink more. I was there with a work group so we had a set menu. I ordered the red fish which had a nice light sauce on it and tasted wonderful but I did have to take a sip (or drink) of wine in between bites because of the heat.",Date of visit: May 2017,Amberjax,1,"Dallas, Texas"
Great place for Mussels!,"I was very much looking forward to mussels for dinner and I was NOT disappointed. We were there early which resulted in happy hour...$10 off mussel dishes. 1/2 pound of mussels cost me $12. So pleased. I would have liked bread instead of the fries but the fries tasted great in the broth. The happy hour drink prices are great! I definitely want to make this place a part of my monthly ""go to"" places.",Date of visit: April 2017,Mussel Beach Restaurant,1,"Delray Beach, Florida"
People falling all over people...,"I completely agree with the ""tourist trap"" reviews. You can get beers much cheaper elsewhere. In any case you have to visit at least just once to say you went to Tootsie's. On a side note I was at the bar taking a drink from my beer and a gentleman banged right into my arm making me hit my tooth when i took a sip. Ouch but thankfully no damage. Let's just say they let wayyyy too many people in at once. You literally feel like you're sardined into the place. That doesn't make for an enjoyable evening unless you're completely drunk!",Date of experience: April 2017,Tootsies Orchid Lounge,1,"Nashville, Tennessee"
Good (not great) as usual...,"Bartender is fantastic (Stephanie) but everything else is mediocre (food, drinks, prices).They make you believe you are getting a great price on the ""buy 1 get one drinks"" but you realize it's not true.",Date of visit: April 2017,Duffy's Sports Grill,1,"North Palm Beach, Florida"
Miss Tonight,"If you sit at the bar and get a bartender named ""Leni""....wait for another one to come around. She is rude, nasty and makes you feel like she's doing you a favor. Her drinks are VERY watered down and you have to pay another $9 for a shot for a normal drink. I just paid almost $15 for a vodka/ cranberry...go figure. Skip Johnny's...",Date of visit: April 2017,Johnny Longboats,1,"Riviera Beach, Florida"
This was fun,"Not as many figures as other Madame Tussauds I've been to but this was a fun museum to catch for an hour. It's clean, the staff is very friendly and the interactive touch is now very entertaining.",Date of experience: March 2017,Madame Tussauds Orlando,1,"Orlando, Florida"
Relaxing....,"My Pop and I got away from the hustle of Disney and decided on the Orlando Eye, Madame Tussauds and Sea Life Aquarium. We were not disappointed at all! For all 3 it cost us less than $90 for two tickets. Although Disney is a far far far distance when you're in the Orlando Eye it was a fun, slow and enjoyable ride.",Date of experience: March 2017,The Wheel at ICON Park,1,"Orlando, Florida"
My vote goes to: LAFAYETTE CONEY ISLAND!,"It was my personal quest to try a Lafayette dog after eating an American Coney in Vegas. I liked the Lafayette's dog better. The menu is short, sweet and to the point. Nice cold beer and the gentleman behind the counter has been there for 30+ years. Definitely a place to try when you're in Detroit!",Date of visit: February 2017,Lafayette Coney Island,1,"Detroit, Michigan"
I don't know what took me so long....,This restaurant comes with high reviews. Friends have been here and raved about the food. Usually when that happens you become disappointed. Disappointed I WAS NOT! The food was wonderful. I had the garlic shrimp which sounds strange for a Cuban restaurant but I was very pleased with my meal.,Date of visit: March 2017,Havana,1,"West Palm Beach, Florida"
Great Place for Curious Minds,"Although no manatees during my visit, I still loved this place. I could see it from my condo on Singer Island and was very curious so I took a short drive over. The building is beautiful and the grounds are kept so clean. Don't expect grandiose museum but they have a nice educational area and the people working there are very knowledgeable. The gift shop is not overpriced and has a nice selection of manatee memorabilia.",Date of experience: March 2017,Manatee Lagoon,1,"West Palm Beach, Florida"
Good - Be Cognizant of What You're Ordering.,"I'll start off with we had a fantastic waitress. My friend had the classic pastrami sandwich and the meat was beautiful - very lean. She loved her meal. I tried the pastrami reuben...if you don't know what that is...it's pastrami rolled with cheese and sauerkraut. They used the most fatty pieces of pastrami to make my sandwich that I had remove fat from each and every piece. The waitress immediately picked up on how poor the meat was and was very apologetic. Because the color of the sauerkraut is the same as the fat, they use the worst pieces because they blend in together. It's cheaper for them but cost me more. With that said, when I removed all the fat (good pile of it) the sandwich was very good.",Date of visit: February 2017,Toojay's Gourmet Deli,1,"Palm Beach Gardens, Florida"
Love These Burgers!,"This place is typically ""hit or miss"" with wait staff attentiveness like other reviewers have said but yesterday's visit was very good. If you have time to kill and don't mind waiting for your server to come along, then the food is worth it. I had the black and blue burger (medium) and it was cooked perfectly. Their pickles are great and sitting outside is really nice.",Date of visit: February 2017,Grease Burger Beer and Whiskey Bar,1,"West Palm Beach, Florida"
Nice place to see a movie.,"Friendly staff, comfortable chairs, ample leg room and nice to have a wine/beer before and with the movie. The only issue is that it's reserved seating and there's always those people who walk in late and have to turn the flashlight on their phone on to find their seats.",Date of experience: January 2017,Cobb theaters-Downtown Gardens 16,1,"Palm Beach Gardens, Florida"
Fun hangout and great food,"I went on a Friday for lunch and decided to stop back for a beer later in the day. They passed out raffle tickets and at 5pm you have a chance at winning a few prizes. As luck should have it I won a prime rib dinner. I had it boxed up and took it home. It was wonderful. The prime rib was moist with au jus on the side, mashed potatoes, and corn. It was a nice treat to a long week. The staff is super-friendly and the music is great.",Date of visit: January 2017,Crazy Horse Saloon,1,"Palm Beach Gardens, Florida"
It's OK,"The owner is going to ""attack"" this review as he does all that do not meet his standards but it's honest. Let me start out by saying I'm a local...not a tourist. You have one chance to make a good first impression. Your wait staff is great....hands down! Your food is overpriced. Hamburger meat with a slice of eggplant should not be $26...and your house sangria should be $5 a glass. If I have to sit and listen to ambulances all throughout dinner, you need to prove you're worth my time & money. You're making your customers think they are getting ""A LOT"" of food when, in fact, the salad on the plate was far larger than the plate itself. If I wanted a salad, I would have ordered one. Your meat was incredibly DRY....but I also saw the small amount of meat left on your vertical spit (wanna see a pic?) so, of course, the end of the meat would be dried out. You can say ""if you weren't happy you should have said something""...but believe me...you have One Chance To Make a First Impression. I'm not interested in someone contaminating my meal because you can't do it right the first time.",Date of visit: December 2016,Agora Mediterranean Kitchen,1,"West Palm Beach, Florida"
Do NOT expect to sleep in!,There's an older gentleman out there every morning with a leaf blower from 7:00-7:45pm. Clearly he has nothing else to do because there are NO leaves! Waking up to a leaf blower hum is probably the last thing you want to hear when you're supposed to be relaxing.,Date of stay: October 2016,Marriott's Oceana Palms,1,"Riviera Beach, Florida"
Pricey but a Good Time,"We've seen a couple of shows here. Often times the tickets come free but the drinks are way over priced. It's a two drink minimum and we never leave without it being under $100. DO NOT order a mixed drink. Get wine, champagne or beer. I repeat...DO NOT ORDER A MIXED DRINK - you will be sorry to see your bill for a watered down drink.",Date of experience: May 2016,Palm Beach Improv,1,"West Palm Beach, Florida"
Maybe only once...,"Been there, done that, spent the money, probably not again. Was it worth the price, not really. The food is terrible. It was nice to sit with a drink at your theater seat but the seat service is not necessary. Besides they aren't courteous to all the customers and very disruptive when bringing over food and drinks.",Date of experience: April 2016,Cinepolis Jupiter Beach,1,"Jupiter, Florida"
Have a Guinness on Me,"Every once in a while we'll hop in the car one afternoon and visit the Blue Anchor British Pub. There are 8' English Oak front doors and the history behind this place is very fascinating. The fish and chips are wonderful. And there's a woman who does the lunchtime cooking in the back who is fantastic. I warn you, though, pay your bill or you'll be the next victim on their wall of shame!",Date of visit: April 2016,Blue Anchor British Pub,1,"Delray Beach, Florida"
Food is WONDERFUL,We ended up here by accident. We were visiting with an aunt who loves Duffy's. Well Duffy's had a plumbing problem and we found a new fabulous Italian restaurant. You can't go wrong here. The food comes out hot and there's certainly plenty of it!,Date of visit: April 2016,Rollatini,1,"Lake Worth, Florida"
Wonderful Dinner,"We're been to the Carmine's in NYC a number of times. We thought we'd try the one in Vegas. We were not disappointed at all! Remember it's family style so you have to be careful with what you order for two people. The waiter came over and asked if we were ready to place our order. I said, ""Porterhouse, medium and nothing else. Thank you"". He was shocked but got a good chuckle out of it knowing the size of this steak. There's NO WAY you can eat anything else. We even had enough to give the table next to us some slices and they immediately ordered it! What a great night!",Date of visit: February 2016,Carmine's Italian Restaurant,1,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
Fun SOLO Night,"This was a business trip. I went in because I wanted Asian. And I wasn't disappointed at all. I didn't feel out of place, I wasn't rushed and the food was very very good. At the end of the meal, I was presented with a postcard and was told that if I filled it out, they would mail it for me. That's a fun, nice, added touch! Great place to eat.",Date of visit: February 2016,Ping Pong,1,"Chicago, Illinois"
Easter Tradition,"We go to the Lips' Easter celebration every year. It's our little tradition and we enjoy it. The entertainment is great. The foods not bad. If you get a chance to see Amanda Austin, you won't be sorry. She's fantastic and beautiful. It's fun way to spend brunch.",Date of visit: March 2016,Lips Restaurant,1,"Oakland Park, Florida"
You're There for the Theme,We had a fun time. The food was ok but you're really there for the theme. It's mob-style and takes you back in time. We went on a recommendation and liked it but will probably not seek it out again.,Date of visit: February 2016,Capo's Restaurant and Speakeasy,1,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
A Look Back In Time,This is one of the most memorable things I did in Vegas. To see the signs that once lit up the streets (strip) was just amazing. The Liberace sign reminded me of the first visit to his museum with my parents. The Debbie Reynolds sign took be back to sitting in her theater. The Riviera sign...the first hotel I stay in on my first Trip to Vegas. A nice walk down memory lane.,Date of experience: February 2016,The Neon Museum,1,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
A must see...,This is a great restaurant and a must visit while in Budapest. The food is terrific and the staff is wonderful and kind.,Date of visit: October 2016,Pest-Buda Bistro,1,"Budapest, Hungary"
Looking for a fun night out?,"Roosters is one of the best gay bars in town. The bartenders are super-friendly, each night there's a different event (from karaoke to pool tournament to drag shows), and they are welcoming of all.",Date of visit: December 2016,H.G. Roosters,1,"West Palm Beach, Florida"
Beautiful Gardens,We had a wonderful stroll through the gardens. The best part was standing under the bamboo trees and closing my eyes....it sounded like rain and so peaceful.,Date of experience: April 2016,Morikami Museum & Japanese Gardens,1,"Delray Beach, Florida"
Mario Cantone at Parker Playhouse,I love theaters. This was a nice intimate theater and I really don't think there's a bad seat in the house.,Date of experience: December 2016,Parker Playhouse,1,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida"
This a MUST Try,"We had a wonderful dining experience at Table 26. The service was terrific, the food was excellent and we even made room for a great dessert. I would definitely add this to your list of ""must try"" restaurants.",Date of visit: November 2016,Table 26,1,"West Palm Beach, Florida"
Rhythm Cafe should be #1,"Compared to the current #1 ranking restaurant, Rhythm Cafe is hand-down far better. The wait staff is very friendly, the food is hot and fantastic, and the portions and prices are reasonable. It's a good thing we don't live closer or we'd be visiting more often then we should!",Date of visit: October 2016,Rhythm Cafe,1,"West Palm Beach, Florida"
Beautiful Hotel,We were pleasantly surprised by this Hilton hotel. The view was spectacular and the meeting room was very large. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The food in the restaurant was very good. The only complaint was that the drinking glasses in the room were wiped out and not exchanged or washed.,Date of stay: October 2016,Hilton Budapest,1,"Budapest, Hungary"
Stop By For One,"Brickside Brewery...where there were more children than adults. I like to think of it as ""Brewhouse Daycare"" but in the words of Lisa ""A place where the parents drink and drive the kids home. What could possibly go wrong?""",Date of experience: August 2016,Brickside Brewery,1,"Copper Harbor, Michigan"
The BEST Pizza,Be prepared to wait...at least 45 minutes for your pizza to cook. But once it arrives you will NOT be disappointed. I'd love to try other meals but I can't get my mind off the pizza. We live in FL and have it shipped to our home. It's super easy to make at home and still VERY VERY good.,Date of visit: August 2016,Giordano's,1,"Chicago, Illinois"
Nice Venue for a Concert,"Saw the Dixie Chicks here. It was a great concert. The sound was excellent. The biggest issue i have is with the prices of food and drinks. And...each time you go in and out, you have to show your ticket.",Date of experience: August 2016,Perfect Vodka Amphitheatre,1,"West Palm Beach, Florida"
Great Hangout,"Hands down my favorite Monday Night hangout. The staff are super-friendly. Some patrons are a little off their rocker but that's what people-watching is all about. During football season they have a nice bucket special. Great, fun place.",Date of visit: December 2016,Blue Boar Tavern,1,"West Palm Beach, Florida"
Great place to stay on Marco Island,"We had a wonderful stay at The Boat House Motel. We were able to walk to quaint shops and fabulous food. We would absolutely recommend this place to stay for your next getaway. The view on the water is beautiful, the staff were super friendly and the room was clean.",Date of stay: November 2015,The Boat House Motel,1,"Marco Island, Florida"
Terrible,"I should have listened to the prior reviews. Mimosa had more orange juice then what I would buy at a grocery store. I asked for a splash more and was told it would cost me $14. Then the two African American workers were talking about ""skinny white ones"" and then barking. Needless to say, not a lovely experience. Besides you have to order thru iPad and they just expect you to know that. Never again!",Date of visit: August 2014,Wibar,1,"East Elmhurst, New York"
Great atmosphere & food,The fish entree specials are embedded right into the menu with the fisherman and location caught identified. Nice added and impressive touch!,Date of visit: March 2012,MoonFish,1,"Orlando, Florida"
