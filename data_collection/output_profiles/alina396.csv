Alina,"Experiencing the fishing tour on Giorgaros boat was a wonderful experience. It completely changed my perception to the sea and raised my awareness on the ritchness it has to offer. The best lesson on the man-nature essential relation. Great hosts, delicious fresh food and breathtaking sunset views around the magical island.",Date of experience: July 2016,Giorgaros fishing tours Santorini,5,"Santorini, Greece"
