TR7S SATISFAITE,"L'hotel est très bien situé, proche de la gare.
La chambre était propre, literie confortable, salle de bains refaite récemment je pense.
Elle donnait sur une cour et était très silencieuse.
Le petit déjeuner était correct.
Nous reviendrons lors de nos futurs séjours à Paris.",Date of stay: October 2019,Hôtel Arcadie,4,"Paris, France"
Belles vues,"L'entrée coute 12 euros, gratuit pour les enfants.
Les vestiges sont intéressantes et les vues magnifiques.
Cependant, ce n'est absolument pas sécurisé, donc très dangereux pour des enfants en bas age.",Date of experience: July 2019,Acropolis of Lindos,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great service,"We rented a Jimny soft top for a week in July, it xmas a really fun car that ourselves and our kids loved.
We had to change our dates and drop off location, but that wasn't a problem for J&D who were very easygoing - much appreciated.
The price was very reasonable also.",Date of experience: July 2019,J&D Rent a Car,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great fun,"I had a wonderful afternoon with my husband and 2 children.
Fishing was great fun, food was superbe. They lent us masks and tubas when we stopped off to swim.
The two men were very kind with all of us especially with our children.
We are very pleased to have booked this activity, the price was very reasonable too.",Date of experience: July 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
