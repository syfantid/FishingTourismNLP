Lovely place,"Out of eight nights at Avithos hotel (around the corner) we came to Esperides for dinner five times (while there were plenty other options around) - enough said. An absolute must is the orange cake with ice cream. I had it five times and loved it every time!

My wife had grilled prawns a few times - excellent.",Date of visit: August 2020,Esperides,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best aubergine dip... ever!,"Loved this place! It's set in its own garden with vegetables and fruit growing all around you. I was so craving one of those tomatoes ripening a few meters away from me I consider offering our waiter I pay to pick one! :)

The aubergine dip was amazing. And great cocktails! Would go back for sure next time I'm at Lourdas beach.",Date of visit: August 2020,Klimatis Tavern,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Our best meal in Kefalonia,"What I'm disappointed about is that our hotel told us about this restaurant on our last evening in Kefalonia. Such a shame! Had they told us about it on our first evening, there's no doubt we'd only be having dinner here. Stunning view and brilliantly delicious food!

Here's my tip: every restaurant in Kefalonia (Greece?) serves calamari fritters. If you start with calamari at the Olive Lounge, you just won't be able to eat it anywhere else. No other tavern has come even close to how light and tender these calamari were. Octopus in vinegar was brilliant, as was the seafood pasta (I'd call it a lot of prawns with some pasta - never before had I had it where prawns seem to outnumber linguine).

Oh and I couldn't stand taramasalata until I tried it here. Now I love it (as long as it's from the Olive Lounge :)

We'll be back as soon as we're back to Kefalonia. Thank you for a memorable dinner!",Date of visit: August 2020,The Olive Lounge,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
This trip is a must if you like (love?) great food,"Let me just say this: before this trip, I had never NOT finished a lobster. With Michalis, we had so much of it (wonderfully cooked, just absolutely stunningly delicious!) that we just couldn't eat it any more! Antonia is a wonderful cook and a brilliant host.

We didn't catch much fish, but what we did catch was: a stingray (threw it back overboard), crabs (ditto), a shark (ditto), octopus (cooked and ate), a scary looking fish (overboard), and a few plain looking fish (also overboard as there were just too few of them to cook). Kids had a great time, we all ate loads, jumped and dived off the boat into crystal clear water of the lagoon Antonia's husband took us to while we were waiting for our lunch to be cooked. This trip is a must, really, and we'll definitely be doing it again when we're back in Kefalonia.",Date of experience: August 2020,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Excellent hotel,"It's not possible for a hotel to not have any problems. What makes a difference, though, is how a hotel goes about rectifying these problems. Avithos is brilliant at that! (I'm talking small things - AC making a humming sound, need an extra beach towel...) It's a relatively family hotel, with a great character, excellent staff and nothing-is-impossible attitude. We enjoyed our stay and will most definitely be coming back. It's a testament to how good the hotel is when you meet families for whom it's their 3rd (or 8th!) visit. A few days into our stay it felt like we were all part of one big family. The hotel is great for kids - lots of them, all playing together while parents having a big ol' glass of local white wine by the pool - it was a bliss!

To close off, HUGE thank you to both Christinas at reception! You were amazingly helpful and really made our stay special. Thank you!",Date of stay: August 2020,Avithos Resort Hotel,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Glad we found it!,What a great place! We by pure chance stumbled upon this cafe when looking for ice cream in Hornchurch. They have ice cream and more - great selection of patisserie baked (as told by the owner) on site. Loved and will definitely be back.,Date of visit: October 2019,Le Moulin Patisserie and Boulangerie,1,"Hornchurch, United Kingdom"
Great recommendation,"I'm glad our captain recommended this place after the boat tour (Renato, in case the owner wants to know who's good at referring customers). The grilled calamari was amazing as was the fried calamari. As were the veal chops! Our waitress was great - we just loved the experience and would come back if we are ever in the area.",Date of visit: August 2019,Konoba Suzi,1,"Banjole, Croatia"
Delicious but let down by service,"The food is probably good, but by the time our mains arrived (at least 30mins after we finished starters), it was already past 10pm and our 3-year old was starting to come apart, so we had to wolf down seafood platter and didn't really get to enjoy it. Our waiter explained this delay by the fact that he ordered our mains only after we finished starters. Why? No idea. Disappointing.",Date of visit: August 2019,Restaurant Korta,1,"Fazana, Croatia"
Truffle pizza,"Best truffle pizza ever! Great service too. If you are in the Old Town, definitely stop by for pizza. Might have to wait for a table though as they only have c.6-7 tables outside.",Date of visit: August 2019,Pizzeria - konoba Harlekin,1,"Rovinj, Croatia"
Worth the trip,"It took us an hour to drive to Dolina from Rovinj but it was worth it. Great little restaurant with excellent truffle pasta. The waiter - a young chap with braces - was excellent! Portions are huge! Apple strudel was amazing. Three mains, three deserts, coffees, water and half a litre of wine came up to c.£70 - it's a steal!

Some other reviewers said the restaurant is difficult to find. Waze found it without any problems.

Definitely book (we booked on the morning of the same day we visited) as it was full when we got there (apart from our reserved table).",Date of visit: August 2019,Konoba Dolina,1,"Livade, Croatia"
3 stars is an average of two visits,"We ate at Dado twice. First time was dinner and it was excellent - both the food and the service (perhaps it's because it was the owner who served on us). The second time was lunch the following day (that's what good experience does for a restaurant - people return for more!) and it was a miserable experience. We came at 2pm, on Saturday. The waiter told us the restaurant was closing at 3pm. Ok... 3 is one hour away! At 2:15 we watched the waiter turn a couple away. Probably because it was 45 minutes from the restaurant's closing time. From 2:30pm the waiter started hovering waiting for us to leave. He first came over and asked us if we were finished. We weren't as we'd only started eating. Then he kept peaking from around the corner clearly impatient that we weren't quick enough. It became annoying as we were still 15 minutes from official closing time! By the way the total number of tables occupied was exactly two: our family and a couple at the table next to us. We finished at 2:55pm. As we were leaving we saw the remaining couple have a cheek to attempt ordering another drink. We didn't stay to see the outcome of that conversation! :)
The next day we came to Bale for lunch again and having parked across the road from Dado we saw that it was the same waiter and... decided to go to Konoba Bembo (next door) instead. Loved the service and the food there!",Date of visit: August 2019,Ristorantino Dado,1,"Bale, Croatia"
Nice local restaurant,"We had a lunch here on our last day in Rovinj. Nice restaurant and good service (unlike at the place next door...). I had fish soup and it was excellent, my family had risotto with seafood, grilled calamari and seafood pasta. All was delicious! Would definitely come back.",Date of visit: August 2019,Konoba Bembo,1,"Bale, Croatia"
Below average,"With a bit of work and better kitchen staff (I don’t think they’ve quite advanced to a “chef” just yet) they might become average one day. For now they are way below. Of the four dishes ordered only one was barely edible - french fries. The rest was as poor as they come. Stay away from fish soup, mussels and seafood spaghetti.",Date of visit: August 2019,Papiga,1,"Rovinj, Croatia"
Маруся разочаровала,"Маруся всегда оставалась для нас (во время наших редких приездов в Волгоград) надежным выбором: правильным балансом качества еды, сервиса и цены. Котлеты по-киевски и пельмени всегда без исключения заказывались и были съедены до конца.
В этот приезд Маруся разочаровала настолько, что навряд ли мы туда вернемся.
Мы были группа из 6ти взрослых и 4х детей. Сервис был не только медленным но и абсолютно несостыкованным: ожидание между выносом главных блюд доходил до 30ти минут: то есть вам принесли главное блюдо, а вашим друзьям их приносят в течение 30 минут. И вот вы сидите, смотрите с тоской на свою остывающую котлету по-киевски и надеетесь, что официант все-таки подойдет к вам проверить как у вас дела. (да, нас спросили, когда мы сели, хотим ли мы блюда одновременно или по мере приготовления. Мы сказали по мере приготовления, но эти паузы в выносе блюд были за рамками разумных).
Я заказал говяжьи щеки и то, что мне принесли - это была странная вариация на классическое блюдо. Совсем не то, что я ожидал, и совершенно не вкусно.
Жена ела блины с икрой и сала оливье - про оба блюда ее отзыв был ""ме... так себе, ничего особенного"".
Жалко. Раньше было лучше (правда, последний раз мы были в Марусе 18 месяцев до этого)",Date of visit: April 2019,Cafe Marusya,1,"Volgograd, Russia"
Идеально для семьи с детьми,"После посещения Hungry пришел к заключению, что Маруся (ресторан на этой же аллее, ближе к Волге, куда мы всегда раньше ходили, когда приезжали в Волгоград) сдала пальму первенства в плане качества кухни, сервиса и удобства для семей с детьми и Hungry теперь новый лидер. Мой бургер был приготовлен идеально medium-rare, сочный и отлично представлен (с обязательными нынче в России силликоновыми перчатками, чтобы случайно руки не испачкать). Пицца маргарита прошла тест 2х летнего ребенка - то есть он ее съел без пререканий, что само по себе знаменательно для очень привередливого в еде ребенка. Жена сказала, что мясо - самое вкусное, которая она когда либо ела в Волгограде.
В следующий приезд мы обязательно вернемся.",Date of visit: April 2019,Cafe Hungry,1,"Volgograd, Russia"
Excellent!,"Not much to say apart from I think this was probably the most authentic Chinese meal ever (ok, fine. I've never been to China, so wouldn't know an authentic meal form my elbow, but...). Twice cooked sweet and sour pork was absolutely brilliant. I will be back.",Date of visit: November 2018,Chang's Noodles,1,"London, United Kingdom"
One of the best tapas in Barcelona,"This wasn’t my first time at Taipei and it was just as brilliant as before. All tapas are excellent - burrata, squid ink pasta, pig trotters... but the best one, by a mile, is chicken legs. How they manage to fill them with suck flavour - I will never know! I’d go back to Barcelona just to have those chicken legs again... :)",Date of visit: November 2018,Tapeo Born,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Just f@cking go,"This was by a long mile one of the most memorable dinners in Barcelona... and overall.

The chef clearly loves what he does and he does it brilliantly. I can’t even tell you what we had - it was all great - but burrata and steak tartar and fish fritters were amazing! There’s no doubt I’ll be back when I return to Barcelona.

And the wine - l’Adolescent - just try it. You’ll either love it or (like most of my colleagues) hate it. For me it was - interesting...

Thank you for a great night!",Date of visit: November 2018,My Fucking Restaurant,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Easy 5,"We loved our stay and would go back - it's an easy 5 stars' review. A couple of things over and above what's been said by previous reviewers:

1. Beach is pebbles, so definitely need rubber shoes (our 2-year old wasn't impressed with pebbles and preferred to play on the grass just above the beach).
2. There are two great sandy beaches within 1-1.5 hours' drive: Phalassarna and Elafonissi. Worth hiring a car for. But getting to either after 12pm will make finding a lounger difficult/impossible, so get there early.
3. The hotel shop is brilliant - has everything we needed and at prices which were sometimes lower than the shop across the road. Pretty decent selection of wines. Ice cold beer was €1.5, which is exactly twice cheaper than getting it at the pool bar. No-brainer!
4. There is a proper supermarket 3 minutes walk from the hotel.
5. There is no kids disco! Which was a huge plus as it spared us from having Chichoowa playing in our heads long after we came back from holiday :) (those of you who are familiar with kids' disco will know what I mean).
6. However, a bit of light entertainment every evening won't go amiss. There was a pianist and a violinist playing at the bar every now and again, which was great, but it wasn't every night and it did get a bit dull in the evenings occasionally. That said, I'd rather have that than garish loud ""entertainment"" until midnight, Lanzarote style...
7. The pool is awesome!
8. What really made a huge difference to our stay and separated it from most other holidays is people who work there. Really. I was a bit sceptical reading similar comments before going on holiday, but now I see what other reviewers meant. Staff is absolutely marvellously brilliant! To name check a few with a special mention, THANK YOU:
- Stefano at the beach bar for being awesomely kind to let us use an ice bucket to chill our Prosecco (which we bought at the hotel shop for an astonishing €10! Great deal.)
- Valentina at the main restaurant for just being always incredibly nice to us and making us feel special. Our kids loved you!
- Ellie at the Cretan restaurant for making our every breakfast special. Good luck with your Master's at Birmingham. You will be running this hotel one day!
- Lefteris for making the best Greek coffee and sharing your mother's recipe for kourabiedes (little pieces of cookie heaven that go perfectly with coffee and which are to blame for the extra 3 kgs I added on this holiday)
- Anthi and Konstantina - you were great! Thank you so much for your amazing service!
9. If you are still reading, this is for the management. If you want to make your hotel 5+, consider this:
- Make Kids Club for under-4s included. It's annoying that one has to pay to send 2-year olds to kids' club. It's not like we skimped on the cost when we decided to come to Avra, so don't be tight :)
- Charging for water at lunch and dinner? Really? Come on! Provide the same water you serve at breakfast for free. Makes it feel a bit cheap, if I'm honest...
- The sun parasols on the beach (the ones that are made of hard straw) are too low. One day someone will take their eye out (I almost did a few times) and will sue the hotel. You might want to sort it out.
- Create a ""smokers' corner"" in the restaurants. When someone smokes with their meal, I don't want to be sitting at a table next to them inhaling smoke (neither do my children for that matter!). Yes, I know, technically they are outside, but as you have roofs even above your ""outside"" areas it's still as bad as if they were smoking indoors. You have lots of children as your guests - make your hotel smoke-free!

Other than that, thank you everyone at Avra for making our stay memorable!",Date of stay: August 2018,Avra Imperial Hotel,1,"Crete, Greece"
We'll be back,"It's strange how you can get so much more value for money by taking the Eurotunnel... That's how we've been describing this trip to our friends: it's kinda like Centre Parcs, only much better, cheaper, better value, nicer accommodation (by a mile!) and in Holland. And for us it was actually a shorter drive as it was only two hours from Calais.
I lost count how many different types and sizes of bungalows they have - it's really like a little village with houses that all look different. The houses are all very modern, very clean (my wife commented how when we moved beds to push them against the wall, so that our little one wouldn't roll off the bed, there was no dust underneath. That's like the highest praise from my wife! :)
It's close to the beach - c.10 minutes' leisurely bike ride. The beach (and it was hot and sunny when we stayed there) was lovely - fine white sand, a cafe, easy access...
The only downside is that the bungalows didn't have a BBQ. You could either buy disposable ones, which aren't great to cook on, or... you'd better bring one along. That's my only recommendation to Landal - put permanent BBQs near every house and it will be just perfect.
We'd love to (and will) come back.",Date of stay: May 2018,Landal Strand Resort,1,"Nieuwvliet, The Netherlands"
Below average,"Overall reaction is - meh. I ordered bouillaisse and it felt like it came from a tin. Mussels were small (how did they manage to find small mussels in April, when they are supposedly in season and you are in Antibes), dry and bland. Yep, dry.

Overall, for the amount we paid for 3 people (c.€100) the quality was below par.

Not coming back and do not recommend.",Date of visit: April 2018,Cafe des Chineurs,1,"Antibes, France"
As good as it gets,"We’ve eaten a lot of ice cream in many countries, but never as good as this. I’m actually quite indifferent to ice cream - couldn’t care either way. But this - was absolutely excellent - try coconut and passion fruit.",Date of visit: April 2018,Gelateria Del Porto,1,"Antibes, France"
Best desert ever!,"We had prix-fixe menu and the veal was excellent - a thick steak done medium rare - divine!

But the best was dessert - mille feuille we actually ordered twice because we loved it so much!

Highly recommend.",Date of visit: April 2018,Aux Ingredients,1,"Théoule sur Mer, France"
Possibly the cleanest hotel we've ever been to!,"We flew into Salzburg and took a taxi (Taxi Jaeger - google them, great service, highly recommend. We contacted them a month or so in advance and their return rate, for a van to fit a family of four with three big suitcases, was the best.). We figured we wouldn't need a car of our own this time, and it turned out the right decision - we never missed not having a car while staying at Kesselgrub. You can walk anywhere in town, a bus runs from the hotel to the slopes, and a few times we needed a taxi we could easily have one ordered by hotel's reception.

The things we loved about the hotel:
- Everything is incredibly clean. Just really couldn't find a fault with anything anywhere! I don't think we've ever stayed at a hotel which was as impeccably clean - this was a first one for us.
- Food was very good. Lots of options for kids. Everything seemed and tasted fresh. Loved the scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages were excellent - just what we needed in the morning before a full day of skiing.
- kids' play room had the best selection of toys for all ages
- we tried spa a few times and loved it. Very reasonably priced and lots of options (they even have a kids' treatment package, which our 8-year old loved)
- Good sauna. In fact two of them - one, which is kid-friendly (more on that later), outside, and one for adults, in the spa.
- Just overall very well-kept hotel with a family feel to it (in fact the owners are always around).

What can be improved:
- Pillows. Very comfortable mattresses and incredibly uncomfortable, thin pillows.
- We were a bit (a lot actually) surprised to find that adults go naked in the children's sauna. Nothing wrong with going starkers in a sauna, when it's an adult one, but not where kids are around. I asked reception, they said oh no, they shouldn't, we'll put a sign on the door. I think they did, but we didn't risk it any more.
- room temperature can't be controlled, so it's one-size fits all for all rooms with central heating. You can of course shut off (or turn down) radiators, but you can't turn it up. When we arrived, first couple of days, we could do with a bit warmer temperature in our room. Also water takes ages to warm up. They say it's because it's winter and pipes get cold, but really - takes ages. And it wasn't Siberia-kind of cold, -2/+2...

A couple of other things to mention: getting to the ski lifts takes about 15 minutes by ski bus, or 10 minutes by car. We used Ski School Happy for our 8-year old's skiing lessons and she went from zero to skiing down from the top of the mountain, in 6 days.

There's also a tobogganing slope that goes from the top to Radstadt. They say it's c.6km long. Good fun for those who don't ski.

A 12-15 minutes' walk from the hotel there's a big swimming complex, Altenmarkt Thereme. We went once and liked it. There's an indoor and outdoor pool, water slides, waves etc.

Other than that - we loved our stay and would happily come back.",Date of stay: December 2017,Familienhotel Kesselgrub,1,"Altenmarkt im Pongau, Austria"
Unless you completely ran out of options...,"This wouldn't be half as bad if it was something like £30 a night. At £75 a night I expect at least some sort of breeze in my room on an unusually hot June night. A fan, a window that opens - anything. A cleaner carpet would also be nice. But actually forget all that - just a non-smelly room would be lovely. The answer is no, no and no. The smell in the room I can't put my finger on - like a wet dog perhaps. The temperature of the room is in a way debilitating. A fan would be nice. Or allow me to open the window completely. Yes, I know, hell 'n' safety. But looking at the hotel from outside I can see a dozen of windows wide open. Yep, those residents were smart and packed a screwdriver with them (all it takes is unscrew one screw and fresh air starts rushing in!). I didn't. A spoon I found in the room was useless. I asked reception and they said perhaps it's staff rooms... I see. The stuff is immune to falling out of the windows and can enjoy a nice summer breeze coming through an open window. We (non-staff) have to suffer in temperatures close to... anyway. Unless you bring a screwdriver :)

All in all, stay here if your other option is to sleep in the street. Otherwise, probably don't.",Date of stay: June 2017,Farmhouse & Innlodge,1,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom"
Lovely place and excellent service,"We stayed nearby just outside Massa Lubrense and came for lunch one day. The food was great - big portions, fresh and delicious. I had a Negroni which was quite stronger than what one gets in London. I didn't complain! :) The waitresses were very attentive and personable - it always helps to have a baby in Italy - everyone loves babies and feels obliged to stroke our son's cheek and coo over him. They brought out a high chair, which was exactly like the one we have at home - we couldn't be happier (most high chairs in most restaurants in Campania are either huge or have no straps, so impossible to use for an 8 months' old).
The waitress (to my shame I can't remember her name) came and chatted to us and told us that her sister is currently on a university exchange in Russia, somewhere in Siberia. What a change in scenery (and lifestyle!) to go from a beautiful little fishing viallage in Sorrento Coast to a big industrial city in Siberia! Anyway, I digress - Angelo's is a lovely place - go if you are in the area.",Date of visit: April 2017,Angelo’s Bar,1,"Massa Lubrense, Italy"
Below average,"Firstly, it took them ages to take our order. But that's ok, it can be forgiven if the food is great. But it wasn't - pizza was soggy-bottomed. That's all really there is to say about the place. Oh, and they also added 10% service charge (PLUS coperti) to the bill. One of only two restaurants of about 30 we ate at over 2 weeks in Campania to have done that. There are better restaurants down that promenade.",Date of visit: April 2017,Mammina Pizzeria e Cucina Genuina,1,"Naples, Italy"
Nice little place just off the via Toledo,"Considering how tourist-heavy Toledo is I wasn't expecting to find anything nice in the area. But I was wrong - this little restaurant is superb. The grilled vegetables were excellently... grilled and smoky; pasta fagioli was delicious and filling (in fact, that lunch carried me all the way through the day. It's like a perfect winter food, except it was 21 degrees outside, but hugely enjoyable nevertheless).
All in all, I highly recommend and would go back if ever in the area.",Date of visit: April 2017,Ristorante Pizzeria Al Cucciolo Bohemien dal 1963,1,"Naples, Italy"
Possibly our most favourite place of the entire trip,"Now, we spent 2 weeks in Sorrento coast and ate at probably close to 30 restaurants over that time. This one was the only restaurant we returned to twice. Here's why.
It's worth mentioning that appearances are deceptive. We stumbled across this restaurant by chance (our 7-year old needed a loo and we were near this place). In all honesty, I normally wouldn't even look twice at a place like this: there was a chap outside the restaurant trying to get punters in (Brick Lane in Sorrento-style:)); there are big laminated pictures of ""local dishes"" on the wall outside and ""quick lunch sets of 10, 12 and 15 euro options"". The ""sets"" looked good but were suspiciously cheap for what was included. It couldn't possibly be good. Another tourist trap.
But when I looked inside I found the place very eclectically awesome! It was like a cross between church and library and curiosity shop. Really out of sync with what it looked like from outside. So we decided to go in.
The food was lovely. And surprisingly not expensive (i.e. less expensive than most other restaurants in Sorrento). My 7-year old had the ""special offer"" veal steak, which was excellent - both in taste and size. My wife had seafood salad, which she kept ordering every time we came to this restaurant. Probably because she thought it was very good... :) Peppered mussels as a starter was big and mussels very fresh and delicious. We had a number of different pastas and all of them were great too.
Service was very friendly and attentive.
One point to note: all restaurnats in Italy charge coperti. Supposedly this covers the cost of bread they put on the table. Sometimes olive oil if you're lucky. Usually bread doesn't get touched because it's just... bread, often slightly stale. This place also brings bread, but it's warm and seasoned with olive oil and oregano. In other words, they actually make an effort to justify coperti. Needless to say we'd put half a bread basket away by the time our food would arrive.
In summary, we loved it, would definitely go back when we are in Sorrento, and highly recommend it (despite the bloke on the door and laminated ""set lunch"" options. Which are actually pretty good! :) )",Date of visit: April 2017,Osteria del Buonconvento,1,"Sorrento, Italy"
Disappointing experience,"The food is good. It's not out-of-this-world good (we have had better meals in 2 weeks in Campania), but delicious and fresh, just as we expected. It's not the quality of food that put us off this place, it's their attitude that disappointed us.
First of all, the added service charge (that's in addition to coperti, which they also charge!). We've eaten at c.30 restaurants and this one was one of two to add a service charge.
Secondly, 6 euros for a bottle of still water? Seriously?
Thirdly, this little anecdote: our 7-year old ordered king prawns (which, by the way, were excellent. Freshly caught and tasting just like that - freshly caught well grilled prawns). This wasn't enough for her (we all nicked a few prawns off her plate), so I asked the waitress if they could whip up a small bowl of linguine with some butter. Just that. Simple. Children's portion of plain pasta. They happily obliged. When bill arrived I was surprised to discover they charged 10 euros for that small bowl of linguine. As Trump would say - that's SAD! :) What's annoying is that for 12 euros I could order a full-size pasta off the menu. Not the plain butter version. I just don't understand how a small portion of linguine (dry Barilla?) and a piece of butter can be assigned a 10 euro price tag.
Finally, cats. I don't mind an occasional cat. Perhaps a fat lazy owner's cat that's lying in the sun and lets children stroke itself. This place has cat infestation - at least three (possibly more) hungry cats were circling around our table begging for food. What's worse, when my wife took the baby to toilet to change, while my daughter was playing on the beach, they brought out my wife's pasta with clams. When I turned back to the table I saw one of the cats eating out of my wife's plate. Yep. I am not making this up. The waiter boy noticed this and shooed the cat away. And that's all. No apology or suggestion to change the plate. (I admit, at that time it didn't occur to me to ask them to replace it)
That's all about our visit to Maria Grazia. All in all, it just felt that the restaurant was trying hard (and quite sneakily) to get as much money out of a customer as possible. For us, it was not about the money. We've eaten at more expensive restaurants in our 2 weeks in Italy. It's about how this particular restaurant goes about applying the hidden overinflated charges that made it a very poor experience for us. (ok ok, apparently they have it written somewhere in the menu that they add 10% service charge. I didn't notice it because I just didn't expect it).
If you are in Nerano perhaps start with other restaurants - according to reviews on this site most of them are better than Maria Grazia.",Date of visit: April 2017,Maria Grazia,1,"Nerano, Italy"
What an incredible flat!,"The first reaction when we walked into the flat was - wow! Federico, the owner, decorated the apartment in the most eclectic and stylish manner - each room has a different feel to it, beds are big and comfortable; the kitchen is fully stocked with a blackboard for a wall where our six-year old wrote a message for future guests. All in all - we loved it, and would want to stay here again when we are back in Florence.",Date of stay: February 2016,Amicasa,1,"Florence, Italy"
Great food. Service - not so much.,"I am divided on what to judge this restaurant by - the quality of food (brilliant!) or service (shambolic). Giving it four stars simply because my lasagna was excellent. Just absolutely divine! The florentine steak that my wife and daughter had was well-done, which is a gastronomic crime as far as I'm concerned (are the preganant really not allowed to eat medium rare?? missus seems to be convinced this is the case). The steak was big, porterhouse size. Cost 52 euros, which is the same we'd pay in London. Home-made crisps were perfectly crunchy and delicious.
Desert was excellent - wife had pear and chocolate cake and our six-year old had ice cream. I was finishing what everyone else hadn't finished :)

Service. It is not bad because, as some previous reviewers stated, it is ""Italian"" - i.e. the waiters aren't rushing around, moving slowly, chatting to each other etc. No. The service is bad because there are only two ladies waiting tables. There are three rooms filled with tables. Probably 15 tables in total (at least!). They are rushing off their feet, but are not coping. And as much as the food is great, to the same degree we were dissatisfied with inability to get attention we'd normally expect.

Perfect for the last night before flying back home,"We had an early morning flight back to the UK and wanted to stay somewhere near the airport. I'm glad we chose to stay at Borghetto Panigale! Anna was incredibly helpful and even met us on the train platform (the apartment is literally 2 minutes walk from the station).
The place is very clean and perfect size for a family of three.
In the morning, it took 10 minutes by taxi to reach airport (cost around 15 euro).
We would definitely stay again as and when we are back in Bologna. One word of advice, though: avoid the nearby La Taverna dei Picari restaurant - the meal was pretty horrible.",Date of stay: February 2016,Borghetto Panigale,1,"Borgo Panigale, Italy"
One of the best meals in Bologna,"It was pouring rain, in the middle of the lunch hour, but somehow they found a table for us. I'm glad they did! The food was superb: my wife had cottoleta bolognese and for the rest of our week-long trip no other place could beat Donatello's cotoletta bolognese! I had a soup with tortellini and it was excellent. Our 6-year old had a ragu - just as great!
All in all - lovely ambiance, clearly a long successfull history of feeding many Italian celebrities (nope, no idea!), and excellent service. We'd go back in a heartbeat.",Date of visit: February 2016,Ristorante Donatello,1,"Bologna, Italy"
Nice little place,We came by this shop/restaurant twice and loved it - great selection of ham/cheese plates from different regions of Italy. At 12 euro a pop we found it good value - enough meat and cheese for two people. Wife had salads both times and they were superb. Wine at 2.50 a glass is a bargain! Nice stop-over after a day of walking.,Date of visit: February 2016,Vecchia Malga,1,"Bologna, Italy"
Excellent!,"This was a highlight of our trip to Rhodes (we were on a holiday in Marmaris, Turkey, and took a ferry out to Rhodes for a day). There weren't many people at the restaurant, we had a walk around and decided to take a table in the room upstairs. It has a window on each wall and is nicely cooled by the breeze. It felt like we were in somebody's house.

The food was simple yet very beautifully presented. We had octopus, green salad with feta (I know we call it ""Greek"", but surely Greeks themselves call it just salad), moussaka and souvlaki. Everything was excellently delicious. And at 40 euros or so for the three of us, for a three-course lunch with wine, I think it's a steal!

We had a chat with the owner, who was also our waiter. Very nice chap. He said that he only recently opened this restaurant. We wish him best of luck and will most definitely return as and when we are back in Rhodes. If you are in the Old Town make sure you stop by - you won't regret it.",Date of visit: August 2015,Ta Kardasia,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Lovely restaurant,"We were staying at one of the all-inclusive hotels in the area and hated our restaurant with passion. One evening we decided to go off-piste and go for a decent meal in town. We stopped at Kerem because it looked very different from most restaurnats around. For once, it didn't offer full English breakfast and sushi.

Kerem is a lovely restaurant in a listed house. We came by early, around 6:30pm, and there weren't any other guests there yet. The owner (former TV producer) kindly showed us around the house. It's quite unique and very neatly organised.

The food was good. It wasn't amazing, but delicious and nicely presented. Compared to our hotel it was just so pleasant to have our dinner in peace and quiet and have it served to us as opposed to having to queue at the buffet.

For the lovely ambiance of the place and charm of the owner we give it five stars.",Date of visit: August 2015,Kerem Restaurant,1,"Icmeler, Turkey"
Wrong choice,"...And as if to add insult to injury, on our last day at Orka, we realised that one of our mobiles (the one that we weren't using) was stolen from our room. The response of Murat Sak, hotel's general manager, was utter scepticism : ""how convenient to discover your phone is ""missing"" on your last day, and you shouldn't be calling it ""theft"" as you didn't actually see anyone steal it, nor you have any evidence..."". Well, you know what, as much as it is annoying this is not the end of the world, the phone is replaceable, but the two weeks we spent at this hotel are never going to be given back to us. Just a word of advice to all of you still planning to go to Orka: keep everything that's of any value in the room's safebox. The hotel will not be able to guarantee the safety of your belongings even if they are kept in your locked room.

So, the hotel... It's not the worst that there can be. It was just a wrong choice for us.

Rooms:
There are two types: sea-view and terrible view. The sea-view doesn't necessarily mean one will be able to see the sea, it just means that it is facing the general direction of the sea. When we arrived, at 2am, we were given a room that was facing a storage site for construction materials, bins for dirty linens and a parking lot. In the morning, we got moved to a room in the main building (block 6, I believe) and our room, on the ground floor, was facing the driveway and parking lot. Literally, 5 meters from our window someone was parking their car. We were told that this is the best they can do for now but we should check in a few days and if anything becomes available they will move us. We didn't bother because it's a hassle to unpack everything and then have to pack it up again. Anyway, we thought no car park can ever ruin a holiday if the rest of the boxes are checked...

Pools:
Some reviewers have complained that there are not enough pools at the hotel. It wasn't an issue for us because the hotel is on the beach. Why would anyone care about having enough pools when one goes to a hotel that has its own beach?? However, the hotel probably decided to rectify ""the problem of few pools"" by jam-packing the main one with as many sunbeds as can be physically fitted around it. The result - if one is in the second row of beds, one has to keep walking around looking for an opening to get to the pool. Either that or jump over the first row. And one'd better like the neighbour as there's hardly any gap between sunbeds. But that's ok, this wasn't the worst bit. The worst bit is that there is a ""tapas bar"" near the pool, which serves food pretty much all the time and lots of people take food to their sunbeds. It would be fine if the empty plates were cleaned quickly, but they aren't. The result is little tables near the sunbeds are piled with dirty plates and glasses, and even when they are cleaned away no one thinks to wipe down the tables and they are sitting there sticky with food leftovers and spilled drinks... Nice!

Getting a sunbed (beach or pool) is a challenge if it's any later than 10am. Lots of towels on ""reserved"" beds. Bane of my holiday life!

Food:
Judging by most previous reviews I am about to commit sacrilege. We did not like the food. But that is really to be expected: how is it possible to feed some 1,500 people, three times a day, and provide a selection of probably 300 dishes, and expect to make it all taste delicious? It is not possible. Don't get me wrong, there's overabundance of food choices! If one wants steak - one can have steak. Is it a good steak? No, it's not. It's not the best cut, thin and overdone. If one has never tried sushi - they sometimes serve sushi - one'll be amazed to find it at dinner. But as I have tried (and love) sushi before I can say that it's nothing like sushi. It does look like it though. And anyway, why on earth would a Turkish all-inclusive hotel serve sushi?? That's their problem, we found, they seem to want to impress with stuff that just isn't that impressive unless you do it perfectly right: Mexican night with something they call ""fajitas"" (has to be in quotation marks); Chinese night with ""sushi"" (yep, that's right, Chinese); Italian ""mozzarella"", which tastes nothing like mozzarella... I can go on and on. There are a few good dishes though. Mostly the ones that are properly Turkish - anything with aubergine is great, chicken that's cut off kebab grill, grilled veggies, olives (these were actually brilliant!). But we just couldn't eat the same five things that we liked for two straight weeks.

Whenever we came to dinner at 7pm we could easily find a table. If we came to the restaurant any later than 7:30pm it was, like some reviewers said it before, a zoo in a school canteen. We had to hunt for a table where people looked like they were close to leaving, then guard it, then hunt a waiter to clean it... Yep, zoo is the best description here.

Hotel's decoration:
It looks fine from outside, from about 50 meters away. When we looked closely it was just absolutely awful. It was so awful, it was actually funny. It was like as if someone asked me to do the DIY - that's what how I would do it (which is why I usually hire professionals to do decorating). There's hardly a seam or joint that's not smeared with paint or plaster; if it's something that's screwed, it's most likely loose; if it's sealed around, it looks like a five-year old with a sealant gun has done it. I was trying to put myself in the shoes of the owner, who at one point must have come down to accept the finished work. What was going through his mind when he saw it? Who were those people who did this? I suspect they may have been a comedy act who never touched a builder's kit before.

Now (if you haven't yet given up on reading this), the good things:

Staff - they are great! The will do their best to help, when they know how; they will work really hard; but there are just not enough of them! If we asked for something they did their best to get it.

Water slides - superb fun for our five-year old! She never tired of them.

Kids' Club - the guys (Dasha, Yana, Adilet...) were great with kids! Just can't praise them enough. Thank you very much to you all!

Turkish shave at the spa - this will be the best £15 a guy will ever spend. It was excellent - my skin never felt like this before. And probably never will, unless I go back (and I won't).

Full body massage at the spa - at £40 for 60 minutes it's a steal! I never knew those muscles in the tips of my toes existed.

Housekeeping staff - despite what many people said in earlier reviews about the poor standard of room cleaning, ours was cleaned regularly and very well. Floors were mopped, bed linens changed regularly, towels replenished... Word of advice: tip your housekeeper early on. It is worth it!

The setting of the hotel - the view is beautiful. The hotel could be a real gem if it was all done differently.

I can go on, but I've run out of steam. Get in touch with me if you have any questions.

Disappointed,"As much as we loved Murano restaurant, to the same degree we were disappomted by Cafe Murano. Unusually, I left hungry. It was either because the plates are very small (really - just quite tiny) or because they forgot our orders and it took 40 minutes from starters to mains, by which time we had to wolf it down and run out to catch a play (which, by the way, was brilliant - Elephant Man with Bradley Cooper!).
I wouldn't be half disappointed if it were one of your many everyday restaurants in Covent Garden, but as Angela Hartnett herself sat the level of expectation so high with Murano in Queen Street, Cafe Murano definitely lacks both in execution of dishes and in customer service (they offered to knock off a round of drinks, but it had to be more than that to really make us feel that they felt sorry for making our experience fairly lacklustre).",Date of visit: August 2015,Cafe Murano - Covent Garden,1,"London, United Kingdom"
This is what Sunday lunch should be like,"We stopped at the pub as we were passing through and we are very glad we did. First of all, they gave us a table (4 adults and child), high for a great place like this is unusual considering we didn't have a reservation and it was middle of the lunch hour. Secondly, the food was superb - lamb, beef, pork - everything was cooked perfectly. We are definitely coming back.",Date of visit: August 2015,Queen's Head,1,"Fyfield, United Kingdom"

But I'm glad we did as it was absolutely superbly interesting. I am coming back on my own in the near future and spending a day there to make sure I've seen and read and watched everything without being rushed.

Drink - yes. Food - no.,"There are gastropubs, and there are pubs that serve drinks and good simple food, and there are also pubs that should only ever do drinks. This is one of the latter. Great place to have a pint, but as far as food is concerned... I should've known when I looked at the menu and saw 20 entries for main, 7 fish dishes, and 7 or so curries.

It's just like Center Parcs!,"It may be that my expectations were fairly low because of reading previous travellers' reviews, which said that the place is very basic. But we absolutely loved the place! It's exactly like Center Parcs, except cheaper, better, cleaner and - in France!
If driving, it's worth picking up a few things from home: stuff for BBQ - tongs, grill cleaning brush etc. A few dishwasher tablets - they only give you two. Bath towels - the ones that are provided are quite small.
What we loved:
Comfortable beds with surprisingly crispy and pristine white linen
Great shower - hot and with excellent water pressure
Location - 10 minutes' drive to Disney, 10 minutes' drive to Auchan (way better than Waitrose, much bigger than Tesco's)
Swimming pool complex - our 5 year old loved the slides (we went once on Friday and the place was empty - little one could go on the slide as often as she wanted it. We then went on a Sunday and in 40 minutes she could only slide down once - the place was packed and there were queues just like at Disney)
Some reviewers mentioned ants problem - we had none. No mosqitoes either.

One niggle - Wi-Fi. There's a LAN cable in the room, so technically there is internet, but - try sticking LAN into your iPad or mobile. So, in other words - no internet.

Highly recommend the place!",Date of stay: May 2015,Disney's Davy Crockett Ranch,1,"Bailly-Romainvilliers, France"
Brilliant food and service,"This was our first time at Murano and I honestly can't understand why some people's reviews are negative. Perhaps it is possible that someone received less than perfect service from a waiter, but then we had five people waiting on us and I doubt all five could've been terrible. Of course, it's all relative and maybe someone just has a wider frame of reference of what a michellin-starred restaurant should be like and I just don't know any better... Anyway, for us - it was perfect!

The service was excellent - the waiters were always there when we needed them and never there when we didn't require them. We had an early sitting, at 6:30, and left at 9pm. The restaurant was mostly empty when we sat down and fully buzzing when we left. Few or many people - we still received a consistently attentive level of service.

The food... I am not good at describing food, but the presentation was superb and the taste was excellent.

We'd be happy to go back.",Date of visit: May 2015,Murano,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Would you like your child to learn to smoke?,"Every child must go to Disney. Unfortunately, I never did, but I wanted my child to experience the magic of Disney. She is five and a bit and is crazy about Frozen, Tinker Bell, Belle - the usual stuff. So, three of us went. We stayed at the Davy Crockett Ranch, one of Disney hotels. This will be a separate review. Loved it (Davy Crockett), by the way.

Disney positives:
The fireworks show, which starts at 10:30pm, is bloody awesome.
The daily parade of Disney characters (around 5:30pm) is worth seeing at least once. Your child will love it.
The train journey around the park is a sneaky way to rest your feet - you can ride on and on, it goes around in circles and you don't have to get off.

That's all, folks! Now the negatives and why we are not coming back:

Smoking. I have nothing against people who smoke. I can have a cheeky one myself. Now and again. But never ever in front of a child or where a child might see me. In Disneyland you can smoke anywhere. Literally - anywhere! This is a children's theme park, last I checked, and your child can get a whiff of second-hand smoke even in a queue of Crush Coaster Nemo ride. Lots of people smoking - in front of their children, in front of my child... This is just wrong. Hated it.

Queues - we all know that one has to queue at Disney, but as it turns out the wait at most (no, scrap that - ALL) rides is at least an hour, usually just under two hours. And then the ride lasts 3-5 minutes. Disney might say ""oh, but it's because the rides are so popular!"". I say - ""it's because of rubbish organisation and planning."". As much as my child is dedicated to Disney, it's a torture to have her wait five hours to go on three rides.

Food. It's very overpriced and very inedible. You'll find that everywhere, in all different restaurants, they have the same menu, same prices and same quality. My waiter was very apologetic, he knew exactly what I meant when I said this was the worst food we ever put in our mouths in France. Of course, there's an option of packing your own lunch, but we just don't like to carry more than we absolutely have to. Imagine 30 degrees heat, you are fighting your way through a crowd, with a tired child, with a backpack stuffed of half-melted sandwiches on your back...

There are no Disney characters out in the park for kids to cuddle up to and have a photo taken with. You know how they show Disney Florida TV adverts and there's always a kid hugging a Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse? I expected those to just roam the streets of Disney Town. None of that. Not a single Mickey to be hugged or photographed. Maybe it's just not a French thing...

So, that's it, really. As great as the fireworks show and the parade were, it is way outweighed by excessively long queues, smoking all around, and overpriced and bad food everywhere. No Disney magic for us. Disappointed, we are not going back. Not to Disney France anyway.",Date of experience: May 2015,Disneyland Paris,1,"Marne-la-Vallee, France"
Lovely little house in the heart of Valpolicella,"We spent two nights at this cottage in late October. It's in a perfect quiet location in the middle of Valpolicella countryside, surrounded by vineyards and within 10-15 minute drive of a selection of excellent restaurants (Osteria N. 1; El Pendola; Petra Antica in the town iteslf was great for pizza; La Dolce Linea nearby was perfect for breakfast...). The house is neat and very clean and nicely decorated. It's clear that the owner takes great pride in this place and she's done a great job with it. That said, it was a bit tricky with a 5-year old child.The house is very tiny and there's a circular cast-iron staircase from downstairs kitchen/dining room to upstairs bedroom. The extra pull-out sofa/bed for the child is downstairs, and as our daughter wakes up a couple of times a night we didn't want to leave her downstairs and try to manoeuvre up and down the stairs in the middle of the night, so we took her in to bed with us. The bed is fine for two but is a bit tight when it's two adults and a child. One last thing to add is that we had trouble getting online. The internet router is either very weak or the signal in general is very poor. And one does need internet access to research surrounding restaurants and sights!
But that's a minor inconvenience and is made up for by surrounding scenery and a big garden in front of the house. All in all we were very pleased with our stay and would love to come back (only if we are travelling just the two of us).",Date of stay: October 2014,Romantic House in Valpolicella: Between Art & Wine,1,"Verona, Italy"
"Great location, lovely flat","The location is perfect - 1 minute walk from Ponte Petra. We found that part of old town slightly less touristy than Piazza Delle Erbe (that said, from the flat to Erbe is a 12-minute brisk walk). Mirko, the owner, kindly provided a resident parking permit for our hire car and we left it across the road from the building.
The flat itself is very clean, big enough for a family of three with a superbly-comfortable king-size bed in the bedroom and a comfortable pull-out Ikea sofa in the living room. Walk-in shower with excellent water pressure, plenty of towels, strong internet connection - all in all, we couldn't find a fault! The owners clearly takes pride in the place and so they should - it's very nicely and tastefully decorated in white colours.

Superb food and brilliant wine,"We were staying down the road at Sant'Ambrogio di Valpolicella and ventured to Osteria No. 1 for dinner a few nights ago.

The food was brilliant. I had ox cheek braised in Il Recioto and that was incredibly tender. I thought the chef had to cook it for days... My wife and daughter shared a plate of rabbit and mushrooms pasta - superbly dilicious!

It is a quirky little place. The owner greets you and is the main face (literally - there's a huge painting of him on the wall!) of the restaurant. Funny enough they didn't have any tea. Or olives! But who worries about tea and olives when they have great (and inexpensive!) wine and deserts. Highly recommend!",Date of visit: October 2014,Osteria N.1 Cafe Wine Bar,1,"Fumane, Italy"
A great little place!,"We walked in on an off-chance that they might have a table available. They didn't, but we were invited to sit at the bar in the front room. The restaurant is tiny - 3 or 4 tables in the back. They only accept cash. No alcohol license, but we were told we could buy wine at an off license across the road and bring it in, there's no corking charge on that. So, quirky little place.
The food was excellent! My wife had a small lobster, which was tender and delicious. Our five-year old had a crab cake - possibly the best one that we've all ever tried. I had a meze plate - I know it's a seafood restaurant (and seafood was as good and fresh as it can get at a seaside town!), but how do they make their pesto!

What, you need to check our medical and criminal history first? Or there's some in-depth checking of references?? Don't bother. We just went to another bar and had a brilliant time there.

But anyway, one doesn't come to Bel Canto for food. The beautiful performances by professional opera singers was incredible. When a beautiful soprano is performing not one meter away from you it gives you goosbumps and fills you with awe. If this doesn't make one want to buy tickets to go see opera nothing will!

Great value for money,"So much has been written about this hotel that I'll only add a couple of key points:

First time we went all-inc and don't think we'll do it again. Firstly, it is shocking how much food gets wasted (and we were no exception - a bit of this, a bit of that and in the end you end up eating only a quarter of what's on the plate. Can't believe how much food goes to waste every day when one doesn't pay for every dish!

Secondly, it is disturbing to see what effect all-inc has on businesses in the area. A little shopping arcade next to the hotel has most shops shut with signs ""for rent/sale"". Bars outside the hotel are advertising beer for 1.5 euro a bottle and show all Premiership games and still are dead empty. Why would you pay even 1.5 euro when it's free at the resort!

- Although we didn't think this hotel is 4-star it is great value for money. All-inc, for 12 days, for c.£2k with flights, for a family of 3 - can't beat that.

- The restaurant was like a zoo at breakfast and lunch - hugely disorganised. Dinner is a bit more civilised as everyone sits at their assigned tables. Great selection to choose from and always could find something we liked. Word of advice: once you have been assigned your table check that your waiter is the one who'll be serving you every night and leave a tip - 15-20 euros will do. It is absolutely worth it and will make huge difference to how quickly your plates are cleaned and wine glasses are refilled. Besides, it's hard not to pity those waiters: if anyone looks overworked and underappreciated it's definitely them.

- Surprisingly decent choice of branded alcohol included in all-inc - there's a known brand available for each drink type - Jim Beam, Bacardi, Tanqueray...

- The place is very clean and is constantly cleaned.

- Usually I try to get upgraded to a bigger room at every hotel we stay; however, didn't feel the need to here - we had a standard room and it was huge!

- Mini disco - beware, those songs will keep playing in your head long after you return home. Our 4-year old loved it though!

- the beach outside the hotel is pretty unswimmable. There's a very nice virgin beach (Papagayo) just over the hill, can't take a taxi there, only walk across rocky terrain, about 15 minutes one way, but totally worth it.

Overall, very pleased with our stay at Gran Castillo but unlikely will return. Nothing wrong with the hotel, just didn't like Lanzarote as much. It's like Btritain away from Britain.

One of the most memorable experiences in Barcelona,"Similarly to one of the reviewers below, we came to Montcada for dinner at Tapeo (which is a brilliant tapas place, can't recommend higher). We happened to stumble upon this place by pure accident. There's a small inconspicuos door which is very easy to miss, but when you get in the place looks magical - small candlelit cobblestone courtyard, inside what looks like a palace.

Having paid 20 euros per person at the door (which includes a drink) we were taken to the only two seats left unoccupied, in the front row, probably the nest in the house. how it happened we don't know, probably someone who reserved them didn't show up, so we just lucked out.

The show was beautiful. Tiny stage, maybe 10 square meters, three guys playing guitar/percussion/singing and 2 flamenco dancers, danciung literally a meter away from us. You literally become immersed in the show.

Would love to come back and highly recommend.",Date of experience: April 2013,Palau Dalmases,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Excellent for a weekend getaway,"Lugaris was perfect for a two-night weekend away, but any longer and we'd start missing towel-changing and room-cleaning service. However, this we knew and that's why there were no disappointments with our stay.
Most things have been mentioned in previous reviews. Here're a couple that mattered to us.
On the plus side:
Location is great - only 5-7 minute walk from Poblenou metro station (yellow line 4), which is 5 or 6 stops away from Jaume I, the Old Town. As we only had hand luggage we decided not to take taxi from the airport. We bought T10 travel cards (a carnet of 10 tickets, which can be used on the airport train as well!), got on the train, 25 minutes later we are in Passeig de Gracia, there we changed over to metro and 30 minutes later we are in the apartment. Taxi from the Old Town at night is about 10 euros.
The flat is in a brand new apartment building, just opposite the beach. I think half of the building is still vacant and for rent/sale. There's a big-ish grocery shop on the way to apartment, so we stocked up on wine and basic breakfast suppllies.
The flat is tiny, probably more fair to class it as a decent size hotel suite rather than flat. But for 2 ppl it's perfect. All new and clean - plates/glasses, dishwasher, nice big fridge - just what we'd expected.
What we didn't like:
They advertise free wi-fi. There's wi-fi in theory, but the signal is so weak and only available in one corner of the flat that it's not fair to even say they have wi-fi. Annoyed me more that it didn't work than if it wasn't available at all.
Minor thing: the shower is good, but the bathtub (where shower is) is tiny and there's no rubber mat to put in it. It gets very slippery and it won't be long before someone slips in the shower, bangs one's head and sues Lugaris for it. Quite rightly too! I mentioned it when we were checking out and hopefully they'll sort it out.
Only 2 bath towels. Quite well-used/cheap ones. For two nights' stay it was enough, but any longer and I'd feel we need more/better/cleaner towels.
Other than that - everything was fine, so even these two niggles won't put us off chosing Lugaris for short trips to Barcelona. Still give it five stars!",Date of stay: April 2013,Lugaris Beach,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Great hotel if on business expenses but overpriced otherwise,"The pros:
Great central location on Tverskaya with lots of shops and restaurants around. Excellent bedding - a choice of 6 or 7 pillows, super soft duvet and mattress cover; AC work, so easy to set precisely the temperature one needs; great shower; very helpful staff.

The cons:
If I weren't on expenses and this was my visit to Moscow as a tourist I would never stay there - too expensive. Not even the room rate (I paid c.£220/night with early booking pre-payment) but anything else you decide to buy or use at the hotel. The rate seems to be starting at around £7 for everything. A bottle of water in your room - 350 roubles (£7); internet for an hour - £7; a shot of vodka in the bar (nightcap) - £7. Most annoying is that there's no free wi-fi at the hotel and the rate for 24 hours is around £20. Breakfast at the hotel - £20 (but then, in all fairness, when we ventured out to a cafe nearby we ended up paying c.£20 for breakfast anyway).

Perfect business hotel,"Spent three days in Madrid on business and couldn't think of a better base.

First of all - clean room with a double bed. One of the best bathrooms I've seen on a business trip in a long time - it looked like it had just been refurbished. Excellent shower with great water pressure and huge shower head.

Free internet with good reliable speed.

Excellent breakfast buffet.

Free minibar in the room - albeit sans-alcohol, but a nice surprise when you are not charged for bottled water during checkout. Reasonably priced restaurant (although I didn't eat at the hotel).

Finally, what really helped me make up my mind about this hotel (or rathre the entire AC chain of Marriott) is another AC hotel where I spent the last day of my trip (can't remember which one exactly it is, it's very close to the airport) - it was near my client's office, so had lots of time to kill inbetween meetings. They have a business area with - again - free internet, where one can work even if one sin't staying at the hotel.

Really - next time I'm in Madrid, I will definitely stay at AC Marriott.",Date of stay: October 2012,AC Hotel Carlton Madrid,1,"Madrid, Spain"
Huge portions and cheap good wine!,"Steak was immense. I also asked for 1/2 an order of jamon - they brought out a big plate piled up with it. I said I asked for half the order. This was half the order, it turned out!

A glass of rioja at the bar, with tapas, is 2 euros! Really? How is it possible?!",Date of visit: October 2012,El Rincon Asturiano,1,"Madrid, Spain"
This is not a four-star hotel! Definitely.,"This was a business trip and how I ended up booking this hotel is still not clear to me. As a general rule, business trip on company expense always means a good hotel – whatever country or city.

The biggest disappointment about this stay is that there is no way this is a four-star hotel. Some parts of it are three stars and some are closer to two.

The first thing I saw as my taxi was pulling up to the building was a huge sign saying “sex shop”. Nothing wrong with sex shops but when one is sharing the same building with your hotel it is somewhat of a telling sign – that either you are in Soho, or that the area is not that great. Or both.

Here’s what I found wrong with the hotel:

- The first room that I was given didn’t have air conditioning. Is it even still possible for four-star hotels in European capitals not to have air conditioning?? I was in Vienna on (allegedly) the hottest day since records began, so spending the night in a room where temperature was approaching 30 degrees wasn’t an option.

- The carpets quite possibly are not dirty but worn out beyond recognition. That’s the first thing that springs out at you as you exist the lift on 2nd floor.

- Same goes for the room – old stained carpet, feels like a dodgy motel room near a highway somewhere in Chicago suburb.

- Towels – quite possibly relatively clean but they have been used before. A lot.

- Internet – you actually have to plug in a cable into your laptop and then chose an “internet” option on… TV. Eventually connection comes on but quickly disappears.

All in all it did feel like a backpacker hotel (well, never really stayed in one but pretty sure that’s what it probably must feel like to be in one).

The deal breaker was the absence of air conditioning. It was incredibly hot.

I went back to reception and asked to be moved to another room, the one that had AC. I was told that there wasn’t one available. Ok, I said, I’m checking out, forget it. All of a sudden a room became available and I was moving with all my stuff to the 8th floor – across the lobby to an adjoining building.

The room was this hotel’s version of a suite – a small reception room and a tiny sleeping alcove. It actually had two air conditioning units – one in the reception and one in the bedroom. (why not move one of the ACs to a room without an AC – beats me).

Here I found the following:

- Wi-Fi was actually available in this room (again – why only this room and not in other rooms – I have no idea).

- TV was not in the bedroom but in the reception room. Ok, fine. The funniest thing, though, was that all of the 10 or so channels I flicked through were showing the same film! So, same channel on all of the ten channels. At that point I was starting to find this amusing – how did they manage that!

- The AC was so loud that I eventually turned it off. Then I woke up to turn it on because it was getting toasty quite quickly. Then I turned it off again because I couldn’t fall asleep for the noise it was making. The night alternated in a similar fashion.

Not much to add to this apart from – seriously, guys, you can’t be calling this a four-star hotel.",Date of stay: August 2012,Hotel Mercure Wien Westbahnhof,1,"Vienna, Austria"
Mediocre hotel with lots of unrealised potential,"Ironically, the problem with this holiday was another holiday we went on the year before. In 2010 we spent 2 weeks at Forte Village in Sardinia and after researching Acacia Resort we kind of assumed that it’ll be very similar (also 4-star, with its own private beach, self-contained, half-board etc.). We were proved wrong as it wasn’t nearly as brilliant as what we had experienced the year before.
The problem with this hotel, as one of the couples we met there very accurately pointed out, is that it seems to be “almost there” but unfortunately just not quite reaching the expected level of standard. Best description would be probably “mediocre hotel, with lots of unrealised potential”.
A bit of background: we are a family of three – late-20s, mid-30s, and a 2-year old, so were looking for a child-friendly hotel, with a beach, within 3 hour flight distance from London. Acacia seemed to meet all those requirements. Here’s what we liked about the hotel: security – to get in to the grounds one has to ring intercom to reception, otherwise, the big gate stays shut; our room, in the main building, was modern and clean, with a big balcony/patio; the bed was ok, big enough for 3 of us (although I personally hate the two doubles pushed together as you can always feel the gap in between regardless of how tightly they’re pushed together); air conditioning worked ok, more or less; shower had a good water pressure… To be honest, here I’m running out of things we liked at Acacia.
Now about what it is that didn’t quite “make” it for us. I guess in some ways our mood for the whole stay was determined by the first impression of the hotel. I’ll try to explain. First thing that caught our attention as we entered the lobby area was bouquets of beautiful flowers, which upon closer inspection turned out to be plastic. I am not a stickler for fine china, decantered wine and linen napkins with napkin rings but I think it’s odd that a hotel would go for plastic flowers when it’s 25 degrees outside and it’s pretty much still summer. And you are in Sicily. But oh well, plastic flowers on their own are unlikely to ruin anyone’s holiday. Then we made it to reception and were greeted by a chap wearing what seemed like an un-ironed shirt, i.e. it looked as if he just took it out of the drier. Again, I am not a tight-lipped Brit who can be offended by a wrinkled shirt, honestly I wouldn’t care if he wore a t-shirt and shorts – however, the first impression I got was that he just didn’t care what he looked like. That was later confirmed by other staff: they are all perfectly polite (unlike some previous comments that said the staff was rude. No one was rude to us.) – they just don’t care. One other example of this “couldn’t care less” attitude: in September in Sicily you can buy watermelons pretty much everywhere – there are lorries selling them alongside any major road. At dinner buffet (more about food later) on some tables they had these watermelons carved into shapes as decoration. I thought, “hmm, surely they probably have some watermelons they could serve at dinner as well”. I asked a passing waiter: “excuse me, do you have any watermelon?” “No.” And what about this one here?” “It’s a decoration” and with that he walked off. Ok, I guess that means “no”. (Later on I spotted a German granny with a big chunk of watermelon on her plate – she just ripped the “decoration” apart. Good thinking, I should’ve done the same!). And these are small instances (there are many other ones I could describe here but won’t), which, as and in themselves, will never ruin a holiday, but added together they do give a bad impression.
Moving on. As I said before, proximity of beach was a key decision factor and the hotel’s website seems to suggest they have one. The reality is this: there is no beach. There is access to water, but no beach as such. “The beach” is big and small rocks, which are impossible to navigate (especially with a 2-year old in tow) to safely get into water. Seriously. I’ve been to Crete where some beaches are rocky, but there I could walk on those rocks. Here – it’s like an obstacle course in the army. What doesn’t make sense is that when you look left or right, along the coast, some 200 yards away you can see perfectly sandy beaches. Acacia’s beach looks like someone intentionally dumped dozens of lorries of rocks on it. I’m sure it’s not the case, but that’s what it looks like. So, word of advice: if beach is important to you Acacia doesn’t have one.
One other thing – “the beach” is littered with rubbish – cigarette butts, candy wrappers, just plain rubbish (see pics). The biggest surprise came when my missus spotted two used condoms among the rocks. I am not kidding! And that’s another example of this “almost there but not quite there” impression: all it takes is send one member of staff, every morning, to the beach, with an empty bucket and rubber gloves to clean all visible rubbish, like they do at other hotels we stayed at. It can be done in 30 minutes tops. Clean beach, no condoms to step into, everyone’s happy. But they just don’t care. (surprisingly, public beach at Cefalu is spotless clean. And that’s public beach, not one belonging to a hotel.)
The hotel also has a swimming pool – a huge one, clean, and nicely maintained. However, we found the pool too cold. As in: you can get in and swim, but not really enjoy it. It felt at least three degrees cooler than the sea. I am not saying I am expecting a heated pool in the summer but still couldn’t understand how they managed to get water colder than air or sea temperature. However, that’s our subjective opinion and maybe others didn’t think so.
As you can probably imagine our mood soured by then and we were starting to find faults with everything. And that was only 2 hours after we arrived!
What we found strange is that you were expected to pay for beach towels: 3 euro per towel, every time you take one (although, in all fairness, they didn’t charge us when we were checking out. I did kind of make my opinion on it heard though), so 9 euro for a family of three whenever you want to go for a dip. It’s annoying, really, and we never came across it at other hotels we stayed in (they take a deposit in Dubai, for example, but that only to make sure you bring the towel back).
Now on to food. We had half-board and again our expectations were pre-determined by our experience at Forte Village the year before, where every meal was absolutely amazing, same half board though. Breakfast was… just poor, really: scrambled eggs artificial and gooey, a few plates of ham and cheese, warm yet stale croissants (it’s possible if you put croissants on a warm plate and keep them there for a while), mostly tinned fruit (pineapple rings, peaches in syrup)... Overall, not much choice of breakfast options and really uninspiring (is it again the lack of care?). And coffee – what I love about Italy is that you can get a great cup of espresso pretty much anywhere – except for breakfast at Acacia. A few travellers reported on a Nestle coffee machine and rubbish coffee it produces – I testify to that. And that’s a big let-down not to have a good cup of coffee at breakfast.
Dinner was hit and miss: a few times they did roasted fish and that was brilliant. A few times they did roast beef and that was just dry and bland. Overall, however, dinner wasn’t bad – we could always find something we liked. Plus they usually had a good selection of deserts. You have to pay for water though, which was news to me that half-board means only providing food at dinner, not even water included. So, it’s like a dinner surcharge you should expect to pay. In our experience we never came across it before (obviously paying for water when ordering a la carte, but not when on a half board basis), but maybe we had just been lucky and that’s a common practice we were not familiar with.
Kids Club wasn’t much of a kids’ club. It looked like a playground at a family house where kids had long gone – a bit shabby and unkempt. What caught our attention was a big shapeless mass of rubber in the corner. A few days later that transformed into a bouncy castle, except no one really cared to even splash it over with a water hose to wash off grime and mud that accumulated there over weeks (or months? years?...) It looked filthy so we didn’t let our daughter have a go at it. (see a pic)
Finally, and that probably is explained by the time of the year (last week of September), it felt like 95% of guests were pensioners from Germany and Russia. Lovely grandmas and grandpas who our daughter loved to flirt with but hardly any other couples with kids (or just young people) we could meet. What’s great though is that we refreshed our knowledge of Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole, who seemed to be on a permanently playing soundtrack during dinners.
In summary, we didn’t have an awful stay. Nothing went terribly wrong. There were no major accidents. It was just boring, uninspiring and definitely not memorable. As one traveller in previous posts said a car is essential; otherwise, we’d have gone mad from boredom if we had to stay at Acacia Resort for seven days straight. We’ll definitely be back to Sicily, not to this hotel though.",Date of stay: September 2011,Acacia Resort,1,"Sicily, Italy"
