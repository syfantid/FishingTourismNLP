Very nice day!!,"The temperature was awesome, the captain, his wife and his employee were very nice and were always proposing something to drink and to eat. We ate so many kind of fishes and it really worth it. We were only 3 customers on the boat so it was a very private tour. I recommend this activity to everyone!!",Date of experience: September 2017,Milos Fishing Experience,5,"Milos, Greece"
