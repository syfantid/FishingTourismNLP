During our walk, we found a liflet advertising daily fishing trips with Captain Giorgi's boat. We decided to give it a go, despite not knowing anything about fishing. Everything was arranged via email. We had 2 options, either to join Captain Giorgis early in the morning at 4am or mid day at 12 pm. We decided to go with the second one. We met outside his fishing boat. He gave us a few basic instructions as we had no clue about anything. He had everything prepared(fishing gear,fish food etc) and he even offered us food and snacks that his wife had made earlier that day.  The whole tour lasted for about 3 hours so be prepared, get your sunscreens or anything else you might need with you and definitely, you will never forget it!"

We learned about different types of fishing and the different species of fishes a fisherman may attract with them. We enjoyed our selves on his boat and had a lot of fun!
