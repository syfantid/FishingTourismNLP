Delicious fresh food in cozy bistro,"Very good and fresh food! Compliments to the chef. I had a salad with basilicum pesto, chicken breast, tomatoes and advocado. One of the best salads I ever had. Also cozy atmosphere.",Date of visit: January 2020,Mondieu Pansk√°,4,"Bratislava, Slovakia"
Great hotel in the middle of the historical centre!,"We stayed for two nights, great location in the middle of the historical centre. The desk receptionist is very friendly and was even able to speak dutch to us. Room very clean and cozy. Modern design. Great bed! Perfect for a citytrip. There is a strip club right in front of the hotel but we did not stay in the weekend so we did not really notice anything of it.",Date of stay: January 2020,Hotel Michalska,4,"Bratislava, Slovakia"
Best burger and cheesecake + lavacake I EVER had!,"We ordered the beabout beef burger, and the caprese burger. Both of them were amazing, especially the beabout beef burger, served with delicious union rings and french fries. Best berger we ever had. After we thought it would not become any better, the server recommended us to take the cheescake and lava cake. Well it was like a present from heaven soo good! Very nice personnel and relaxt atmosphere, very cozy. This all for a very friendly price! The only thing which i personally liked a little less was the home made lemon mind lemonade.",Date of visit: January 2020,BeAbout,4,"Bratislava, Slovakia"
Super!,"We have spent a week with 15 persons at Rieder Stub'n for our skiing holiday. It was in one word fantastic! The personnel is very friendly and flexible. They are extremely hospitable.The food is amazing just like the breakfast. Especially the sandwiches were delicious. The rooms are nice, I never had such a good shower in my room. The apmoshpere in the gasthof is typical austrian, perfect to enjoy a austrian skiing holiday. There is a special room for ski gear and the ski bus stops just in front of the gasthof. It's only a short distance to sefaus-fiss-ladis. The value you get for your money is great. This place is highly recommendable. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!",Date of stay: December 2019,Gasthof Rieder Stub'n,4,"Ried im Oberinntal, Austria"
Exciting fishing trip with captain Dimitris!,"Highly recommendable! We had an amazing fishing trip with captain Dimitris! We catched our own fish and even spotted Dolphins! We made an evening trip, we saw a beautiful sunset. Drinks and snacks are on board. Almost every time we dropped in our hook, we catched a fish, unbelievable. Dimistris is a real fisherman, ambitious about fishing and friendly. Thank you for the exciting trip!",Date of experience: June 2017,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
