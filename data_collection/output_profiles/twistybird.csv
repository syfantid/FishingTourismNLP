As perfect as ever,"Third stay at these fantastic apartments, it really feels like a home from home now.
My happy place is on the balcony staring at the unbelievable view. Last visit we had a medicane.... This visit we had another... Maybe it's me?! Devastating for some parts of the island after a horrific year anyway. Marina is the most amazing person and works so hard to make everything just right for her guests.
Fantastic spacious apartments, beautiful well kept pool and a warm welcome every time.
We will always come back",Date of stay: September 2020,Eagle's Nest Studio,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Revisit,"Had dinner here the other night and I cannot agree with the previous review.
Greeted with smiles by a beautiful young lady and shown to a table despite not having booked.
We had the cod with skordalia and the carbonara, both were absolutely delicious. On a previous visit 2 years ago I had the cod dish and had raved about it so much he insisted on trying it, he wasn't disappointed, well apart from wanting more!
Finished off with the almond pie and again no complaints (still on the hunt for orange pie...)
Reasonably priced, lovely location and great food, what more can you ask for (and a waiter who had the most gorgeous eyes I have ever seen!)",Date of visit: September 2020,Denis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Happy holiday,"Visited for 2 weeks in August, on arrival Pauline and George invited us in for a chat and some home made wine and then shared their dinner with us ( pastitsio....delicious!)
Apartments are central and have everything you need, we had one of the smaller ones at the side but I loved sitting on the balcony watching the world go by.
Home grown grapes and Loukamades made by George followed in the week....I need to try and make those!
We had a great and relaxed 2 weeks, Roda as beautiful and familiar as always. We enjoyed being a bit more central too as the beach is literally 2 minutes away.
Left with a gift of home made honey so we were thoroughly spoilt by a lovely couple.
Would highly recommend to anyone, thank you both for a special holiday",Date of stay: August 2019,Christofis Studios & Apartments,1,"Corfu, Greece"
Second visit,"Second visit to the wonderful Eagles Nest studios. Everything was as magical as I remembered including the lovely Marina. Spacious apartments and an appreciated welcome pack with fruit, water, wine, beer, butter, bread and cereal. We had a middle top floor apartment this time and I liked the slightly more private balcony with the same stunning view. Free air-conditioning which we did not need to use very much due to the time of year.
We will most definitely be back....again!!",Date of stay: September 2018,Eagle's Nest Studio,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic day,"Antonia greets you with a huge smile, coffee and home made cake! No better start to the trip. Small groups of up to 12 on a traditional wooden Greek fishing boat. Helping to reel in the catch and seeing all different varieties of fish which are then expertly cooked up for lunch by Michalis while Antonia supplies quantities of Greek grape juice... Moored in a beautiful cove, you can swim off the boat or just relax in the sun. A great day and I would recommend it to anyone.",Date of experience: September 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic !,"Just returned from 2 weeks at Eagles Nest and gutted to be home! Apartments are spotless and kept that way by Marina who is so hard working and always smiling. Bedding and towels changed every 2/3 days. Simple but adequate kitchen facilities, we only used it for breakfast. It is a holiday after all! Air con 5 euros a night, we tried without it for first few days but had to give in as it was so humid at night.
No need to comment on the view, I will never forget it, simply stunning whatever apartment you stay in.
Lovely pool area where you are often spoilt with treats from Marina, my favourite being the lemon yoghurt!
Lourdas had more than enough restaurants to ensure you could pick and choose, my favourites were Aridas Palace, Klimatis and La Mer. A lot is said about the hill down to the beach and I personally would need to have a car for the trip back up, or use the bus, but I am not the fittest!
Preferred the beach to the right towards Lithero restaurant, found it sandier than to the left, though it changed daily depending on the sea conditions . Only just realised there is another beach past Lithero which is even sandier...albeit clothing optional! Next time...maybe!
Would recommend Eagles Nest and Lourdas to anyone who wants a relaxed and peaceful holiday in stunning surroundings.
We will be back but will book direct with Marina next time after the collapse of a certain holiday firm whilst we were there. Disgusted to learn accommodation owners do not get paid until the END of the season if you book with a low cost supplier. Marina deserves better than that for the high quality holiday experience she provides.
And please all feed alley cat....you will know him when you see him!",Date of stay: July 2016,Eagle's Nest Studio,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Good traditional food,"Visited a few times over the course of the holiday. Good home cooked food at reasonable prices. We tried lots from sandwiches to pizzas to traditional greek dishes. All were excellent washed down with beer and house white wine. Friendly staff, great view (when the tanker is not there!) Great little restaurant that's well worth the walk down the beach",Date of visit: July 2016,Aridas Palace,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Superb fish,"Came for a light lunch so shared a starter and main. Had white snapper which I have never tried and it was delicious , served simply with lemon and home made fries. Can't wait to go back (chatted with owner, proud greek man, shared some of his lunch with me so I had sardines too!)",Date of visit: July 2016,Lithero Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Enjoyable,"Visited last night, welcoming and attentive. We shared spicy feta dip and bread to start followed by sea bream and mixed souvlaki (was supposed to be kleftico but somehow got lost in translation!) Would order both again though. Unlike previous review I thoroughly enjoyed the house white and ordered more...but then maybe that's just me!",Date of visit: July 2016,Spiros,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely taverna,Enjoyed a nice meal here last night. Had baked feta to start and then pork chop and sea bass to follow. Everything was delicious and very reasonably priced. Would recommend,Date of visit: July 2016,Gefiri Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best holiday ever,"I love Roda and had not stayed there for a few years, nearby but not Roda.
I was slightly worried Blue Gardens was a little way out of the village but I can honestly say i would return here year after year. A stroll to the main street (not the dangerous road previously described), a relaxing pool with plenty of space for everyone, eggs cooked to perfection every morning by Andreas who always remembered I liked 2 teabags in my northern cuppa!
Elena and Andreas are perfect hosts, whatever you need when you need it.
We only ate either breakfast or lunch here and found the prices very reasonable and the food never disappointed.
Our last drink (or two) before bed was spent at the bar in the company of Costas (aka Dustin!) who has many stories to tell and is fascinating to talk to.
We stayed in room 5 overlooking the pool and by the end of the holiday felt like we were part of a family, everyone waves and says hello as they pass below.
Would like to mention the cleaning lady (I cannot remember her name unfortunately) our apartment was spotless every time we returned to it.
We had the most relaxing two weeks, I cried when I left (slightly pathetic but true!)
Tried to re-book within weeks of coming home but our dates were not available such is the popularity of this place....though have not given up on the prospect of a cheeky week in late Sept",Date of stay: September 2015,Blue Gardens Apartments,1,"Corfu, Greece"
Never again,"Inedible, rancid pizza which to be fair they did not charge me for...But more than made up for it with the price of the wine!!!!!
Husband was ill this morning after his stroganoff.
Enough said.
Over rated and over priced.",Date of visit: November 2015,Milan Restaurant,1,"Wooler, United Kingdom"
One of the best,"Always try and come in here since we visited 5 years ago. My son was covered head to toes in mosquito bites and nothing had worked, the family took one look at him and immediately brought him some cream the locals use. One happy son and happier parents!
This visit was tempted by the rib eye special, was not disappointed! Other half had spicy Greek sausage then swordfish....Then helped finish my steak! Lovely atmosphere. Lovely family. Excellent food and good value, what's not to like?!",Date of visit: September 2015,Roda Park Restaurant,1,"Corfu, Greece"
Lovely place,"The first night of our break and we couldn't have chosen a better place to eat, tried it when it was pangolos and it was not great.
I had bruschetta and the sea bass. It was probably the nicest fish dish I have had, my husband would agree as he polished it off after demolishing his own meal of baked feta and lamb kleftiko! Couple of beers, half a carafe of wine and the bill was a very reasonable 40 euros.
And on top of that, service with a very genuine smile â˜º",Date of visit: September 2015,The Old House,1,"Corfu, Greece"
Disappointing,"My husband wanted to book a table for Valentine's day and phoned to make a booking around 3 weeks before, the young lady who answered the phone seemed rushed but confirmed it would be no problem, table for 2 at 8pm. No name requested, no phone number, no thank you or goodbye! Needless to say when he checked days later there was indeed no reservation in his name, so he re-booked a table.
Perhaps first impressions and instinct should have suggested we go elsewhere....
We deliberated over the Valentine menu but decided to go with the full menu. I had pate followed by Mediterranean salmon, the pate was straight from the fridge, cold, hard and frankly quite tasteless, served with a salad consisting mostly of capsicum peppers and no dressing of note at all with some toasted bruschetta that could have chipped a tooth.
The salmon that followed was, in my opinion, not even salmon. it was drenched in a tomato and olive sauce and even by candle-light it was obvious the fish was not a lovely blush pink colour but was actually white? I have no idea what kind of fish it was but it was certainly not salmon! This was confirmed when a couple across from us were served a salmon dish from the Valentine menu, she had a lovely pink salmon fillet whereas my offering was flat, white and tasted like cardboard.
On collecting the plates the waiter the waiter asked if everything had been alright, as my plate was practically untouched. I said that I didnt think I had been given the correct dish as it was not what I had expected, perhaps I should have been a bit plainer and said ITS NOT SALMON!!!! He shrugged and left. We decided to cut our losses and got the bill to find we had been charged for someone else's rum and cokes. My husband queried this and took the opportunity to also complain about the meal only to be told we should have at the time, which we did!! They reluctantly removed the additional drinks but still charged full price for my meal.
We dont get the opportunity to eat out very much and to say this was a disappointment is an understatement, will be taking our business and cash elsewhere in future",Date of visit: February 2015,La Torre,1,"Bedlington, United Kingdom"
Corfu at its best,"had read about this before going to Corfu, we were returning from an impromptu motor boat excursion and it was late in the afternoon, saw the sign and decided to try.
The long road lead to a seemingly deserted beach and a few houses, we parked up and although the place looked closed we went in anyway! Not being the cheeky assertive types this was brave!
I am so glad we did, friendly welcome, relaxed atmosphere we felt at home straight away and could have spent the rest of the day there
The white bait, courgette fritters and prawns were amazing (though way too much pasta for me!) On paying we had the pleasure to say hello and thank you to the skill behind the operation, Mom!
A wonderful place to while away an afternoon, though next time am having the table overlooking the beach in the corner!",Date of visit: September 2014,The Three Brothers,1,"Corfu, Greece"
Winter bliss,"For various reasons my husband and I were unable to get away for a short break until the first weekend in November, I had come across Comrie Croft earlier in the year whilst searching for wilder camping experiences, but we ended up staying elsewhere as the teen child didnt want to be in the middle of nowhere! My criteria for camping is being near some form of running water, the ability to have a camp fire, trees and peace and quiet....We therefore booked camping pitch 5 in the woods next to the mill pond and we are so glad we did. Our 3 nights were absolute bliss and not even that cold (apart from the downpour on the Saturday, but that all adds to the fun!) Obviously the time of year meant the camp site was not busy but to us that was perfect, the car park always seemed full though so folk must have been up to things elsewhere! We were enjoying our solitude too much to investigate further!

The facilities were clean and had everything you needed, washing up facilities, recycle facilities, lockers available with a socket point if needed, all perfectly acceptable for camping and a lot better than some. Staff were always cheerful and greeted you with a smile, George stopped for a chat a couple of times during his recce through the woodland.

The crisp clear night sky through the treetops offered fantastic views of the Milky Way and my husband was in his element (though after 10 mins lying on a picnic table next to the mill pond at midnight my star gazing enthusiasm wained and my camp fire and marshmallows beckoned!!)

We loved it, cant recommed enough, though dont ask for pitch 5......its ours!",Date of stay: November 2013,Comrie Croft Eco Hostel & Camping,1,"Crieff, United Kingdom"
