Exceptional daytrip,"Yiannis and Nancy are the sweetest people on earth, and make you feel at home instantly when you arrive at their boat. The trip is amazing where you have time to learn and fish, and get the experience to eat delicious fresh fish after 1 hour. Nancy’s cooking is incredible, and will never forget “Nancy’s spagetthi”. The trip is for everyone and an awesome environment to swim in beautiful places and see the island from the sea. You’ll get a fun day with some lovely warm people, and definetely a trip you will remember for the rest of your life.
If you are on Samos, you HAVE to go on this trip.",Date of experience: August 2020,Samos Fishing Trips,5,"Samos, Greece"
