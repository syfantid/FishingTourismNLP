The gem of our vacation,"In general, we are not really fans of group activities, this was however very different. You will get to enjoy a day out on the sea where you will witness how the fish you ate at the restaurants during your vacation in Cephalonia ended up on your plate and you will get to try how the really fresh fish taste. This is all accompanied by a very homey atmosphere, all of us 12 visitors were treated more like very cherished friends than tourists.
All in all, you can expect a fun relaxing day with snorkeling, learning something new about fishing, laughter and great food! Is there really anything else to wish for?",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
