Fantastic day out,"Great trip! A bit of a hidden gem as they are a relatively new company operating. Geronimus and Babis are excellent hosts and made us all feel very welcome. It was fascinating watching them pull in their nets from the night before to see what they had caught, and the food they cooked up for us as a result was incredible! We also had a lovely swim on a quiet beach they took us to. We really enjoyed being on a smaller boat where the experience was more hands-on and personal. Donâ€™t hesitate to book.",Date of experience: August 2018,Poseidon Fishing Tourism Kefalonia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great food in HCMC,"Difficult place to find at first, but definitely worth taking the time to seek out. Lovely staff, great home cooked traditional Vietnamese food, and amazing value. Can't go wrong.",Date of visit: May 2017,Cyclo Resto,4,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"
"The friendliest Yasawa resort, and the best value","My girlfriend and I spent 3 nights in a dorm here and it was the highlight of our time spent in the Yasawa islands. We were in Fiji for 3 weeks and everywhere we went we were greeted with friendly faces and great hospitality, but the staff at Coral View take this to the next level. They all took time to learn our names and everything was done to ensure our stay was first class. It made us really feel part of the Coral View family and we didn't ever want to leave!

Additionally, we found the resort to be easily the best value around on the islands. For a start, there's no compulsory meal plan here, and a buffet continental breakfast is included in the room rates. The food was of high restaurant standards, but the competitively priced a la carte menu and daily specials meant we had a lot more flexibility to order what we wanted and when we wanted, unlike most other resorts. There's also an onsite shop to use for snacks, toiletries etc.

Coral View also offer FREE snorkelling safaris to 3 reefs nearby and another FREE trip to the nearby beautiful Blue Lagoon to feed the fish and relax on the beach (see photos). This is something that all of the other resorts in the area charge for! There's a superb inshore reef featuring giant clams right on their doorstep which is in great condition as it is a marine reserve.

We also took a handline fishing trip and a tour of the Sawa I Lau caves (see photos), both of which were superbly guided by Eli from the resort. Can't recommend doing this additional bits highly enough.

The dorm itself we stayed in was perfect - clean, spacious and air conditioned, with an en suite bathroom too.

Given it is low season, the resort was quite quiet when we stayed, but this made it all the more relaxing and made the hospitality even more personal.

One other thing, if you're travelling straight from the main island, check out Sea Fiji as an alternative to the Yasawa Flyer. It's less well known about, but offers quicker and cheaper direct transfers to the islands. However, if you're Island hopping, then the Flyer is probably still the better option.",Date of stay: February 2017,Coralview Island Resort,4,"Tavewa Island, Fiji"
