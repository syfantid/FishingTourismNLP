An absolute delight,Very well located in the Palermo district this small and traditional hotel is an absolutely perfect location to see the buzz of buenes Aires. The service was fantastic and everyone was so helpful. Rooms are clean and common areas were very comfortable. You really feel you are in buenes Aires and it’s just round the corner from don Julio steakhouse. We left something by mistake and they Are arranging to send on. We also stayed at the miravida soho and was also excellent but magnolia edges it,Date of stay: January 2020,Magnolia Hotel Boutique,1,"Buenos Aires, Argentina"
Not a Michelin Star Restuarant - very disappointing,"We ate last night the 25th January and were served frankly not very good food. The special aubergine starter was far from special, doused in soy sauce. The vegetarian curry was sour and the vegetables had been cut up into very small pieces. The pad Thai was bland and a decent Thai takeaway could have rustled up better. The food was poor by any standards. WRT service the waters were inexperienced and lacked the attentive behaviour expected from a top class restaurant. One was even on his phone at one point.
The pergula restuarant also at the hotel was far superior, in our opinion, both in quality of food and service. That was very good.
We took the time to feed this back to the head of catering who took on board our comments. They gave a small discount but it wasn’t about money back it was about ensuring they addressed the shortfalls. It’s unusual for me to write a review like this but it was that far off the mark.
I really feel for those chefs who strive valiantly for a Michelin star and this restuarant got one. It also reflects badly on Michelin.",Date of visit: January 2020,Restaurante Mee,1,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ"
The only place to see the falls properly,It’s expensive but it’s very good. Access to the falls on your own and they are right on your doorstep. It’s a classic hotel but. Worth it. Service was excellent and pool area large. If you really want to get the best from your visit stay here. We transferred from IGR and again it’s expensive but worth it because their driver helps you through customs and you don’t need to wait for the shuttle from the park gate. The hotel is the only one in the park grounds. Lots of wildlife particularly at dusk.,Date of stay: January 2020,Belmond Hotel Das Cataratas,1,"Foz do Iguacu, PR"
5 star Lucia and Ivan,We had very little time to sort a visit to The Moreno glacier but Lucia and Ivan sorted us out. Picking us up at the airport and taking us to the glacier then dropping us off at the mirador del largo hotel. The glacier is amazing. Calafate is a nice town just pity about the packs of dogs roaming round. Thank you for the visit. Amazing experience and thanks for prompt responses.,Date of experience: January 2020,Indigo Sud Traslados privados en El Calafate,1,"El Calafate, Argentina"
Very friendly and helpful staff,This is a fairly basic level of accommodation but it was clean and the people very friendly. They stored our bags whilst we did the W trek and the cafe area is very good. Couldn’t fault the welcome and service. Rooms are basic. Not a lot to do in Natales and a lot of stray dogs in the town.,Date of stay: January 2020,Hostal Amerindia Patagonia,1,"Puerto Natales, Chile"
Clean and good quality,We found this a great hotel for our stopover. The staff were well organised and very friendly like most Argentinians. I would recommend this hotel. Tickets were arranged for the bus to Natales and a good breakfast. Thanks guys.,Date of stay: January 2020,Hotel Mirador del Lago,1,"El Calafate, Argentina"
A traditional Argentinian Hotel,The Miravida was a great little hotel perfectly located in Palermo which is a very nice bohemian area of the city. It’s just round the corner from the famous don Julio steakhouse and the plaza Armenia. But what was really special was the staff so friendly and accommodating. All in all a very traditional building and you just get sucked in to the special atmoshere of this location,Date of stay: January 2020,Miravida Soho Hotel & Wine Bar,1,"Buenos Aires, Argentina"
Customer Focussed,My wife and friends spent a great weekend in Budapest and were bowled over by the service from Diana Rendek night manager And the assistant front office manager Judit Czapko. Both took the time to proactively sort out issues which made it a very special weekend. As a titanium elite member it really helps when Marriott look after your special ones when they are away. Diana also recommended a great restaurant which had Hungarian food and gypsy music.,Date of stay: November 2019,Budapest Marriott Hotel,1,"Budapest, Hungary"
Top quality food and service,The food is amazing and book to avoid disappointment. After the Taj Mahal this is the best attraction !,Date of visit: October 2019,Peshawri,1,"Agra, India"
Luxury inside drab outside. Great restaurant the Bukhara.,Like my review at the ITC in Agra the outside areas need money spent on them. Inside fantastic although this is an old hotel. The restaurant was fantastic as well Bukhara. As a Marriott titanium we didn’t get the welcome gift but did get the other benefits. Staff were very helpful. Not much to do in dehli so got the one night right. Jodhpur is worth any extra nights where we stayed at the Raas. When you go to India it’s worth spending more and getting a good hotel. You need to escape the noise and dirt when you venture outside.,Date of stay: October 2019,"ITC Maurya, a Luxury Collection Hotel, New Delhi",1,"New Delhi, India"
Fantastic indoors. Drab outdoors,This is a very good hotel and my titanium membership of Marriott was fully recognised with the exception of the welcome gift. I liked the fact they wrote down what I was due. Inside the hotel is excellent as was the room we were allocated. Outside the pool area and gardens were in need of upgrade and maintenance. It’s a shame because apart from the Taj and the fort their is little to do here other than lie round the pool. Outside the gates and in the town is pretty grim. Staff were excellent. One night in Agra is enough. With a better pool area they could easily keep people for more.,Date of stay: October 2019,"ITC Mughal, Agra- a Luxury Collection Hotel",1,"Agra, India"
A bit overpriced but different,This on the face of it is a very authentic hotel right in the centre of Jaipur. It’s colonial furnishings and buildings are truly to be admired. Our room was really good wire green marble tiled floor and old worlde antiques. Really nice pool area as well. So what’s not to like ? Well it’s a bit rough round the edges and the prices are too high. Why a 3 star rating ? While sitting in the main courtyard having a drink another resident decided to pass us by on his way to do some business. This resident had 4 short legs and a long tail. Enough said.,Date of stay: October 2019,Samode Haveli,1,"Jaipur, India"
What a View !,"This is a very good hotel with a spectacular view of the fort. Service excellent, gardens amazing and food too. Despite being in the heart of the city and all that goes with that this hotel stands as an oasis. The rooms were well laid out and immaculately clean. We only had 2 nights we should have had more jodhpur is definitely the best of the cities.",Date of stay: October 2019,RAAS Jodhpur,1,"Jodhpur, India"
Ripped off by Taxis at Split Airport be aware get an Uber,My advice for people wanting to take a taxi from split airport is don’t ! We went tot he taxi rank outside the airport entrance and were royally ripped off for our ride into the city centre. They charged 450kuna when it should have been 250kuna. They didn’t look like people to argue with so we paid up and immediately loaded UBER. This is a must for Croatia. No wonder Uber are taking over from taxis. The airport should be stopping this exploitation which was a bad start to a great holiday. Croatia is a wonderful country but be wary of the organisation running the airport taxis. !,Date of experience: August 2019,Split Airport Transfers,1,"Split, Croatia"
A new and high quality Marriott,This is a very new hotel but is well appointed and located. Clean and on the beach. As a titanium member they recognised this immediately. Well located not too far out of Dubrovnik which is very busy.,Date of stay: August 2019,Sheraton Dubrovnik Riviera Hotel,1,"Srebreno, Croatia"
Such lovely people,This is a really good small hotel with immaculate rooms and a great location. We stayed before a cruise with sail Croatia which was nearby. What made this hotel truly exceptional was the caring approach h the owner Anna and her staff had for guests. Well above what you would expect. We were overwhelmed with their kindness and thoughtfulness. I really would recommend this hotel. Wish we had spent more time in Split. Easily do a long weekend there. Thank you again for a great start to our holiday Anna.,Date of stay: August 2019,Splendida Palace,1,"Split, Croatia"
We will Always miss the Almissa,"We had a great cruise with some great people from down under and across the pond. Fabulous islands and ports, fantastic swim stops and excellent service all round by the crew. The last time we had been in the country was 1987 and it was called Yugoslavia and my how things have changed. The Alimissa and crew were young bright and reliable. We had a fabulous time but you must be prepared to throw yourself in and talk to people. You will not be disappointed, and you may even be surprised and learn something new. Yeah, you have probably picked up it was a brilliant experience, and journey.",Date of experience: August 2019,Sail Croatia,1,"Split, Croatia"
Solitude,We picked this resort because it was smaller and used low rise wood rather than 4 storeys of concrete. If you want a buffet all inclusive then go to one of the many many big resorts on the island. If you want a la Carter and solitude then go to keyonna. It’s the only hotel on a fabulous beach and the service was fantastic. Thoroughly recommend for couples.,Date of stay: May 2019,Keyonna Beach Resort Antigua (All Inclusive),1,Antigua
A special piece of history in the sun,This hotel is steeped in history and from the outside doesn’t look that appealing however when you get in you see that not only does it have character the quality of the food and rooms is great. We had 3 nights here then 4 at the keyonna beach resort at turners bay. If you like a big be anywhere all inclusive like sandals then go book sandals. If you want something unique and with character then come here. The swimming pool was across the water in 2 mins again another nice touch. We stayed in the garden rooms overlooking the pillars of the 18th centrury boathouse for repairing sails from the Royal Navy in nelsons time. Brilliant.,Date of stay: May 2019,Admiral's Inn & Gunpowder Suites,1,Antigua
Fantastic weekend in fantastic surroundings,"I read a lot of reviews about poor service but some people cannot see that the quality of this resort in its furnishings and settings is first class. Yes service can be improved but it’s a brand new hotel with new employees. Food selection could be better but the people are trying reallly hard. My son and I had a great golfing weekend. Course was really good and fair. It was also reasonably fair. As a titanium member they really looked after us, and I would recommend this hotel.",Date of experience: May 2019,Hacienda Del Alamo Golf Resort,1,"Fuente Alamo, Spain"
Great Greek taverna,We went out on the fishing boat during the day and ate the fish in the evening. This is a reallly good taverna with traditional fare and drinks. A short walk from our villa and to the beach. Very friendly.,Date of visit: September 2018,Isalos Spartia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
You do not need to eat in Morzine,This is a great restaurant. Food is local and of a high standard. We ate there twice in the 3 nights. Service was great and the folks worked really hard all night. We appreciated their friendliness. I would recommend without any hesitation. Well done and look forward to seeing you next year.,Date of visit: March 2019,La Petite Auberge,1,"Essert-Romand, France"
Exceeded Expectations,Really enjoyed staying here. Relaxed and peaceful with a great auberge nearby. We did not take a car and transferred using the Morzine express who dropped us off and picked us up at the chalet. Bus into and out of Morzine is infrequent but get your act together and it’s no problem. Taxis are ! There is also a takeaway pizza in the village and the owners are happy for you to take it back. They also cook on certain nights and it’s of a very high quality. Rooms are clean and new. Only complaint was towels were not changed in our 3 night stay. The views are to die for. It has a jacuzzi and sauna as well. Great value and we will be going back next year.,Date of stay: March 2019,Chalet Pura Vida,1,"Essert-Romand, France"
Given 7 Star Treatment by the St Regis Team !,"Having stayed at the st Regis in Mauritius we knew that the quality of accommodation food and service would be very high but this really did go well beyond expectations. We were treated with friendly faces everywhere and the standard of food first class. Located on the beach and near the marina mall and emirates palace the location was brilliant. Max our butler saw to our every need but not overbearing. More supportive and informative. From the beach team to those serving breakfast the service was fantastic. Abu Dhabi itself is far more easy to live in than Dubai and more homely. The grand mosque was an amazing sight and the Louvre building another with striking appearance. It was about 21deg and we still were burnt but cool in the evening. The Toscana restaurant was our favourite and drinking champagne in the crystal lounge a real treat. All in all a fabulous 5 day break in the sun in January. Thank you Max, Taras and all the rest of the staf at the ST Regis Abu Dhabi for a pampered and special holiday.",Date of stay: January 2019,The St. Regis Abu Dhabi,1,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"
Immaculate attention to detail,It was a real privilege to stay in the klimpt room at this internally modern but outside commanding chateau. Having been to Vienna to a klimpt exhibition the gold and white interior was great as was the real attention to detail throughout. The owners were ultra helpful and was a complete delight. Well done Thierry and Ann Marie. Bravo !!,Date of stay: November 2018,Chateau De Maraval,1,"Cenac-et-Saint-Julien, France"
Open and thank goodness they were,Just left this restaurant when no one else were open we were glad these kind people could accommodate us. The meal was traditional and really good. I would thoroughly recommend this restaurant. Beats the competitors who couldn’t be bothered to open out the park. Merci !,Date of visit: November 2018,Les Prés Gaillardou,1,"La Roque-Gageac, France"
Tres Bon et magnificent !,"This B&B has a great location, good rooms and a fantastic owner who painstakingly and patiently helped improve my wife’s french. Every morning. Located 50yards from the ancient city this is like an oasis providing peace and tranquility with all the restaurants in 3 mins walk. Bravo. Much better than the plaza Magdalene which costs more and you could be anywhere. Thanks again Alan and Margaret C",Date of stay: November 2018,Sarlat Cote Jardin,1,"Sarlat-la-Canéda, France"
A very special experience,Hi we have just stepped off the boat after an excellent day with great food and great company. Highly recommended. Customer service 5 star.,Date of experience: September 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great location but a bit run down. Overpriced.,This hotel has a great location with parking underneath. It's right on the beach staff were pleasant and San Sebastián is a lively place with great pintxos bars. Th e hotel needs a refurb and the rooms were clean but definitely not worth the money.,Date of stay: July 2018,Hotel Niza,1,"San Sebastian - Donostia, Spain"

Does the job,We visited during the st Fermin festival and were glad this hotel is about a 20 min walk from the old town. If you come during the festival you will know why. Clean and comfortable and functional. No problems. Park outside. The bull run is short but a lifetime experience the party at night and music is great. Just be sure you don't want a quiet time ! They do party all night. Also wear white and red handkerchief around your neck otherwise you will stand out. As for the hotel. A welcome oasis but is located in a housing area.,Date of stay: July 2018,Abba Reino de Navarra Hotel,1,"Pamplona, Spain"
Classic Hotel with first class restaurant,"This hotel is definitely not a box standard chain hotel. It's quirky, quaint and traditional. Really enjoyed the pool which gets all day sun and the restaurant was fantastic but book early. Right close to the square Monpazier is a beautiful village and a good base to explore from.",Date of stay: July 2018,Hotel-Restaurant Edward 1er,1,"Monpazier, France"
Very nice boutique hotel,This hotel looks great and on the whole is great. We didn't give it a 5 because for its price I would have expected the finer points to be spot on. we did use the bikes provided which was a plus and the building itself is spectacular.,Date of stay: July 2018,Yndohotel,1,"Bordeaux, France"
Great aspect service and location for Cinque Terre,We looked hard for the hotel on cinque terre which had beach location and easy access to cinque terre. And we found it at the hotel Pasquale. Clean great view over the bay right beside the restaurants beach and bars. Made very welcome and worth the money. Only downside was noise from railway but benefit is you get tight to the other four villages from the nearby station,Date of stay: September 2017,Hotel Pasquale,1,"Monterosso al Mare, Italy"
Friendly and good. Can't go wrong,This is a well priced great location hotel. My wife and I really enjoyed the location and the owner really cares. Great place to stay. It's very close to the beach and the restaurant at the ill de rouse hotel.,Date of stay: June 2017,Hôtel Provençal Bandol,1,"Bandol, France"
Great Location and Condition,This is a really good hotel. Well located to bars and restaurants. Good swimming pool area and friendly staff. Well done Marriott. Knysna is a very different rugged location. We drove from port Elizabeth but next time we will not bother with port Elizabeth. Knysna to Cape Town is much better scenery.,Date of stay: February 2017,Protea Hotel by Marriott Knysna Quays,1,"Knysna, South Africa"
Top Class in every respect,"It's a game reserve but really it's a fabulous South African lodge with great food, great wines and great views. There is a lot to do but just being close to the animals and the beauty of the location is enough. I would stay at least two nights next time. Excellent accommodation.",Date of stay: January 2017,Botlierskop Private Game Reserve,1,"Mossel Bay, South Africa"
Fabulous luxury,This is really worth pushing the boat out on. It is small well furnished and was better than we had even dreamed. Cannot say enough about the location and the accommodation. Service was first class all the way.,Date of stay: February 2017,Holden Manz Country House,1,"Franschhoek, South Africa"
Modern and Bright,This is a very good Marriott hotel. Location is at the end of long street and a bit away from the V&A but you do have Table Mountain to gaze at from the pool or your window. The furniture is a bit out there but the common areas are bright colourful and relaxing. Would have got an excellent but the staff did not seem to be well trained and informed. There were lots of staff and they were pleasant. Think the management need to spend more time showing them what good looks like.,Date of stay: February 2017,"15 On Orange Hotel, Autograph Collection",1,"Cape Town Central, South Africa"
Well over priced and run down,This hotel was probably good in the 70s but it virtually crumbling down. The staff were great but it needs a major refurb. Location not so good so taxis required. Old town palma is great and better staying in the centre. Very spanish which was good but just not worth the money.,Date of stay: August 2016,Hotel Amic Horizonte,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Inside but great food,I booked this for my wife and her friends a few months ago and they loved it. So I took my son and although it's inside and the menu looked overpriced and different the tastes were fantastic. Highly recommend.,Date of visit: August 2016,el Neo Tapas & Cocktails,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Brilliant brilliant brilliant !,This is an excellent accomodation. Great views great rooms great and friendly service. Only negative is shuttles to Bellagio could be more frequent. Just means you need to be organised which is not something I do on holiday. Clean and bright.,Date of stay: July 2016,Hotel Borgo Le Terrazze,1,"Bellagio, Italy"
Not really worth the money,The photos were taken a while back as it's all a bit run down and tired looking. There is no exec lounge and the bar area is pretty small. The rooms are fine but not special but the shuttle bus was useful. Staff were friendly and right beside the stadium.,Date of stay: March 2016,Riviera Marriott Hotel La Porte de Monaco,1,"Cap d'Ail, France"
Excellent but expensive but it's Monte Carlo,Very good food and location. Bit pricey and staff were variable in how you were treated. Book ahead or you won't get in.,Date of visit: March 2016,Buddha-Bar,1,"Monte-Carlo, Monaco"
Good location and solid fare,We had a good burger meal and the surroundings were colourful. Right at the port. Service variable again,Date of visit: March 2016,Stars 'N' Bars,1,"Monte-Carlo, Monaco"
Made a mistake in booking this hotel,The hotel although part of marriott group is not what you would expect. It's pretty run down and there was a major refurb going on when we arrived. We had to use the service lifts to our room and would not have booked if we had known. It was not clear at all on the website otherwise we would have went elsewhere. The manager did upgrade one of the rooms for us. Bit of a walk from the old town. There are better hotels in the town.,Date of stay: March 2016,AC Hotel by Marriott Nice,1,"Nice, France"
Perfect in every respect,"We have just returned from Les Crosets which is a great resort because it gives easy access to the Port du Soleil without the hassle of crushing onto ski buses with hordes of people. Getting there is part of the holiday. We took the train around the north shore of lake geneva from geneva airport, no stress just a great view. We changed to a small mountain railway which took us to Val D'Llaiz a bus then took us up to the resort. A lot cheaper than a mini bus transfer. On the way back we had lunch in Montreux. The Hotel L'Etable is fairly new, very clean and extremely comfortable. The Owners are very attentive and accommodating which added to the experience. You can ski in and out. Its a great hotel and the food in the restaurant was really good. Book early to avoid disappointment!",Date of stay: January 2016,Hotel l'Etable,1,"Les Crosets, Switzerland"
Central and very well presented,"This is a very good hotel. Spotless and everything felt fairly new. The location is excellent and only a short walk from the beach and centre. Car parking, usually a nightmare in Central hotel locations was easy and secure. Calvi is a great place with lots to do in the area and crystal clear waters. The l'abbaye grounds were also of a very high quality. Only downside is no swimming pool but hey can't have everything.",Date of stay: July 2015,Hostellerie de l'Abbaye,1,"Corsica, France"
Thought of every detail,"We have just had my wife's 50th birthday at the dalmahoy. The thoughtfulness, service, quality of food and the room was first class. I cannot recommend this hotel more. Great golf and beautiful location.",Date of stay: June 2015,Dalmahoy Hotel & Country Club,1,"Kirknewton, United Kingdom"
Great Scottish Food and Service,This restaurant provides great Scottish food and the service was exceptional. They really thought about us. I would book this place early as it is very popular.,Date of visit: June 2015,Playfair's Restaurant,1,"St. Andrews, United Kingdom"
Bit disappointed,The hotel is in a great location but it felt a bit tired and over priced. The public areas lacked atmosphere and we're not really that cosy. The pool area was very bland and boring. More like a downtown holiday inn than an up market fairmont. It's a shame because this fantastic Scottish town deserves more. Fantastic views and location though.,Date of stay: June 2015,Fairmont St Andrews,1,"St. Andrews, United Kingdom"
Great location and very authentic,"This is a really well located hotel. It's rooms are excellent and seville is the best city in Spain by a long way. Take the cycle trip round the city. This is the second time we have been here and we could easily live here.

The real Spain,Great authentic hotel. It's so old it's spooky. But it's refined well furnished clean and truly a classic Spanish experience. Well located for walking into old area. Put this on your road trip ! Make sure you talk to the hotel on car parking. Not an issue but worth phoning them on how that works. You are in a town which was not designed for cars.,Date of stay: October 2013,Hotel Soho Boutique Palacio San Gabriel,1,"Ronda, Spain"
"Great golf, great area and a good hotel",The golf at this hotel is fantastic. For golfers with the rest of the family at a great pool it works. You do need to drive. Some good restaurants near by. The hotel was clean but under renovation. The food was too restrictive. By expanding the choice and quality of the food at the hotel you would stay there. But the food was poor except the breakfast which was great ! This area of Spain I worked in in 1987 and its still very Spanish and you need to take siesta to stay up late. Puerto Santa Maria and Cadiz are great. It's not a costa holiday but is that what you want play some golf (cheaply) it's included in the rate then this place is great.,Date of stay: October 2013,Barcelo Montecastillo Golf,1,"Jerez De La Frontera, Spain"
If you want to have a special weekend this place hits the mark,If you want somewhere different and memorable then la Maison sur la sorgue is the place. You get a very personal service in a superbly renovated enchanting building. There are only a few rooms so you need to book early. We stayed in the room with a view with an African theme. Breakfast is the courtyard was fantastic and we spent a long time enjoying the experience. The hotel is in the centre of this beautiful village. It's not cheap but if you really want an exclusive location to spend your time then call Frederick!,Date of stay: August 2013,La Maison sur la Sorgue - Esprit de France,1,"L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, France"
Unusual and perfect for a special break,We stayed in the room with a large terrace and a jacuzzi. The room overlooked the fabulous luberon valley and the ocres. Located in the centre of the village and right beside the restaurants. This is a great spot as part of a tour of the valley.,Date of stay: August 2013,Le Clos de la Glycine,1,"Roussillon, France"
"2 star Michelin food, but service at opposite end of spectrum","This hotel has a fantastic outlook and location. Quite magical. The food was expensive but really worth it. The service in the restaurant really was appalling. Service must not count in the michelin rating. The head waitress was glum, rude and unhelpful. The dress code in the restaurant we expected to be smart but a small tubby man dressed in orange shorts and a pink, bright green polo shirt and flip flops strolled in. Not really 2 star Michelin. Our room was small and expensive but adequate. This hotel could be 5 star in every respect but has some fatal flaws which mean we would not return. I had told the hotel in advance it was our 25th anniversary and they forgot and did not do anything. Suppose it was more important that we coughed up the cash. No real attention to detail unlike the two other hotels we visited that weekend at la Maison sur sorgue and clos glycerine who really did know how to treat you and give that special experience. Most disappointing as it doesn't take much to get things right.",Date of stay: August 2013,Domaine de Capelongue,1,"Bonnieux, France"
A once in a lifetime experience for father and son - a unique offering,"Tydon provides a unique safari experience in that you are accommodated in a camp which is not too big and you get access to both sabi sands and Kruger. The camp is right beside the gates to both parks which is a great asset. There was no problem with booking, and all arrangements were professional and courteous. I took my 14 year old son on a true father and son timeout and I could not have have picked a better holiday. The accomodation is spot on, the African food served excellent and sharing stories around the fire at night a great opportunity to learn from other people from various parts of the globe. Lyam and Stephen were great guides and knew exactly what they were doing. We did a safari walk which was another experience with stephen and lyam managed to find two male lions hunting impala which we watched with jaws open. In sabi you get very close to the animals whilst Kruger has a larger concentration. Both are worth doing. We did the 5 day which was great for us but I would not do less than 4 days unless you are just there on business.
I worked in south Africa in 1997 and the change in south Africa is significant. We stayed at the Balalika in Joburg, which is an excellent colonial hotel, and the safety issue is no better or worse than any other major city. The new gautrain is easy to get into the city. The Soweto and Aparthied tour is unmissable and the golf at Joburg Country club better than any Mainland European country and just as good as the American courses. The food and wine in south Africa is of a very high quality and the pound is very strong against the pound so it's a lot cheaper than any European location. Food is the best in the world steaks and fish. The African sky at night is unbelievable.
Oh yes, I forgot to say, it was a steady 30 degrees throughout so take the sun cream. Next winter we will do capetown and the garden route but this time the ladies of the family will be coming too !

"Better to stay here than a Modern ""could be anywhere hotel""","I stayed in this excellently located hotel in 1997 and i would always stay here when in joburg. It has the best steak restuarant ever in the Bull Run and is located beside Mandela square and sandton city shops. It's an olde worlde hotel which was built in 1949, and is a bit frayed at the edges but much better than the clinical environment of a major chain hotel. Tours were easy to organise and we were picked up from the gautrain at sandton. The gardens are great.
Pools need some work but that apart a very good hotel that's different
