Interesting place!,Feels a little morbid but fascinating none the less! Took a while to find as we got lost but was glad we visited.,Date of experience: October 2018,Catacombe dei Cappuccini,4,"Sicily, Italy"
Very tasty,"Had a lovely meal for 2, great ambience with regular musical arrivals in the square! The arancini and mixed plate was lovely and the mains beautiful. I chose the linguine pistachio pesto with king prawn...so good I will attempt to recreate at home!",Date of visit: October 2018,Antica Focacceria San Francesco,4,"Sicily, Italy"
Highly recommend!,"We went as a family of 4 having seen the trip on trip advisor before travelling. We were not disappointed. The boat trip lasted around 5-5h 30 and had something for us all...tour around the harbours, fishing, swim in the sea from the boat and then the most amazing bbq of the fish we caught! 2 of us didn't eat fish and they had brought chicken instead. Drinks available all trip and our son even drove the boat! Thank you so much x",Date of experience: July 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great place to eat,"After 2 pretty bad meals in other restaurants we were happy to find this place! Fab pizzas, definitely recommend the pork and pepper pot and the veg/cheese traditional dish too. Excellent service and food to match",Date of visit: October 2017,Via Sacra,4,"Ohrid, Republic of North Macedonia"
Breathtaking place,"Can't speak more highly of the area, lots to see and do and people so friendly. A boat trip to explore further is a must.",Date of experience: October 2017,Lake Ohrid,4,"Ohrid, Republic of North Macedonia"
Great food,Visited as 2 coupes on a recommendation. In honesty I would have walked past but inside is a hidden gem with tables laid out in little alcoves and a really rustic feel. Had to book in advance so don't expect to just walk in. Chose the fillet steak which was beautiful and the spinach side which although very garlicky was really tasty. Jug of sangria nice but bit pricey.,Date of visit: November 2016,La Pampa - Argentinisches Steakhaus,4,"MÃ¶nchengladbach, Germany"
"Great atmosphere, good food, tables a little small!","Had a table for 4. Really enjoyable and relaxed evening. Only let down by the ridiculously small tables which dont work when ordering lots of tapas dishes plus jugs of sangria!
Would return though",Date of visit: February 2014,Barceloneta,4,"Leicester, United Kingdom"
