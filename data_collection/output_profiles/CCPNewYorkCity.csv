A must!,This is one of the best meals that we had in Newfoundland in 2 weeks. The recipes rely on fresh healthy local ingredients combined in creative ways with interesting seasonings. It is plated beautifully showing the expertise of the chef. The waitstaff is professional and friendly- pacing the courses perfectly. To top it all off the views of the bay and minke whales from the restaurant are amazing. The whole experience was lovely and a highlight of our trip.,Date of visit: July 2019,Blue Ocean Dining Room at Bonne Bay Inn,4,"Woody Point, Canada"
Nice decor.,"Nice decor. Simple menu - burgers, fish, fries etc. Good service. Back deck. Evening music. Some tables some high tops.",Date of visit: July 2019,Merchant Warehouse Retro Cafe and Wine Bar,4,"Woody Point, Canada"
Fresh ingredients,This is a find! Order at the counter. Fresh healthy ingredients. Interesting panini combinations. Great coffee.,Date of visit: July 2019,The Old Store Cafe,4,"Norris Point, Canada"
Mediocre food...fast service,Service is attentive and quick but food is mediocre at best. Caters to large bus groups. Relies on processed and frozen foods. Lobster was over cooked.,Date of visit: July 2019,Shallow Bay Restaurant,4,"Cow Head, Canada"
Stay for the view,"We stayed in Cow Head because we wanted to go to the theater and explore this part of Gros Morne. Bayview Bed and Breakfast is part of the Shallow Bay Motel. You check in at Shallow Bay and have breakfast there. Bayview is a cottage with 4 units and a shared full kitchen. We stayed in a back unit that had a beautiful view of the water. There was a little deck (shared with the other 2 units) with a picnic table and you can walk down to the rocks by the water. There are sliding doors one of which is screened so you can open it and enjoy the sea breeze. The view of the sunset is lovely. The room, kitchen and shared space are very clean.
The room itself was disappointing. The room felt small and dark. The bed is full sized, soft and lumpy. The bathroom does not have any space to put anything especially by the sink. There was a coffee pot in the room but a note that if you needed more coffee pods you would have to pay for them...an oddity that we didn’t find anywhere else. Though they had WiFi, it was so weak in the room and restaurant that it was almost unusable.
For breakfast, you have to go to Shallow Bay. They host many bus tours. They do a good job of keeping private guests in a separate part of the restaurant and the wait staff is very attentive but the food is definitely meant to be efficient for large groups. There is a healthy choice - oatmeal, canned fruit, toast, coffee/tea or mixed grill- powdered scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, frozen tater tots, coffee/tea —-no substitutions. It was disappointing. We had dinner here and the food was mediocre. The service was always fast and attentive. It was sort of like a chain restaurant.
The theater in this town is excellent- sophisticated and professional- so the town could definitely use a different type of restaurant- one that serves food that is fresher and more unique like they do at the Bonne Bay Inn.",Date of stay: July 2019,Bayview B&B,4,"Cow Head, Canada"
Top Notch,"We have been traveling through Newfoundland stopping in at local theater productions along the way. This was unlike the others. We saw Tempting Providence, the story of a local immigrant who became a treasured and respected nurse. It is performed in a tiny black box theater with minimal stage props in an innovative and moving presentation. Some parts made us laugh and others brought tears to our eyes. It left us wanting to know more about this real life hero. What more could you want from a theater experience? This production is so professional we could have seen it in any New York theater. If you have a chance, be sure you go to see it. It is a special night in a small town in the middle of a beautiful park.",Date of experience: July 2019,Theatre Newfoundland Labrador (TNL),4,"Cow Head, Canada"
Dinner and theater,Cute show interspersed between traditional music. You eat first and I ordered lobster so it was a little rushed. It is a nice way to spend an evening.,Date of experience: July 2019,Twillingate/NWI Dinner Theatre,4,"Twillingate, Canada"
Outside dining on a beautiful day.,This is a place to go if the weather is nice and you would like to eat outside on a little dock with great views. The food is okay but the scenery really makes it worth the trip.,Date of visit: July 2019,Doyle Sansome & Sons Lobster Pool,4,"Twillingate, Canada"
Great hiking trails,We hiked the numerous trails around the lighthouse and they led to several lovely coves. They are easy hikes. The exhibit on the Titanic that is in the lighthouse is very informative and moving.,Date of experience: July 2019,Long Point Lighthouse,4,"Twillingate, Canada"
Interesting,"There is interesting memorabilia from the family, a whale skeleton and several out buildings. You get a sense of the life of a fisher.",Date of experience: July 2019,Prime Berth Fishing Museum,4,"Twillingate, Canada"
"Convenient, clean, friendly","This is a lovely bed and breakfast. Thelma and her husband are very friendly and accommodating. They will help you with reservations, tips and ideas. We wanted to hike the top of Twillingate trail but they warned us that it was very wet and several people had slipped there so they made another safer suggestion. When we were leaving they called ahead to check on the iceberg that was in another town.
The inn itself is very clean and appears to be very new. The room was bright, large and airy. The bed was comfortable. The innkeepers have tried to think of everything you could need including hiking sticks, binoculars, umbrellas, coffee, tea and treats in the common area along with a refrigerator for everyone to use. After a hot breakfast, you get two homemade muffins to take with you for the day.Three unique things are -1) You can’t wear your shoes in the inn- they must be left on a shelf in the front hall. 2) Breakfast is at 8:00. Everyone eats together at common tables. Everyone eats the same thing. There is variety. 3) Your room gets cleaned if you request/want it.
I would definitely stay hear again.",Date of stay: July 2019,Iceberg Alley Bed & Breakfast,4,"Twillingate, Canada"
Church,The guides are very informative.The church is beautiful. A quick 1/2 hour will be very productive and interesting.,Date of experience: July 2019,Basilica Cathedral of St. John the Baptist,4,"St. John's, Canada"
Cold but fun,Dress warmly because it is really windy here. The trails are beautiful and those around the lighthouse are easy.,Date of experience: July 2019,Cape Spear Lighthouse National Historic Site,4,"St. John's, Canada"
Good in a pinch,"The food was okay. Our fried clams were burnt to a crisp. They did refund the money. Many things were not available. Waitstaff is friendly but unprofessional- chatting loudly with each other by the bar, never checking to see if everything is okay once the food is served.",Date of visit: July 2019,The Celtic Hearth,4,"St. John's, Canada"
Gluten free,"Very professional service. Food was creative, interesting and delicious. Many Gluten free and vegan options.",Date of visit: July 2019,Evoo,4,"St. John's, Canada"
Very convenient,"This hotel is conveniently located to most attractions, nightlife and restaurants. There is private parking. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The room is large extremely clean and nicely decorated. There was a fireplace , a chair for relaxing and a big screen TV. WiFi was good. The bathroom was large with a huge shower, consistently hot water, heated tile floors and a towel warmer.
It would be a 5 star review eexcept that we had a first floor room at the end of the hall (Room 122). First the windows were frosted so that you couldn’t tell what the weather was like. Second of all this room is between the rooms housing mechanical equipment and the elevator bank. All night there were unusual noises that would wake me up. Also if someone is walking around above you, the floor/ ceiling creaks very loudly. At one point my husband jumped out of bed because he thought someone was walking in our room. I would book this hotel again but I would request a room on an upper floor.",Date of stay: July 2019,Murray Premises Hotel,4,"St. John's, Canada"
Beautiful birds,Small but interesting. See the birds up close. A lot about an hour. Step down the the waterfront for beautiful views,Date of experience: April 2019,Florida Keys Wild Bird Rehabilitation Center,4,"Key Largo, Florida"
"Some things excellent, some misses...still developing","We stayed here for 4 nights. The property is absolutely beautiful. From the gates that open to the property giving you a very private feel to the lit palm trees that line the walkways it feels like paradise. You can see the beautiful sunset from each restaurant and many places along the pool. The property is meticulously maintained. There are a variety of seating possibilities along the waterfront and pool including Adirondack chairs, loungers and cabanas. Pool service was excellent. Wait staff pass by frequently and pick up empty glasses and take new orders. You can order food from the Tiki bar at the pool. They give you a little cooler with waters.
The bungalows are beautifully decorated. We stayed in 332 which was very secluded but close enough to all amenities. Our friends were in a unit that was near the Zen Pool and it was identical. The units have a fridge with a few sodas and a keurig with a few coffe pods. No tea ...no liquor...no room service. I love a cup of tea before bed but it wasn’t possible. - a miss. Each bungalow has an outside area that is lovely and very private- a seating area, railhead shower, a soaking tub. The bungalows have a very sexy feel.
The bungalows are very clean but daily housekeeping is a little haphazard. Our friends had some glasses On their coffee table that sat there for 3 days until they moved them to the coffee bar. Then they were finally removed. One day we only had decaf coffee at our coffee bar. Another day they left a dust rag in the room. None of this was a big deal but they are definitely misses for a high end property.
We found the food to be much better than most all inclusives and better than most places in the Keys and we have been in the Keys several times in the last few years. Fish Tails and Senor Sea offer 4 course dinners with 2 choices per course. Each was very good and you can always have more. The bartenders are excellent but there are no after dinner cordials...a miss. Bogie and Bacalls is a lovely dining experience - cocktails, 6 courses, beautiful views from the balcony, wine pairings, a definite must
Lunch is a buffet or you can order from the Tiki Bar. The signature burger is an another must try as the tomato jam is the perfect finishing touch.
Breakfast has all of the choices you would want- eggs benedict, veggies, pancakes, French toast, fruit, cheeses , hot and cold meats, yogurt, cereals, muesli, nuts, omelet bar but strangely no oatmeal - an interesting omission since they advertise a spa and yoga classes. Many people who are interested in healthy choices would want oatmeal - as an add-in for yogurt or hot as a base.
We found our time here very quiet and relaxing but if you are choosing this place because you want the activity of an all inclusive it is simply not there yet. They publish a daily schedule but it really only lists one yoga class (which was great) every day. The only thing that changed on that paper everyday was the date. One day there was an Italian dinner- it wasn’t on the daily schedule ...they had to come by and ask each person at the pool or text you...odd. There are some paddle boards, kayaks and a floating tiki bar. There is a living room with some board games but we were not shown on our tour so we didn’t find it until later. The spa menu is sparse- no facials and definitely high end. I approached the guy at the water sports hut to arrange fishing for my husband. There is no fishing equipment for use on the piers. He offered a back country fishing trip. Since we were just in the Keys in February I knew he wouldn’t want to go on a back country trip alone. I asked if there was another guest that might want to split a boat and said yes he thought there was. I also asked him to find out if there were per head boats that went out from Key Largo and he said there were and he would check them out and get back to me. He took my phone number and said if he found out soon he would come by the pool, if not he would text me. He did neither and my husband ended up not going fishing...a big miss. I would have set it up myself but I was confident that at a property like this concierge type services would be in place. I think they are still figuring this part out.
This is a beautiful property, great food, lovely restaurant and pool staff, quiet and, relaxing. They still need to work some things out but it would be a perfect place for a honeymoon or special anniversary.",Date of stay: April 2019,Bungalows Key Largo,4,"Key Largo, Florida"
"Convenient , clean, modern and friendly","You could not pick a better hotel in Athens. We stayed for 6 days. The hotel itself is modern and very clean. Our room at the front of the hotel on the second floor was roomy and quiet.
When we arrived they came to our room with drinks and cheeses etc. It was a lovely welcoming gesture especially after a 10 hour flight. It was the first indication that service at this hotel was going to be exceptional and it was. The staff (and we dealt with several different people) were all helpful but more importantly attentive, remembering you and what you might like, genuine and warm. There was someone at the desk 24/7 and we were even encouraged to call them if we needed a taxi and they would send one. They booked restaurants, tours, taxis, carried luggage and greeted us when entering or leaving. They don’t have irons in the room so you just call downstairs and they iron your clothes for free and return it in 15 minutes. The breakfast is amazing with hot foods, meats, cheeses, breads, cakes, yogurt, and toppings - along with coffee , a variety of teas, and fresh juice. Honestly it was the best yogurt I had in 15 days in Greece. The bar is open in the afternoon for a cold drink after a hot day in Athens.
When I was going to book this hotel I was a little concerned about the area because of several reviews. All of Athens is covered with tagging ( not from gangs from kids) and the buildings are a little dim. The block of this hotel is no different. There are a group of older gentlemen who put their wares out in the morning and a man who puts his birds out on the balcony. The street is narrow but is right off the Ermou Street which is a main shopping street. It is a few blocks from Monistriaki Square, the main square in Psirri and Thissio Station which connects to a street full of Greek Tavernas and a pedestrian walk to the Acropolis. It is very convenient . We came home at all times of the day and night and never once felt unsafe and we are pretty cautious New Yorkers. I would choose this hotel in a minute.",Date of stay: July 2018,O&B Athens Boutique Hotel,4,"Athens, Greece"
Interesting,Very interesting! Beautiful modern space! Nice views of the Acropolis! Cafe with indoor and outdoor seating. Good reprieve from the heat!,Date of experience: July 2018,Acropolis Museum,4,"Athens, Greece"
"Amazing service! Warm ,professional drivers,","George’s Taxis and Tours was an integral part of our 6 days in Athens. We booked 2 airport transfers, an over night trip to Delphi and Meteora and a transfer to Loggis, Aigos where we had a family event 2 1/2 hours away and the return trip. Nicholas handles the bookings on the internet and he answers all emails promptly and efficiently. He gave us clear information, prices and helpful suggestions. For our transfers to Loggos , Aigos we had no idea where it was but we wanted to include some sight seeing along the way. He made suggestions that turned out to be perfect. Through Q12 emails back and forth , he remained professional and competent.
Our airport transfers with Nicholas and Alexander were perfect. They were waiting for us with a bottle of cold water and drove safely to our hotel. Along the way they included information and a good introduction to Athens- a mini tour per se.
The big trips- to Meteora/ Delphi and transfers to Loggos, Aigos with touring in Ancient Corinth were with Dimitris. I can’t say enough good things about him. He was always punctual, highly informative, flexible and polite. We were unsure if we were going to book a bus tour to Delphi/ Meteora or this private tour. We were so glad we booked with George’s taxi. Demetrius taught us about the countryside all along the way. He stopped at great places to take pictures and gave us lots of tips before entering each place. ( Drivers can’t go into the Attractions.) He brought us to great restaurants. In Meteora, he brought us to a place on the first night where we could see the sunset over the rocks. We sat with a few other tourists on an outcropping of rocks and soaked in the view. The next morning we were able to get to the monasteries before the crowds and buses arrived so that we could have a truly spiritual, moving experience . The hotel that Nicholas arranged for us was Hotel Meteoritis. It was a simple hotel in a quaint town with a beautiful view. Dimitris suggested a nice restaurant for dinner. We were sad to say good bye to him when our 2 day tour was over. Little did we know that he would be our driver for our tours/ transfers to Loggos, Aggie’s . We were so happy to see him. Once again he took care of our trips perfectly- narrating the drives, stopping for pictures, opening doors, carrying luggage. When we got to the hotel in a small town he made sure we were settled before he left. It really was like traveling with a very smart family member!
One thing that must be mentioned is the professionalism of all of the drivers. They all speak English very well.They don’t smoke in the cars. They are very discreet. We were very friendly, comfortable with Dimitris but when he brought us to a restaurant etc he would get us settled but then quietly disappear. When he dropped us off somewhere, we would watch to see us coming back toward the car and materialize from where he was as we approached the car. There were never any awkward moments, looking for him or waiting for him. (We have used private tours in other places and that is not always the case.) This is a very professional service. I highly recommend it.
By the way, when you book they ask for a passport number. They need to do this everywhere in Greece.",Date of experience: July 2018,George's Taxi,4,"Athens, Greece"
"Well paced, informative","We took this tour with Dorina. She was informative, professional and always aware of the safety and comfort of the group. We went up to the Acropolis on a very hot day and she stopped frequently along the way in the shade for people to keep catch their breath. The information was clear and interesting. I would recommend this tour.",Date of experience: July 2018,"Acropolis of Athens, Ancient Agora and the Agora Museum Tour",4,"Athens, Greece"
Fish! Swim! Eat!,"This was an amazing experience. The crew and captain were interesting, friendly and helpful. They only take a few people on the boat. We were 6. We pulled up nets with all kinds of fish and learned about each of them... many of which you probably have never seen if you live in the USA. Then you could relax on the boat, snorkel or fish with hand lines. The captain and crew prepared all of the fish that were just caught- octupus, shrimp, etc Fresh fish straight out of the sea simply prepared on the boat was perhaps the best seafood meal we ever had. If you are looking for a serious fishing trip for big fish, this is not it but if you are looking to learn about traditional Greek fishing vessels, the different kinds of fish around Santorini , swim, relax, eat and do some light fishing this trip is for you. We had a great time! It was one of the highlights of our time in Santorini. *An added plus is that they picked us up and dropped us off at the hotel",Date of experience: July 2018,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
"Clean, comfortable, convenient","This is a very nice simple hotel. The room was clean with a new looking bathroom. The furnishings were simple- a bed, little dressing table, wooden chair and small TV. The bed was very low to the ground and the mattress was hard. The balcony was furnished with a little table and 2 chairs. It had a beautiful view of the rocks. You could easily walk to a few restaurants and shops. It was 10 minutes drive up to the monasteries. It is a very good choice for a night or two.",Date of stay: July 2018,Hotel Meteoritis,4,"Kastraki, Greece"
Clean and convenient,"This is a larger than a bed and breakfast. Different tour groups tend to stay here but that did not disrupt the peacefulness of our stay. The room we had was on the first floor in the back so it did not have a view. It was nicely decorated very much like a chain hotel. It was a little stuffy when we came in but that was quickly remedied by the air conditioner. There is an on site restaurant. Breakfast is not included. The front of the property has beautiful gardens. This property is in walking distance of the Main Street with restaurants, shops, information center, sailing excursions.",Date of stay: July 2017,Auberge Gisele's Country Inn,4,"Cape Breton Island, Canada"
Lovely Inn! Fabulous staff!,"We stayed here one night on a two week trip through Nova Scotia, We decided to stay in Guysborough to attend the Wednesday night ceiliidh. After a long drive, we arrived just in time for dinner. The dinner was excellent and there was an excellent wine list. We couldn't decide if we should buy a bottle of wine since we were rushing to go out. The staff suggested that if we wanted to buy a bottle of wine we could take the remainder to our room for after the Ceilidh. At the end of dinner, she brought us a fresh ice bucket and two clean glasses to take to our room.
Our room was beautifully decorated and quite spacious. The grounds have a lovely garden and deck. It is a short walk to town.",Date of stay: July 2017,DesBarres Manor Inn,4,"Guysborough, Canada"
Convenient and friendly,"During a 2 week trip through Nova Scotia during which we stayed at 9 different bed and breakfasts, we stayed here for 2 nights in the Queen suite. It has a bedroom with a window air conditioner, a sitting room with TV and coffee pot, a large bathroom with a stall shower and side room with a heart shaped jacuzzi and a deck with a table and two chairs.
Although there are some interesting needlepoint samplers on the walls, the rooms are more furnished than decorated. The tub is in a side room with a handmade wood box that feels like it was put there as an after thought so the room does not feel luxurious just crowded. I would not say this was a romantic suite.
There was an air conditioner in the bedroom window. The window in the sitting room opened but sometimes the smells from the kitchen below wafted in. Regardless, the temperature in the room was comfortable.
Where the room was somewhat lacking, the staff was lovely. They asked if we needed anything every time they saw us. They were very kind to give us wine glasses one evening.
Another advantage is that it is in a very convenient location. You can park your car in the off street parking and walk to the Historic Gardens, Fort Anne, The cemetery, shops, the waterfront and other restaurants.
Whether you stay here or not be sure to come here for dinner. The menu is varied. Each thing we ordered was excellent. The service and setting was lovely. It was one of the best meals we had in Nova Scotia.",Date of stay: July 2017,The Garrison House Inn,4,"Annapolis Royal, Canada"

Convenient and comfortable,"We stayed in Parrsboro for 2 nights. This inn is the closest inn to the theater, shops and a fine restaurant in town. Although on a quiet back street, it is only about 2 blocks from Main Street. It really is located in the best of both possible worlds - quiet street, close to the main attractions.
The inn itself is lovely. The common areas are beautifully decorated and there is always coffee, tea and homemade sweets available. Wifi is the best in the common areas.
We stayed in the Black Velvet room. After reading some of the other reviews I thought the wallpaper might be too much but it absolutely was not. Everything was so well decorated and coordinated that it came together as a lovely, exquisite picture. Even the tissue box fit the color pattern. The room was colorful and immaculately clean. The only suggestion would be that the room needed a soft chair to sit in to watch TV.
Breakfast is served every morning. Along with pancakes, eggs or an omelet there is always a special breakfast for the day,
The inn keeper was lovely. She was helpful and tried to anticipate your needs but not intrusive. All in all, this is an excellent choice if you are thinking that you want to stay in Parrsboro.",Date of stay: July 2017,The Maple Inn,4,"Parrsboro, Canada"
Small,This museum has some basic information about the area's geology. It also gives a fair history of the earth.,Date of experience: July 2017,Fundy Geological Museum,4,"Parrsboro, Canada"
Pretty hotel in great location,"This is a small hotel on a side street. It is very close to the waterfront and all of museums, garden and the citadel. Our room was in the second building on the first floor. It was beauriful, clean and quiet. There was even a little balcony on the back that overlooked the garden. There was off street parking. It was the perfect respite from a busy city.
The only problem was that the front desk staff lacked a little polish. We arrived at 2:00 and our room wasn't ready. They said it would be ready in 35 minutes but made no overture to see if we needed to store our luggage. We left it in the car and went for a walk. We came back 45 minutes later and the room still wasn't ready but just a statement of fact. We decided to go on a tour and come back 2 hours later but nothing was said to us to be even a little accommodating - Can we store your luggage? There is a restroom etc.
Checkout went similarly. I said I was checking out and the answer was ""I'll just take the key."" There was no final printed bill even though they had taken my credit card number. There was no "" How was your stay? Was everything okay? Come back again. "" Two other people checked out after me and they seemed a little surprised at the abruptness or lack of warmth. It just seemed odd that an inn as beautiful as this would have such an unpolished staff. I would still stay here because of the location and how pretty the hotel is but the staff needs a little training.",Date of stay: July 2017,The Halliburton,4,"Halifax, Canada"
Quiet and convenient,"Our time at Seascape was relaxing and peaceful. It is a small property but everything you need is high quality. The room was beautiful with a huge picture window overlooking a quiet cove. The furnishings in the room are tasteful and very well maintained. Everything you need is here- a kitchenette with a few pots, dishes and utensils, a coffee pot and coffee , tea and milk in the refrigerator, a hot and cold water dispenser, a fireplace, air conditioner, a pull out table with stools, a grill and 2 chairs on the deck, a TV, toiletries in the bathroom, daily maid service, a full breakfast and as a bonus- seafood appetizers delivered to your door between 4:00 and 5:00. The appetizers are plentiful and delicious. One day we had 6 coconut shrimp. Another day we had 6 bacon wrapped scallops. The breakfast is served between 8:00 and 9:00 and everything we had was excellent. If you can get a reservation for the restaurant, do so. The food was some of the best we had on Cape Breton- beautifully presented and yummy.. Be aware however that they do not serve dinner on Sunday nights. The grounds are beautiful - gardens, cliff walk and hot tub. We stayed 3 nights and wish we could have stayed more.
The retreat is very close to Ingonish Beach, Warren Lake and White Point. If coming from Baddeck, I would suggest you pick up any wine or beer, food etc before you get to the retreat so you don't have to go back. Gas is nearby as are many craft stores.",Date of stay: July 2017,Seascape Coastal Retreat,4,"Cape Breton Island, Canada"

"Service, style and taste","Lovely restaurant in Lewes. Not your run of the mill food. We started with the charcuterie and cheese board which rivaled the best that we' ve had in NYC. The cheeses were carefully chosen so that each was distinct in texture and taste. The meats were unique and also distinct. The pork chop main course was abundant and made perfectly. Pork can be dry if overlooked but this was perfect. The duck was equally good.
The wait staff are very well trained and exhibited the perfect combination of attention and distance. A very lovely experience and well worth the price.",Date of visit: October 2016,Heirloom,4,"Lewes, Delaware"
