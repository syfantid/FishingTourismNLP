Above and Beyond,"Not really one for writing reviews either good or bad. However reflecting on our holiday and just booked next year to Lourdata felt need to write about our numerous visits to Andromeda.

We are well travelled on this wonderful island and all it has to offer and by far the best place for food,atmosphere, friendliness,service and its stunning location is the Andromeda.

The staff go above and beyond to ensure you are well looked after the food is excellent and certainly of the highest standard on the Island.

It is evident the Owner Kostas takes huge pride in the food and service that he provides his guests engaging with everyone to ensure they are welcomed. We certainly felt spoilt not as customers but as returning friends welcomed by an absolute gentleman.

I cannot recommend The Andromeda, Kostas or his staff highly enough and I thank you all for making our stay extra special.

If your near Lourdata certainly pay the Andromeda a visit you have my word you wont be dissapointed.

THANK YOU ANDROMEDA!",Date of visit: July 2019,Andromeda Restaurant,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic Day not to be missed,"Our Second trip yesterday, I did ask myself how this can be bettered from last year....But they did and it was just by keeping it the same.....You are welcomed in such a way that only Kefalonians know how... From the moment you step onboard you can feel the warmth that everyone truly wants you there and wants you to enjoy the day. I donâ€™t do reviews but felt this certainly needed it and can not recommend high enough

Best by Far!!!,"I have been fortunate to travel the world extensively visiting numerous Greek Islands but like so many of us fell in love with Lourdata In Kefalonia.

The Andromeda Restaurant is an absolute gem!!!. In Lourdata..The staff go above and beyond and the owner Kosta a true gentleman ensuring you are well looked after.

The food is of a standard I would expect in a high end restaurant in London at a fraction of the cost and I make a point of trying various dishes during our stay there and I was not disappointed...Well Done Andromeda.

I leave this review (first one I have ever done), safe in the Knowledge that when you visit the Andromeda you will not be dissapointed and can comfortably say that although we tried various others during our stay, Andromeda by far the best!!

Give them a visit and enjoy!!",Date of visit: July 2018,Andromeda Restaurant,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
