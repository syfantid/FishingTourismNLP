Boat trip you will never forget,"An amazing day spent with the crew of Zante Fishing tours.
You get to go aboard an authentic fishing boat, get up close and personal with the 2 crew. The captain makes you feel welcome and wants to make sure the day is on of continual happiness and pleasure. You go out , put out fishing nets and then bathe and swim waiting for your catch . Get the nets in and then the captains mother in law cooks the fish and serves it with spaghetti and bruschetta.
Washed down with wine and laughter.
Best day you could have on board any boat .
Thank you for a wonderful experience.",Date of experience: June 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
