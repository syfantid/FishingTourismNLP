Thank you so much!,"Our family had an amazing time on Dimitrios and Efi’s boat. It was a memorable experience to bring in live fish from the nets and then to participate in preparing them for a exquisite feast. I can still smell the aromas of the fish being cooked tempting us back into the boat soon after we jumped into the magical Ionian sea for a swim. When fish is this fresh, all you need is basic seasoning. Efi and Dimitrios actually collect their own salt and oregano from the island, which is another reason for the unbelievable taste. The white wine also made by Efi and Dimitrios was delicious and a perfect match with our food.

I can go on and on about the food, but just as superb was the multiple stops along beautiful isolated beaches, including the opportunity to have some natural beauty therapy with the famous Kefalonian clay at one of the beaches.

Finally, we can’t speak highly enough of Dimitrios, Efi and their crew member Muhammad. They are beautiful people, and took such great care of us all. It genuinely felt like we were a part of their family.

We will always remember this day and hope to return again. Magical island, magical people, magical memories. Bravo Dimitrios and Efi for a brilliant set up.",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
