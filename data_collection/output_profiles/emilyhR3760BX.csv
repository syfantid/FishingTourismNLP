Excellent day out!,"Giannis is an excellent host aboard his fishing boat. We booked a private trip for 4 people which was very reasonably priced. 3 fishing lines to share was plenty to catch enough for lunch. A nice refreshing dip in a quiet untouched cove followed by beautifully barbequed fish that we caught just hours earlier. The table was laid out beautifully with a fresh salad and complimentary dips to accompany the catch of the day. Giannis's days spent in the kitchen at Poseidon restaurant was most welcome at lunch!
A much recommended trip for those who are passionate about fishing or simply rather enjoy the 5 star views from the front of the boat with a few glasses of local wine",Date of experience: September 2019,Poseidon Fishing Trips,5,"Poros, Greece"
