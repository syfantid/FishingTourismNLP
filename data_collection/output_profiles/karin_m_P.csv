Brilliant experience!,"We can highly recommend Samos fishing trips which was the highlight of our vacation this year. We went on this tour with our three sons aged 3, 9 and 11 and they enjoyed the day as much as we did.

Yanis and Nancy are absolutely brilliant in making sure that everybody onboard the boat is having a great time. Yanis taught our sons how to clean the fish and they where thrilled over the calamaries that he caught. After fishing we went to the most beautiful place to swim and relax while Nancy cooked the most wonderful dinner that we ate on the boat.

Many thanks Yanis and Nancy! We regret that we did not have the opportunity to visit you again in the harbor for a drink together . Next time in Samos we will for sure go on a trip again!",Date of experience: July 2019,Samos Fishing Trips,5,"Samos, Greece"
