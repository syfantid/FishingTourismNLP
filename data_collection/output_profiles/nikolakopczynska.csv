Best place to stay!,"One of the best places to stay! Me and my partner went to Rhodes for a week for my 21st birthday. On arrival they welcome you with a glass of champagne and little snack, afterwards they check you in and the gentlemen takes you to your room with the luggage. As it was my birthday, when I entered the room the was a birthday cake waiting for me, sparkling wine and birthday wishes from the hotel which I want to thank you very much for! Also, we got a lovely room with a Jacuzzi bath and a view which depends on the hotel availability. Very nice and friendly staff, especially Zaffy :) Hotel very beautifully decorated, food absolutely amazing, plenty of choices. The only one thing the hotel could improve on is the snack bar by the pool during the day other than that everything was perfect! Taxi from the airport is 20 euros, taxi to Town between 11-14 euros. We rented a quad bike for 40 euros for 24hrs and went to see a lot of plates ourselves, that was much cheaper then getting a taxi around. Weather was also amazing, we went on 28th April - 5th May and it was 27-32 degrees hot!!
I will definitely be back again and I 100% recommend this hotel.",Date of stay: May 2018,The Ixian Grand,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Okayish,"I would say this trip in more for older people :) it was a bit boring, not expensive. Between Â£22-27 euros.",Date of experience: May 2018,Sea Dreams,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Amazing and cheap!,"Absolutely amazing! 50 euros per person for 4.5hrs trip from New Town (opposite Starbucks coffee shop) 10 minutes drive from Sentido Ixian Grand hotel (11-14euros taxi). My boyfriend is a fisher man so we decided to go, they give you rods, you get to fish, I got to catch 3 and so did my boyfriend! After fishing you get to swim in very nice clear water, then they barbecue the fishes that everyone catches, served with salad and sparkling wine.9-10 people on the boat maximum, very nice experience, worth the money, the lady Joanna will talk you through everything before booking it :) I would definitely recommend it 100% ! Have a look at the lovely pictures I have attached.",Date of experience: May 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
