Amazing.. just amazing!,"Antonia and the crew went above and beyond for is all day! The best fishing trip my son (7) and I have ever been on! Worth going back to Kefalonia for this alone! The food was stunning and my son even enjoyed the red mullet-
Whilst I preferred the freshest lobster ever Would highly recommend to everyone!!!",Date of experience: May 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Little bit rubbish,"Just returned from 5 night stay in Santa Fe Hotel with my 5 year old son. Just the two of us travelling and it was by far from adequate or child friendly. The room was clean enough, and I liked that they changed the bedding daily. However, no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. I think you can request a kettle, but this proved to be more hassle than its worth as reception was always engaged, and I couldn't leave my 5 year old alone in the room to go and get one. The TV options - for when you are chilling out in your room, 5 channels 2 for children...but one was a safety message on a loop with Timone and Pumba - hardly entertaining.Fortunately I had brought the ipad which we opted for over the TV in the room. The food was appalling. Its a buffet, but does it really have to be the same every night, chilli, wraps, chicken or pizza? I'm was really not convinced the plates were ever clean - they were always wet from the dishwasher (I assume) when we picked them up.One evening we were so tired from the park, and the thought of La Cantina was soul destroying, we opted for a Starbucks sandwich instead. Breakfast was the same every day as well. No hot options at all. The only reason we returned to La Cantina was out of exhaustion and ease...! I will not be returning to this hotel.",Date of stay: August 2017,Disney's Hotel Santa Fe,4,"Coupvray, France"
