Amazing day with fabulous food and great company,"We have just arrived back fro a wonderful day with Antonia and Michalis on their boat. There were 12 guests - English Italian and Dutch (with a smattering of Columbian and Sri Lankan).
We arrived at the boat to be greeted with authentic Greek coffee and homemade cake and set sail towards Dias. The journey was magical watching the sun rise above the mountain. Our first stop was to start drawing in the nets - 2 kilometres worth although Antonia told us that on a standard fishing trip they haul in 12km! The nets had caught all sorts of fish and a few lobsters. When completed we moved on towards Spartia and dropped anchor at a sheltered cove where we could dive or in my case take the steps into the crystal clear water to swim and snorkel. Time for a snack - freshly made Riganado - all the ingredients from Antonias garden. More swimming and chilling whilst lunch was cooked - the smells were fabulous and the end product by far the best fish I have eaten in 25 years on the island all washed down by a very pleasant home made white wine. It truly was a lovely day excellent value for money and we have come away having made new friends and great memories. Thank you Antonia and Michalis J and M xx",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Wonderful home from home,"From the moment we arrived Penny made us feel more than welcome showing us into the sitting room with log stove burning and offering us tea and cake. Our room was delightful, spacious with a lovely comfortable bed. After sleeping extremely well we were treated to a delicious breakfast, my husband opting for the traditional Bacon and Eggs but on this occasion enhanced by homemade potato cakes whilst I opted for smoked salmon and scrambled eggs - so good I had to have it the next morning too. Breakfast was served in Penny's lovely conservatory a great way to start the day. we will definitely be going back and I would certainly recommend Torridge House to anyone wanting to stay in Appledore Jane",Date of stay: November 2017,Torridge House Bed & Breakfast,4,"Appledore, United Kingdom"
