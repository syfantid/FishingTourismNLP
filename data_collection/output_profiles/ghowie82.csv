Fantastic Evening!,"My husband had booked this trip a few weeks before arriving in Kefalonia.
Antonia had contacted us the day before our trip to advise that the weather would not be good (windy) therefore the trip would need to be cancelled. Although we were disappointed this shows that saftey of customers comes first regardless of the loss of income to them.

To our delight Antonia had arranged
the sunset trip for us instead on another day. We really appreciated the extra hours her and her team members put in for this trip to go ahead.

It was a fantastic experience and my 2 boys (age 7 & 11) absolutely loved it. Snorkeling in the sea and dinner at sunset, beautiful!!

Dont be worried if you have fussy eating children, Antonia has this covered, she had asked me if the kids would be ok with the food that was served, so no one will go hungry!

I have to say the food served on board was amazing!!! The best meal of my holiday from start to finish, the past was the best I've ever had!!!

Highly recommend this trip!!!",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
