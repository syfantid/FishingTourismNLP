Best day of our hols,"Great experience and good value - lesson on how to fish, snorkelling, and a really good meal consisting of fish caught that day (even if you caught none you still got an equal portion). Thanks for a great day!",Date of experience: August 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
Lovely,"Lovely place, lovely food. Clay pigeon shooting and the spa were spot on. Every staff member I spoke to was nice and helpful! However, I kept getting gin and tonics after asking for gin and lemonade (they were happy to replace though)",Date of stay: June 2018,The Coniston Hotel Country Estate & Spa,5,"Coniston Cold, United Kingdom"
