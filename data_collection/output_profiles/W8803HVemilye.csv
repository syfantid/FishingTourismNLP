"Highly recommended, we loved it!","We took the semi private sunset tour, and loved every minute of it!

Anthi (the captain of the boat) was brilliant. She was knowledgeable about all the fish we caught and ate, and was also very warm and welcoming. She taught us some of the tricks of the trade, including how to eat the fish we caught!

In addition to the fishing, we swam in a beautiful bay, and after eating a huge amount of delicious fish, we watched the sunset.

There were only a small number of us on the boat, which meant the tour felt very private and special!

Thank you so much.",,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
