An unforgetable experience!,"A fishing cruise by ""Dimitrios-Efthimia"" is something that i will never forget!I had the most amazing and fun time. The hospitable and friendly Dimitris and Efthimia taught us a lot of intresting things about fishing and after the fishing experience we went to an isolated beach and we had a lot of time to enjoy the crystal clear waters while the sweat eftimia prepared for us the most delicius meal. Even if i was alone i came so close with the other 6 people that at the end we became friends!I am so glad that i tried something so uniqe and its definately an experience that i recommend to someone who will vistit the island of Kefalonia!If i had the chance i would do it again!!",Date of experience: July 2016,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
