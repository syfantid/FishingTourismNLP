A really great and unique experience!,I went with Captain Nick on one of his first trips and i experienced something totally different from what i lived so far. A great boat trip to some amazing beaches in Kimolos and Polyegos combined with real fishing during the trip. When you swim Nick and Froso are cooking the fish and then everybody is eating together an extremely delicious lunch. I totally recommend it!!!!,Date of experience: August 2017,Milos Fishing Experience,5,"Milos, Greece"
