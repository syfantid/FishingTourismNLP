Feel like I got ripped off,Just ordered a bacon and chicken baguette and was charged £5. That seems way too steep for what it is. Greggs is less that £4 for the same.,Date of visit: February 2020,The Orchard Cafe,1,"Brentwood, United Kingdom"
Absolutely perfect,"Booked after reading all the TA reviews. As soon as we got onboard we could tell that we were in good hands. Coffee and freshly baked cake to start the morning was amazing. We traveled out to the fishing nets laid out before and watched Antonio and Hassan work together to bring them in. Soon enough we were rewarded with a large lobster closely followed by its smaller siblings. With enough lobster and fish to feed the boat we headed for a little secluded bay where lunch was prepared for us.

The new found crew got on like a house on fire and we enjoyed each other’s company tremendously. We chatted while lunch was prepared and soon enough plans were being made to continue the day when we got back to shore.
Lunch was amazing.
A beautiful fish soup full of flavour was our first course. Second course was a table full of fresh salad, spaghetti and of course the prized catch of the day - the lobster. Fresh sweet melon to top it all off we were stuffed.

After lunch and another swim we headed back to the port and said our good-byes to our hosts Antonio, Michalis and Hassan. We had a great day and learnt a great deal but the highlight was that we felt like family from the very first minute we met them. We all came together and had the best possible day which continued at our new crew mates hotel pool not far from the port. The conversation was dominated by the days events which is a testament to Antonia, Michalis Hassan and all those we met onboard.

Just book it!,"Ideally located, Nestled on the hill, just above the main town centre. We found that this was more than just a backpackers!When we arrived we met a wonderful couple(Rocío & Ryaan) and their kids. They checked us in and showed us our room. We had a private room with an ensuite. The room was more ,much more than you'd expect from a backpackers and very clean. The atmosphere,which is mostly down to the managers, is that of a relaxing oasis where weary travellers can relax, have a beer and share their tales. In my books exactly what a backpackers should be like. We enjoyed a Braai with Rocío, Riaan and other travellers on the Saturday night which rounded off our trip to Knysna on a high!
Overall - a wonderful place which won't disappoint. You won't be sorry you booked and you will book again.
Thank you so much Rocío & Riaan for making our stay enjoyable and one we won't forget. Thank you for making a special trip even more special!
All the best

Below average.....below basic standards,"We didnt expect alot because you get what you pay for but i do expect the basics or atleast whats advertised.
The pictures on the Sonmez website are not the rooms we stayed in and are possibly from either a family room or the apartments.Our rooms were tiny, dirty and below standard.
Rooms did have aircon but this is an additional £3 pound charge a day and not inlcuded as advertised on their website. We tried not to use it but eventually had to to get a decent nights sleep. A fridge was located in the passageway and not in our room. This could be moved into our room and used if you could find the space and again pay an additional £3 a day. There is no tea of coffee making facilities but if you want a ketlle then.....you guessed it £3 a day. The rooms were not cleaned daily and towels were either too small or infact floor mats. The showers dont work. They are either Scorching hot or freezing cold but you manage to clean yourself when the water changes from either hot to cold or the the other way round.

The bar snack menu leaves alot to be desired although you could survive.
The resturant has a really good looking evening menu but as we never ate there due to the experiance of the snack menu I wont coment on it but could only say that it is the same kitchen and staff.

The other guests in the hotel were lovely but we spent alot of time around the pool telling our horror story's and bad experiance. All in all we all had the same opinion. We would never return!!!
The hotel is in a lovely location and the beech and surrounding towns are easy to get to but there are other places to stay in the same area.

The owners/managers are ok. Sue will not bother you cause she doesnt seem to get involved in anything. She seems to just do her washing and laze about the pool. If she does chat to you she is pleasant. ""Jimmy will fix it"" as he likes to be called seems to be focused on giving guests nothing for as much money as possible. All in all a poor show from the owners who should be trying to retain clients for future visits.
You really need to watch your spending at the bar if you run a tab because we all found stuff on our tabs we never had. Best to pay cash everytime. Also there are no card facilities at either the bar or the resturant.

The good bit. The pool wasnt bad and the beer was cold at an average price.

To some up we would never return and this opinion was shared by most of the guests.",Date of stay: August 2009,Sonmez Hotel,1,"Oludeniz, Turkey"
