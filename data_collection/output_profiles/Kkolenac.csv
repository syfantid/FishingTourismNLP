Unforgoten adventure MUST TRY üëåüèª,"It was an unforgettable day and I would be very sorry that I would not take part in this excursion, fishing. As soon as we boarded the boat, they served us with excellent coffee, biscuits. Captain Giorgios is very friendly and hospitable, as well as his crew. The fish that we caught with the grid were prepared for lunch and they were excellent, and we all had a choice of drinks in an unlimited quantity all day. We also took a couple of beaches where we could swim. He makes sure you feel great and remember the adventure. It's a must try Fishing tour on Zante.
