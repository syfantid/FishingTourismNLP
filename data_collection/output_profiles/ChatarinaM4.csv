An amazing experience!,"The fishing, the beaches and the incredible good lunch consisting of freshly caught fish and lobster, everything will be a memory for life!
Dimitrios and Efi were so nice and very good hosts, they showed us their work and their island and took very good care of us! It was a really great day! I would definitely recommend it.",Date of experience: June 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
