Amazing holiday,"We have just had the most amazing time at the magnolia resort,every aspect of the hotel was spotless.The staff were wonderful,nothing was too much trouble,they were always cheerful and professional.Like many people I checked reviews on the resort prior to booking,one of the main issues seemed to be related to breakfast which I found more than adequate,there were at least 3 types of bread every day,3 different cereals,fresh fruit,tinned fruit,Greek yogurt,bacon,scrambled egg,fruit juice etc,etc...My conclusion is,if you want a relaxing holiday,beautifully clean pool,peaceful surroundings and lots of gorgeous authentic Greek food then book the magnolia resort,,,,if you want a full English or pie and mash try blackpool",Date of stay: September 2018,Magnolia Resort,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
The best experience on kefalonia,"We have just returned from a holiday on the beautiful island of kefalonia,the highlight of our 2 week stay was the days fishing trip that we experienced with Dimitrios and Efi,they were wonderful hosts and Efisâ€™ cooking of the catch was amazing,if anyone is thinking of going to kefalonia this trip is a MUST. Another nice touch is that there were only 8 guests,so plenty of room to move around the boat,very relaxed,coupled with the fishing we stopped at several beautiful beaches for a lovely swim and cool down...Thank you Dimitrios and Efi,,,we have wonderful and fond memories thanks to you",Date of experience: September 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Crystal cove excellent,"What can I say about crystal cove that hasn't already been said,we've been back in the U.K. for a few hours and felt that I needed to post a review asap,the resort is beautiful,kept spotless by a team whom never seem to stop,every single member of staff treated us with politeness and professionalism,we were in room 201,classed as a garden view,we had just as good a view of the sea,as a photographer whose passion is wildlife this room couldn't have been better as every morning I was treated to lots of hummingbird action,,,,now the only criticism,and this is purely constructive,the bathroom needed a little TLC,but was functional all the same...Top marks crystal cove",Date of stay: March 2017,Crystal Cove By Elegant Hotels,5,Barbados
Awesome,"One of the most amazing wonders in Barbados,a very informative and fascinating experience,the work undertaken to excavate these caves and create the tourist attraction is quite staggering.A great day for all the family young and old,easily accessible and spotlessly maintained,you are taken through the caves on a electrical tram,so open to all abilities,a must to all who visit Barbados",Date of experience: March 2017,Harrison's Cave,5,Barbados
Beautiful,"A must location to see all of the islands diverse plant life,peaceful,tranquil and beautiful.Only a couple of hours to walk around the grounds,but there is also a well equipped give shop and well priced cafe area with outside seating surrounded by well established gardens with the local birdsong to add to the experience,keep an eye out for the many busy humming birds that frequent the gardens",Date of experience: March 2017,Flower Forest,5,Barbados
