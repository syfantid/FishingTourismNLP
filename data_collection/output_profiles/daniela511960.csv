This is a must,"Today will be about Kefalonia, Efthimia and Dimitrios.
Kefalonia is my favourite island from the 7 Greek island I‚Äôve seen so far. And Efthimia and Dimitrios will be, from now on, one more reason for that. They are my favourite tour hosts, ever. The food Efthimia cooks ( fresh, catch of the day fish, sea food and vegetables) is delicious; Dimitrios is funny, communicative and helpful. Their small boat is spotless, and comfortable. For those who, like me, had no idea about net fishing, it is very instructive, too. Don‚Äôt miss this experience, if you are in Kefalonia. It‚Äôs a must.
And now about Kefalonia : as in all the Ionian Sea islands, water is unbelievable clear, and in 50 shades of ...blue. It changes colors,depending on the moment of the day.
At this time of the year the water is rather cold, but refreshing, all in all. People are friendly and helpful and speak English quite well. There are lots of guests houses, b&b, hotels. The entire island is full of small, cosy villages, each and every one of it with its special feature. As the island is practically a mountain in the middle of the sea you‚Äôll definitely need a car, as everywhere you go, you‚Äôll have to go up and down on windy roads. The views are amazing, breathtaking, wherever you look. And it‚Äôs not crowded if you chose to come beginning of June or late August, beginning of September.I don‚Äôt know exactly about July and August but most certainly it might be too hot. Depending on your interests, the hosts of your guests house will advise you. Argostoli the capital, is a nice, clean and neat city, with something for everybody( fancy restaurants and hotels, dancing clubs, local designers shops, playgrounds for children ) but if you prefer just to relax and enjoy a good bath in Cristal clear waters and white, yellow, black sand, look for lodging in the villages scattered all over the moutains. You won‚Äôt regret it.",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
One of the best,"This is a nice, cozy restaurant; very good food
good service and moderate prices. It must be even better in the summer or spring as they have a terrace. I definitely go there again.",Date of visit: December 2017,Blue Margarita,4,"Bucharest, Romania"
Leisure,"I‚Äôm not a fan of zoos. So I went there more out of curiosity to see how bad it is though Singapore is one of the most civilized, clean, safe city, I‚Äôve visited. So how bad could it be ?Inside this zoo, the animals seem almost free and happy as they are not kept in cages, but in huge replica of their natural enviroment. Nice experience, worth a visit for kids sake at least; It was much better than I‚Äôve expected, my only ‚Äúcomplaint ‚Äú is that polar bear , is also on display there; and no matter how hard they try to replicate their natural enviroment, they(the polar bears) are not suited to live in a tropical climate; they seem ok, but an arctic sea can hardly be replaced by a partly frozen swimming pool, no matter how big it is. Or by freezing air conditioning. Luckily the bears can‚Äôt talk. Other than that....
Food courts and coffe shops are all over the place, lot of greens, playgrounds for kids. You can spend an entire day there easily.And the kids will love it. But again, I‚Äôm against zoos or any other form of caged animals.

Tips and tricks- By public transport, it might take 1 hour to get there from city center, and it‚Äôs rather complicated by car. If you don‚Äùt have a rented car
with updated navigation system,use google maps and public transport wich are great and very cheap. You can buy a sim card for data, for your phone with 15 Singapore $ and a public transport card with about the same price for
7-10 days. Actually you don‚Äôt need a car in Singapore; google maps and public transport can save you a lot of money, as parking lots are quite expensive.Metro/underground is also very good,but by bus you can see more of the city. And at rush hour, bus or metro are better to use There are also Sight seeing buses, on 8 routes! We preferred to walk or take the bus (which are air conditioned) when we couldn‚Äôt stand the heat..
Hope my review will help you decide.",Date of experience: December 2017,Singapore Zoo,4,"Singapore, Singapore"
Something else,"This temple is located in little India which is in itself a very special place. Some might find both of them kitschy but that‚Äôs what makes it so picturesque : it‚Äôs very colored, very crowded, noisy, but likable. It‚Äôs very different from all you might have seen anywhere else, unless you‚Äôve been to India. There are always a lot of people wandering inside,outside and around the temple. It‚Äôs like entering, visiting and exiting India in 2 hours.Everything is very colorful inside the temple, all the walls are full of little Buddhas in different posture. Thousands of them ! A visit to the temple and little India,
can give you the feeling of India, without going to India. I loved it and I recommend a visit to both the temple and little India. There are a lot of restaurants, small shops,gold shops, toy shops,henna tattoo shops, it‚Äôs like a walk in a huge mall, always overcrowded but mysteriously not annoying.
I don‚Äôt think a lot of people like crowded
places but these two, worth trying, even so.",Date of experience: December 2017,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum,4,"Singapore, Singapore"
The best üöá,"The cleanest, fastest,cheapest, safest way of transport √Æn Singapore. A 10 days pass costs 15 $ and you can go anywhere with it.",Date of experience: December 2017,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT),4,"Singapore, Singapore"
China town,"Very much like any other china town but better. Good food, lots of shops, many cheap decent hotels/hostels.",Date of experience: December 2017,Chinatown,4,"Singapore, Singapore"
Leasure,"Apart from a not very comfy bed and nice location this is a bad choice. We stayed there 4 days; during this time nobody neither cleaned our room or took the garbage out or change the towels.You don't even have 2 glasses or 2 chairs to sit on, and the small carpets
were very dirty, the bathroom was dirty and not working very well, the door was not closing well. The breakfast was not bad, but you have to ask for each and everything and the food was obviously a day old.At the bar they overcharged us. The staff was not interested in their clients comfort.They seemed undisturbed every time we complained about anything .They fixed the bathroom but not cleaned the room, as if you have to ask for it. And they pretend they have only one key of the room.
I've choosen this small hotel because it has good reviews (8,1)
It proved to worth less than 6. I've stayed in lots of places, in the middle of nowhere and it was cleaner than here! For 50‚Ç¨/night all they offer is a bed and a roof above your head.
I wouldn't recomend it! Don't go there !",Date of stay: July 2017,Pensiunea Sara,4,"Valiug, Romania"
A hidden treasure,"Beside the unbelievable view, the food is delicious! You can enjoy the sun set ,listen to good music, watch the mountains, have a great lunch or dinner. What more can you ask to have a stunning day ?
It's at about 10km from Perigiali , and the road goes up and down through the mountains offering wonderful views. The nice part is that in 30 minutes you can go from the beach to the mountains; but that's all about Greek islands. Don't miss it !",Date of visit: June 2017,Rachi,4,"Lefkada, Greece"
A wonderful lunch,"Very good food , nice location , very friendly staff. And good prices.It's worth trying! Greek islands should be seen at least once in life time ! It's hard , being around 700 but worth trying! And Lefkada is one of the most beautiful and offering island.",Date of visit: June 2017,Taverna Pantazis,4,"Lefkada, Greece"
How can you choose ?,"This must be a very famous beach , by now; but seeing it is something else . The ""sand"" it's made of big and small round rocks wich give you a nice masage to your feet ; the waters are clear and in tens shades of green and blue ; near by there are a lot of small tavernas and shops . But isn't it the same on all greek beaches ? At least the ones at the Ionic sea . Then how can you decide wich to see and wich to skip in a 7 days holiday ? Tough choice !

Tip : you better have some water shoes at hand ; sometimes the nice little rocks could be very hot .
And a sun umbrella it can be useful as sun can be really hot sometimes , and there is no place to hide or any shaded places . ....except for the taverna teraces .",Date of experience: June 2017,Porto Katsiki,4,"Lefkada, Greece"
A must see/go,"This one as most of the others is of breathtaking beauty. But be advised : you have to climb 75 steps and them descend pretty much the same number of steps , in order to get there . But it's worth the effort ! Don't forget your sun umbrella and lotions !

Tip : there are a lot of restaurants and shops before starting to climb ; make sure you have all you need(beer, snacks) before starting .It's a 20 minutes walk , but in the hot sun it can take a little more.",Date of experience: June 2017,Milos Beach,4,"Lefkada, Greece"
Very good,"This is a nice small hotel ; very clean and tidy with a nice small garden .Very well located on the main street in Perigiali . Owners very nice and helpful always present and ready to help .Very good breakfast on a wonderful roof terrace . Small beach just across the road. Restaurants and bars , at a small walking distance .
I surely recomend it .
The only issue is that it may be a little noisy for some people as it is located on a main and rather busy street. It was not an issue for us, but it can be for some people .",Date of stay: June 2017,Sundy's Studios,4,"Lefkada, Greece"
Not bad,"This is a thing to remember : the ugliest , untidy, kitchish restaurant I've ever been in . The food was ok, but in very small quantity. And I don't mean the usual traditional corean side dishes .We had barbecue of pork and cow ; the meat was tasty but I don't think both dishes weighted more than 200g (the actual meat). The waiters were sloppy and seemed bothered by our presence. Except for us , there was only one table taken : the customers were corean. Even more disappointing was that the set menus they offer were very expensive by any standards. Aren't set menus meant to be cheaper than the usual menu? The price was huge for 200g of meat , some vegetables and sauce (50‚Ç¨) Not mentioning that if you want to grill yourself, at/on the table, your cloths would absorb all the smell, as there was no ventilation near by.
Our first experience with corean food was in New York and we loved it; the food was excellent and plentiful and the price was fare ; not mentioning the waiters who were more than helpful .
So we were very glad hearing there is one in our city; but after eating there ......we'll wait for our next trip to NY in order to eat corean food. I would rather not recommend it , unless you have no choice.There are a lot of good Asian restaurants in my city. Seoul is not one of them .",Date of visit: May 2017,Seoul Restaurant Korean,4,"Bucharest, Romania"
A very nice bistro/restaurant,"This is a must in Bucharest ; good music,sometimes live, good tasty food (pizzas, pastas, meats)and nice terrace/open air garden.And almost every night there is something going on : live jazz music, theater. A very nice place for a night out . And every year in May , the green hours jazz festival ! I really love this place .",Date of visit: May 2017,Green Hours Jazz Cafe,4,"Bucharest, Romania"
It's worth it !,"This is a nice small town ; full of antics shops and restaurants, bars .For vintage collectors of anything is heaven ! Every thursday there is a good flea market with food , cloth and everything else .Stroll along the narrow streets and you'll find small fashion boutiques . There is also a very nice public garden with a small chateau which looks like the house in Psycho movie (chateau Giraud) . And the small river Sorgue wich runs thourgh the middle of a large boulevard with very old water mills ,still working ,in the middle.All in all it's worth a visit !
Tip : park at the first parking lot you run into when entering the city Inside the city , there are not any parking spaces as all streets are very narrow. We came from Avignon and the first parking lot was next to a U-tille super market and it was ok at 1,50‚Ç¨/hour (which is cheap for France). Plus along the way to the city centre , there are some exquisite antics shops and Fashion boutiques .",Date of experience: May 2017,L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue Market,4,"L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, France"
It's a good restaurant for a short brake,"We've been here on a rainy day ; even so ,it was a good idea. Very nice small medieval village . Nice helpful staff at Promenade de Justin. And you can not beat the view. Good tasty food for the money !",Date of visit: May 2017,La Promenade de Justin Sebastien,4,"Sault, France"
This is really the garden,"Saintes Maries de la mer is a really nice village ; I think it's really popular among the French people in the area , but little known by many others . It's loaded with nice hotels ,restaurants and bars , wonderful beaches and a lot of gypsies . It was very crowded though it was on a Monday afternoon we've been there . I wonder how is it during summer .
Le jardin des Delices it's one of the best sea food restaurants I had lunch in . The Fish soup is tasty and plentyful , les moulles gratine are also very good . They also have set menus , (formulles) at decent prices and they are very tasty .Set menus start at around 20‚Ç¨ , untill 40‚Ç¨ .But make sure you are very hungry ! And be aware that many restaurants in France , only serve lunch until 2 pm . Between 2 and 6pm , few are serving lunch . Les jardin des Delices is one of them ! Make a reservation in advance or wait 20-30 minutes for a table .",Date of visit: May 2017,Le Jardin des D√©lices,4,"Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, France"
A well kept secret,"This is a lovely resort village . Full of little hotels and hostels , restaurants and bars and wonderful beaches . Prices are decent both for food and lodging .
They have a big Marina where you can hire a boat for fishing or leisure . Parking might be a problem if you arrive after 11 pm , but in the end you'll find a place ; you better go as far as possible from the city center .
They have a very old arena where concerts are taking place and from time to time some bull contests .
All in all , it's worth a visit .
The best fish restaurant is Les jardins des Delices but I'm sure all of them are rather good .",Date of experience: May 2017,Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer Beach,4,"Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, France"
Good hotel,"Good quiet hotel for the money ; it also has a nice swimming pool ; but be informed : you'll be charged 60‚Ç¨/day/room deposit as warranty for any damage you may cause . And 2.03‚Ç¨/day city tax.It is a little too much in my opinion and it was not specified anywhere when I've made the reservation(I mean the 60‚Ç¨ deposit) luckily I had money on my card ! This ""tax"" will be refund on your departure if everything is ok . And also the parking is 10‚Ç¨/day . I think it's good to know . The breakfast is 16.50‚Ç¨/person and is very good .
In the near by caffe ( 15 minutes walk) 1 croissant+1 coffee=7‚Ç¨ ; it depend on what kind of breakfast you are used to . I had the one at the hotel as breakfast is main meal for me .For snacks and other necessities there is a carrefour express at a 15 minutes walk from the hotel ; just turn right when exiting the hotel, go straight ahead and then cross the road at the second gate , to the left, and go straight ahead ; you'll see the logo of carrefour on your right . On your right before crossing the road you'll see the railway station where you might find some cheap basic breakfast. On this street ( rue de la Republique) you'll find a lot of restaurants and bar and shops .",Date of stay: May 2017,Novotel Avignon Centre,4,"Avignon, France"
Best barbecue in town,"This is the best grilled meat I've ever eaten in years . Though not cheap ( 100$/small combo for 2) it's worth every penny . Be prepared to wait in line between 20 to 40 minutes to get a table , as you can not book in advance. On arrival , register at the counter and the nice girl will tell you how long it will take . Even so , it worth the waiting . Besides the tasty meat , the way they grille it right in front of you , at/on the table ,it's unique ; they also give you a lot of seasoning sauces, condiments, salads and side dishes. Although small size , there was enough food for 2 hungry people . The large size , might be too much .The waiters are very nice and helpful. Although it's always crowded, you eat quite fast after you get the table . Excellent !",Date of visit: April 2017,Baekjeong NYC,4,"New York City, New York"
A good value for the money,"A very comfortable and clean hotel . Staff very helpful and carrying. Like all the hotels by Affinia .

Tips and tricks : you can have a cheap and tasty breakfast at Lucia's cafe (7-8$ for a tasty cheese and ham croissant +cofee)
To get there , turn right on exiting the hotel . You can't miss it.
The nearest subway stop is at about 3 blocks away (5-10minutes walk). Go to the roof top terrace at the 16th floor for a nice view of the surroundings; during summer there is also a bar there .
And if you like Korean /asiatic food , go on 32nd street (5 blocks away to the right) plenty of choices",Date of stay: April 2017,Shelburne Hotel & Suites by Affinia,4,"New York City, New York"
This is the place,"Concerning shopping in Washington DC , this is THE PLACE .Though it is a rather long trip , if you don't have a car ,it's worth the effort .At Potomac Mills outlet you can find both de luxe brands and the more affordable ones. Be advised if you use public transport : after taking the blue subway to the Pentagon you have to take a bus too ; this one will take you to the outlet and is about 40 minutes long drive ; on your way back, the bus stop is IN FRONT of the BUY BUY BABY store and it has a fixed schedule , so you better check on your arrival ( at 7.20 pm and 8.09 is the last one).
You can very well spend an entire day over there ( and a lot of money too).",Date of experience: April 2017,Potomac Mills,4,"Woodbridge, Virginia"
A very nice hotel,"This is our second stay at 50NYC AFFINIA and for good reasons : very well located , very nice and helpful staff ; special thanks to Cristina who was of great help We'll surely be back and I recommend it with all my heart to my friends.",Date of stay: April 2017,Fifty Hotel & Suites by Affinia,4,"New York City, New York"
The best pub/restaurant in town,"This is an already old pub , very good ; and it stayed very good for years . The owners are very careful and change the menu all the time so that the customers don't get bored . The atmosphere is friendly and safe , even for single ladies .
The prices are medium to high , but worth every penny .",Date of visit: January 2017,IRISH PUB,4,"Constanta, Romania"
Very good,"One of the oldest in Marbella ; nice comfortable , clean rooms . Although quite old , very well taken care of . Very good location .Very nice staff .Good breakfast. I recommend it . Ask for a room with sea view and balcony. Entertainment every night . Very , very nice.",Date of stay: December 2016,Hotel Fuerte Marbella,4,"Marbella, Spain"
Dinner,"Though I see people have good opinions on this restaurant ,my experience was very disappointing : beside the fact we've waited more than half an hour that somebody notice us , the food was undercooked and tasteless . As it was not crowded at all ,they can't have this excuse . I've been in Spain several times and everywhere the food was excellent no matter how well known or unknown the restaurant was ; this time , though they have a badge from you , I can not say something good about it .
We barely touched the food but the waiter never asked why ,when clearing the table . And we waited another 20 minutes to pay for something we hadn't eat . And there were only 5-6 tables occupied , not more than 20 people having lunch . Thus I would advise to avoid this restaurant at all costs.",Date of visit: December 2016,El Jardin,4,"Malaga, Spain"
Dinner,"A good neighbourhood small restaurant ; good pizzas and pasta and a big choice of lebanese cuisine and a very good service ; and they have a small terasse for sunny days ; good prices and they deliver too . I'd recomend it as an alternative to big luxurious restaurants of the neighbourhood.
It's the right informal place to eat , when you either don't feel like going too far from home or cooking , but you need to eat .",Date of visit: November 2016,Sheikh,4,"Voluntari, Romania"
Big doubts,"This is a very expensive restaurant/ caffeteria/bar . Don't get me wrong but it's not that the food or anything else is not good (it's excellent) but it's far to expensive . I've rated very good only because the food is good . You better go there , invited by someone else or on pay day .",Date of visit: November 2016,Le Grenier a Pain,4,"Bucharest, Romania"
A must see,"This is a very nice little castle ; you can see some wonderful art nouveau , Belle √âpoque, decorated interiors ; by request you can have a guide who can give you all the information you need . It's worth seeing it . But try not to go on weekends , it's crowded and you 'll stand in the queues.",Date of experience: November 2016,Peli»ôor Castle,4,"Sinaia, Romania"
Lunch,"This restaurant is already rated by TripAdvisor ; and I've seen why : it's a very good , affordable restaurant . The service is good and the food excellent ; the prices are also ""friendly"". The menu is traditional and tasty . But don't go there on weekends unless you have a reservation and you are not very hungry : you'll have to wait some time before you eat . Anyway I'll recommend it , eyes closed .",Date of visit: November 2016,Snow,4,"Sinaia, Romania"
A very nice hotel,"This is a boutique hotel with a lot of charm ; built in the forest , without damaging it , it is actually built around trees . The restaurant is very good , built on a platform and you can see rabbits and squirrels wondering around .The food is also exquisite with a good wine menu . But everything comes with a price : rooms starts at 100‚Ç¨ /night , food also 100‚Ç¨ for 2 people . But worth every penny .",Date of stay: November 2016,Ioana Hotel,4,"Sinaia, Romania"
Leisure,"This is a very good resort ; you have everything you need to feel relaxed and have a great holiday . The food is very good , the cabins on the beach are nice and comfortable but if you need internet , forget about it : it's very very slow and it comes with a price ( 75$/ 10 days ) but you can have it
free in the loby and at the bar . As it works bad everywhere , it's cheaper this way. Do bring chocolates and snacks with you , specially if you come with kids , as the ones you can find in the minibar and at the local shop are very expensive (3,46$/ for a 50g toblerone) In fact everything you can buy hear , ITS very expensive . And there are no water activities for free ; nothing at all . I say that because on another island I've been , there were some . But you can use the fitness , badminton , tenis volley and squash court for free .
And it takes an aditional 30 minutes to get there , after you landed in Male , (20 min by small Plane , and 10 minutes by boat ) .
The staff is very nice and helpful and do their best to make you feel good though they sure need an english refersher course .
Any way it's worth coming here .
I can't tell you the price for a holiday , as it's different , depending where are you coming from ; for instance , from Rom√¢nia , an 11 nights trip for 2 , costs 2160‚Ç¨ by TUI , with half board , without the plane tickets .",Date of stay: September 2016,Royal Island Resort & Spa,4,Horubadhoo Island
Good restaurant near the Baneasa forest,"A nice restaurant . With a nice garden and very good service . Prices are rather expensive for the locals , but fair :50-70‚Ç¨ / 2 persons. A good range of food ; they have both Mediterranean menu and asiatic menu ; ask for broccoli cream soup if you go there ; it's delicious .
As it is obviously dedicated to the expats living in the area and it is very popular among them . The only small problem it's with the noise from the cars rolling very near by . Anyway the management
surrounded the garden with lots of trees and green so to lower the noise .
If you are in the area , it's worth a visit . I 'd rated a 4* restaurant .",Date of visit: July 2016,Studio 80,4,"Bucharest, Romania"
A good restaurant,"Being located in a rather expensive neibourghood , Garlic pub is a rather cheap restaurant . The food is tasty and you can enjoy a large types of food : from pizza , pasta t to sea food , and all sorts of meats . And the prices are resonable . It' s kids friendly and has a nice garden . I surely recomend it .",Date of visit: June 2016,Green Garlic,4,"Bucharest, Romania"
Potamo beach restaurant,A very good restaurant . The snails are very tasty . The fish is fresh from the sea . The service excellent . Ask for Vanghelis .,Date of experience: May 2016,Potamos Beach,4,"Halki, Greece"
"The ""mother and father"" of restaurants","This is one hell of a restaurant !
Excellent , to say the least !
But ......don't order fish for 2 platter , unless you are starved .
It's a fish for 4 in fact . The fish soup is also great . And the prices are more than decent . The service
also great ! I give them 10stars if that would be possible .",Date of visit: May 2016,Remezzo,4,"Crete, Greece"
"Affinia , THE hotel","We had the chance to stay again in an Affinia hotel ; the first time was a couple of years ago , in Chicago .
At that time we picked Affinia , by chance , because it was very well located , at a good price .""It was the beggining of a wonderful friendship"" :)) The 50NYC hotel is nothing less ; the staff was friendly and helpful and they were extremely kind to upgrade our room with a room with a balcony The 5 to 6 wine testing was a welcomed break in the afternoon . The room was very clean . The porters were very kind and helpful .",Date of stay: March 2016,Fifty Hotel & Suites by Affinia,4,"New York City, New York"
Best kept secret of Miami,"If you long for an honest home-made like food , while on holiday, Down stairs market and eatery is the the place. Situated on 36th street , near Panam Academy , and the airport this eatery serve Fish , soups , and all sorts of goodies . The oxtail stew is a must ! Also the lamb chops stew is delicious . Keep in mind , is nothing fancy ; is the place where local workers and sometimes a few corporates can have breakfast , lunch and dinner .
For 15$ you can have a full menu (consisting of soup , main course and a beer ) And everything it's delicious ! What it lacks in appearence , compensate with the taste of food . The personel is very kind and efficient ; although at lunch time it might form some line , it doesn't take more than 10minutes to be served . So if you are sick and tired of famous restaurants serving crap for a lot of money , this is the place . It happened to me both in Miami and New York . But about that , in the next review .",Date of stay: March 2016,Ramada by Wyndham Miami Springs/Miami International Airport,4,"Miami, Florida"
Best kept secret in Miami,"Guys , I trust your reviews but when it comes to Miami , you missed something : right at about 500m from sleep in hotel on 36th street , there is an eatery which deserves an evaluation and at least 4 star in the hall of fame .When on holiday you long for a home made like food at very affordable prices , this is the place . It's called DOWN STAIRS and it's a kind of neibourghood eatery/Market . They serve all sorts of goodies : oxtail stew is a must , but lamb stew is also delicious . For 15$ you can have a 2 course meal and a beer .
It's nothing fancy , but what it lacks in appearence , compensate in taste and price . It's that kind of restaurant where locals are eating .And sometimes some lost corporates who heard about it . And although at lunch time can be rather crowded , they are very efficient : you'll never stand in line more than 10 minutes. And be advised : they don't have the same menu every day . If you want to taste the oxtail stew you should ask in advance . The fish is also very well cooked . The soups are very tasty So if you feel like eating an honest tasty meal , forget about fancy restaurants where they charge you a lot for soffisticated crap food , and go to DOWNSTAIRS eatery . You'll never regret it.",Date of stay: March 2016,Sleep Inn at Miami International Airport,4,"Miami Springs, Florida"
A wonderful bedouin camp,"Very nice and clean bedouin camp ; you can choose from a tradi»õional tent or a luxury bedouin kind of house . The tents are basic but comfortable ,the only problem is the bathroom wich is outside in a very clean and well equiped building .But that's the bedouin way of life , after all .
The staff is very friendly and helpful .The food was great ! You have a pool and other ways of spending some relaxing time there , including a hot air balloon you can hire , to see the fascinating red desert .Unfortunately we were there in low season and there were few other tourists , but that was not that bad after all :)) The bussiness had been affected by the terorist threat too and this might be a reason for so few tourists , too .Anyway , We'll recomend it and go there again .",Date of stay: April 2015,Bait Ali,4,"Wadi Rum, Jordan"
