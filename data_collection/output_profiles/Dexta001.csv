Great stay,"We have just got back from a weeks holiday and had a lovely relaxing week, the hotel staff were very helpful the food was great for breakfast and lunch but the evening meals could have better choice

Awful meal,"We went for meal as a family Tuesday night we waited along for our food even after other people arrived after us and got there food before it was very noisy the chairs scrape along the tiled floor
The food came out on a steaming very hot skillet still cooking so by the time it cooled down the onions etc underneath were burnt black and the meat was very chewy",Date of visit: August 2015,Aberdeen Steakhouse,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Great trip,"We had a lovely trip out on the catamaran the captain and sailor were very friendly and helpful and told us about the island
