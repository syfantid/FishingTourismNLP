Not 5* but clean and good staff,"Good: clean, whole hotel and rooms very clean. Staff work hard and all wear face masks. White wine nice. Mini bar stocked up every day. Temperature taken when you arrive and whenever you enter restaurant. Food at outside venues and bookable Asian excellent.
Bad: the bed is SO hard i couldnt sleep but they gave me 2 matress toppers. Rooms more like 3*, need renovating, stains on carpet, wires hanging out, stained bath. Sunbeds, a nightmare, queue for 1.5 hrs before they open at 10am, then massive race to get one, we didnt bother and went to Ronda bar with comfy sunbeds and parasol for €10. Overcrowded hotel and noone wearing masks. Buffet food not very good and luke warm. No private beach.
We wouldnt return.",Date of stay: October 2020,Mitsis Grand Hotel Beach Hotel,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Absolutely loved it!,"Proper fishing boat, max 10 people, fishing in 2 different places, snorkelling by the caves. Amazing BBQ cooked on the boat with greek salad served in shells and big bunch of grapes. Wine, beer and water provided. Lovely couple do the trip, so friendly and nice. Would highly recommend.",Date of experience: October 2020,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great find,"Called in on way to see bon jovi concert. What a great place. Had fillet steak with horseradish mash and beetroot on specials and steak and ale pie with chips and peas. The steak was fantastic and plenty of hirseraddish in the mash, the pie was full of succlent steak. The owner straight away sorted our wobbly table out and was very friendly. Definately recommend this place. Lovely vibe too.",Date of visit: June 2019,The Millpool,1,"Coventry, United Kingdom"
"Second visit in 6 months, I love this hotel!","Great staff, Great food, Great location, Great rooms, Great entertainment, Great drinks, Great Coffee Shops, Great Cocktail bar, Just everything is Great! I asked to change room because I'd been before and had a pool view, we were moved the next day without a fuss to a view looking at the mountains and towards Kemer town which was lovely. There have been a number of updates and improvements since I went last, with the addition of a cocktail bar - which needs better signage and promotion, we didn't know it was there until day 3! The cocktails were lovely and the view at sunset over the pier was beautiful. They have replaced lots of wood on the pier and it looks lovely and have added some 2 person private covered pods overlooking the beach, the usual problem of people going early and allocating them by leaving towels, which needs changing, last time I went if your towel was left too long it was removed, that needs to be brought in again. Everyone is friendly, from the person giving out towels to the bar/restaurant staff, everyone. Reception is very helpful especially Katerina who helped me with a particular problem receiving new glasses from the optician. I would also like to say thank you to Sami Yasar, al la Carte chef. They have special nights where you can pay an extra 10 dollars/euro for a seafood night, italian or Arabian night. I did the Arabian court last time but this time it was at first cancelled due to the weather and the second time cancelled because of not enough people, BUT we were not informed, so turned up all hungry dressed up and ready and then had to ask 4 people what was going on. I also rang reception and spoke to 3 different people asking if the Arabian Court was on but they all said they didn't understand what I was asking, so gave up!! Those dining options were not advertised at all well, last year they were, this year, people I spoke to knew nothing about it and believe me it is definitely worth doing, I won't spoil the surprise for the Arabian Court just a shame it didnt happen this time. These are just little niggles, we plan on going again next year with friends. The hotel is also so clean and staff are always sweeping up, its just a Great Place! I should be paid for this review!!!",Date of stay: May 2019,DoubleTree by Hilton Antalya-Kemer,1,"Kemer, Turkey"
"Lovely country pub, great food","Now our local when staying at Longbeach camping in the forest site. Beautiful pub, superb food, the roast is fantastic. Dogs welcome in the bar area. Lovely cosy and happy atmosphere. Staff all lovely. Highly recommend. Food only served until 5.30 sundays. Recommend booking.",Date of visit: May 2019,The Green Dragon,1,"Brook, United Kingdom"
Lovely new venue and great steak,"Loving their new place, close to the premier inn. Recommend booking, luckily we did. Had scallops to start and chicken livers with peri peri sauce, both really nice. Had the fillets steaks, yum, cooked just right and juicy and tasty. Really liked the salad bar too. The pudding i thought was expensive for what it was, a sundae, £7.50, small and mostly cream. However this is my favourite eatery in Bournemouth. Plenty of staff, quick to serve and friendly.",Date of visit: January 2019,Funki Griller,1,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom"
Lovely and cosy,"Had read the reviews and decided to visit. A lovely atmosphere, food lovely, staff very friendly. The do 2 sittings 7.30 and 9. Highly recommend.",Date of visit: January 2019,Lolas Restaurant,1,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom"
90th birthday meal,"Best indian i have had for a very long time. The chicken was moist, paneer had a chilli twist. Fresh, hot, tasty and plentiful. Even my Dad was treated to an ice cream with a birthday candle and complimentary drinks. Definately my new favourite.",Date of visit: January 2019,Gurkha Sunkoshi,1,"Didcot, United Kingdom"
Alice in Wonderland,"Wonderful hotel, lovely breakfast, great room, great location, lovely spa with amazing outdoor hotub. But staff, by far are the top selling point, so friendly, happy and helpful. A massive thankyou to Alice who should have a pay rise! what a credit to the hotel. Couldnt recommend this hotel highly enough..",Date of stay: November 2018,Midgardur by Center Hotels,1,"Reykjavik, Iceland"
Nice but not all nice and Manager grumpy,"All had sunday roast. Potatoes hard, yorkshires fatty at bottom and hard on top, parsnips chewy. However, beef, turkey and veg really lovely. Venue lovely. Manager (carving meat) very unfriendly and put us off going again",Date of visit: September 2018,Kingswell Hotel and Restaurant,1,"Didcot, United Kingdom"
Ok if you want to wait a very long time,"Been quite a few times, at first food was excellent but the quality has really gone down. Meatballs being my favourite but theb2nd and third time i had it, it was awful, watery sauce lacking the tomato flavour. Always have to wait fie half to one hour before they will even take your order so takes about 1.5- 2hrs before you get any food. Staff unprofessional. Its a shame as it started so well.",Date of visit: August 2018,The Sir Walter Tyrrell,1,"Brook, United Kingdom"
Lunchtime visit,"My Dad had fish and chips and said its the best he's ever had he's 89! My mum and I had smaller portions of ham egg and chips; lovely ham, hot thick chips. My husband had pastrami sandwich which came with chips, again lovely. Nice and warm in pub. Very friendly. Our 4th visit. Lovely find.",Date of stay: February 2018,Fleur De Lys Inn,1,"Dorchester-on-Thames, United Kingdom"
Pleasant surprise,"Very nice hotel, was expecting premier inn standard but was much better. Got upgraded to a club room with coffee machine and sky tv, all very nice. Food good, breakfast could be better. Lovely leisure club.",Date of stay: January 2018,Village Hotel Swansea,1,"Swansea, United Kingdom"
"Universal are greedy allowing 6,000 people in!","Positives- lovely theme, thats it. Negatives-1500 too many people, 6,000 is ridiculous and greedy. Waited 4hrs for 1 ride, not much else to go on while you wait those 4hrs apart from 2 lagoons, a wave pool and 4 slides. Queued 1.5hrs in queue for volcano bay bus (only way to get in) with no fans in car park so people were fainting with the heat. If you have bought the $8 refillable cup, i hope your not thirsty until 10.30 as it dosent open til then! No lockers left and angry people waiting for one. Not enough sun umbrellas. A complete shambles of a park with bad organisation.",Date of experience: August 2017,Universal's Volcano Bay,1,"Orlando, Florida"
Good addition.,Nicely done and good split between both parks. Gets packed as most popular. Dragon that breathes fire is good as are the rides.,Date of experience: August 2017,The Wizarding World of Harry Potter,1,"Orlando, Florida"
Spa day inc lunch and treatment - not on a deal,I paid £160 which was quite expensive. Around the spa pool there were only 6 loungers but there must have been 16 people so where do you relax throught the day!. Lunch was lovely as was the restaurant area. The receptionist at the spa reception was lacking people skills. I'd booked our treatments in a room together but that didnt happen. The treatment was good. I wouldnt buy this at full price again but if you can get a deal then it would be good.,Date of experience: January 2017,Bluewater Spa,1,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom"
Great atmosphere,Fantastic atmosphere and music. Olives and feta and greek salad lovely. Mousakka nice but potatos were abit hard and it was only just warm. Unfortunately no white retsina and no metaxa. Petros and Stavros very friendly and accommodating. Would recommend.,Date of visit: September 2016,Zorbas Greek Restaurant,1,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom"
Excellent steak,We visited on thursday evening. Had 2 fillets and bottle of wine for £40. Steak was best i've had at a restaurant in years. First visit and will definately return. Only slight criticism we ordered 2 peppercorn sauces and they came to £10 ! They were nice but very overpriced and very strong. I suggest sharing.,Date of visit: September 2016,Funki Griller,1,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom"
Long Marston track full of pot holes,Have been to Long Marston before but this saturday the track now has so many huge pot holes that they have had to put cones along the only long strip which prevents you really experiencing the potential and experience of these great cars. You cant get the speed rhat previously you could. Such a shame and the 4 of us felt disappointed. The instructors were not happy with the situation either. Do not go to Long Marston.,Date of experience: May 2016,Everyman Racing,1,"Hoton, United Kingdom"
ok,Staff not very attentive. Food ok. Venue in need of improvement and refreshing. Good value though. House wine not too expensive.,Date of visit: September 2014,The Pabna,1,"Leek, United Kingdom"
Grand canyon and hoover dam,"The whole day was ruined by the jeep tour driver who told us at pick up time he wanted to be back to take his son to a little league match, so even tho only 4 of us on the trip he changed the pick up time to 6.30!. Due to the the jeep having an inspection at the grand canyon he couldnt accompany us on the tour but told us he'd try to meet us at the third stop (wasnt allowed off at the first stop) and we had to be back on the bus at 12.30 for lunch in the jeep. As we were walking down an area to view the canyon we met the driver who told us not to go down there but go the other side to view, where he allowed us about 2 minutes to take a photo before being rushed on the coach saying the other couple should be on it, but they werent (he was constantly ringing them on their mobile). We had to wait half an hour on the bus for them so didnt need to be rushed. At the hoover dam (a great tour) we were told we were to be away by 4.30. I was conscious of the time and we didnt get time to look in the exhibition. As we walked up to the souvenir shop the driver was there looking and TAPPING his watch and said i didnt have time for the shop, by which time id had enuf and told him as the other couple were still on the dam bridge that i was going in the shop! When the other couple came back they agreed that the trip had been ruined by his constant pressure of timing and his attitude. We were held up both ways on the new road which is being built up to the Canyon which wasnt our fault and allowances should be made. Hence the tour driver didnt get a good tip from us or the other couple. Wot a shame. These trips are memorable only if you have a good and happy tour jeep driver and he wasnt. Another point, when we were stopped because of the road works on the grand canyon road the other couple asked if they could get out to smoke. Other cars were doing that but the reply was 'no'. Not 'im sorry but.... just a plain rude 'no'. I have always loved Americans for their politeness and happiness but he was an exception to the rule. Unfortunately i cant remember his name.",,Pink Jeep Tours Las Vegas,1,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
Yum,"Just wot we needed after a long flight, secret pizza on our balcony watching the stip! My husband had read about its location before we arrived so knew where to go!",,Secret Pizza,1,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
Hidden gem,"We'd read a review about the peppermill and werent dissappointed. Old style american diner with half moon shaped booths, lovely lighting, great food, had steak twice, best i've had. Portions are big. Staff friendly. Went in lounge after and sat staring at the fire in the water, was just lovely. Cocktails lovely. If i had seen the place in day without knowing the review i probably wouldnt have gone in, but dont let the daytime exterior put you off. Its our favourite.",,Peppermill's Fireside Lounge,1,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
