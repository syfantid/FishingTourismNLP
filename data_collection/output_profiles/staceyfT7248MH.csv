The best day of our holiday,"Honestly this fishing trip is one not to be missed. Both guys on the boat were fantastic with my two children teaching them how to fish. The food was so fresh and a great end to the day. We also went snorkelling, jumping off the boat was a first for my little ones (8 & 10 years old) we made memories we will never forget. Thank you!",Date of experience: July 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Good starter to the holiday,This place was a great starter to the holiday. Food was good and beer was standard. I have to say after the 2nd day I did realise that places pulling you in are not the best and did find some much nicer places of the beaten track.,Date of visit: July 2018,Archipelagos Restaurant-Bar,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Average but worth a visit,"I would say this is a great visit for families with young kids, lots going on all around for kids.
The Titanic exhibition was very minimal not much actual exhibits from the Titanic and although it is trying to make you move away from the films it actually had more from the films to see there.
The staff are lovely and I most defiantly think you should go.",Date of experience: August 2018,National Maritime Museum Cornwall,4,"Falmouth, United Kingdom"
A pleasant trip with free wifi,"The cider is amazing!
One thing I wish restaurant staff would not do is interrupt our meal to ask if everything is ok? Surley a restaurant should be confident in their food to know it is fine and if there were a problem the customer would say. This of course is just my preference to not be interrupted whilst putting things in my mouth.
The food however is great and I would definitely visit again.",Date of visit: August 2018,The Courtyard,4,"Looe, United Kingdom"
