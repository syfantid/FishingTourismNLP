Wonderful day that makes you 10 years younger,"We can't recommend a day out with Efi and Dimitrios highly enough.
We helped bring in the catch of parrot fish, crayfish, barracuda, mullet and cuttlefish fish before sea swimming at remote bays and covering ourselves in clay from a natural spring to get 10 years younger!!
The huge lunch of freshly cooked fish, wonderful salads and ice cold beer soon puts the years back on again before heading home after a truly memorable day which the boys declared as the best of the holiday.
Thank you both so much Efi and Dimitrios x",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
