Fab hotel,"We stayed from 25th September for 9 nights and we had a fantastic holiday from beginning to end. The hotel is in a very good location for the old town, its about a 10 minute walk and the beach is also a stones throw away. The hotel is modern and spotlessly clean, we had a spacious suite on the 5th floor with a sea view that was lovely to wake up to every morning. The pool is small but was fine as we tended to go to the beach most days. The staff really are lovely, so friendly and accomodating.we stayed half board as it was so cheap, and ate out several times. The hotel restaurant is waiter service due to the covid19, and there's just one choice of main course but Savvas the restaurant manager always offered to make us something special if we didn't like what was on the menu. The food was good and all the restaurant staff were very friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",Date of stay: October 2020,Semiramis City Hotel,4,"Rhodes, Greece"

awesome !!,"We've just returned from an 11 night holiday and could not fault this hotel - it is everything you could want from a hotel and more besides. We were in the annexe in a room with a side sea view - the room was cleaned daily and was perfectly adequate for our needs with a fridge and kettle provided. The rooms are modern and bright.
The hotel setting is fabulous - it's right next to the sea and there are lots of shops , bars and restaurants on the doorstep. We used to swim in the sea rather than the pool by walking carefully over the rocks next to the hotel which is a little tricky as they are quite slippy but we found the sea to be much more refreshing than the pool which due to the extremely hot temperatures was like a warm bath . Some guests were also snorkelling in the sea by the hotel.
The staff are really friendly and helpful. The food was the best I've ever had in a hotel , really fresh with plenty of choice and the dining room was never too busy as it can be in some hotels .
My husband used to get up early and watch the beautiful sunrises .
The only negative thing I would say which is no fault of the hotel is the people who would get up at the crack of dawn to put their towels on the sunbeds. There were some who would reserve a block of sunbeds - obviously bagging them for their friends and family as well- and by 730am there would be none left . On our last day we were waiting for our airport transfer at 530am and witnessed several guests rushing out to lay claim to the ' best ' sunbeds in the prime spot on the front row next to the sea.
We were asked at the beginning of our holiday for our room number by the lifeguard , so the hotel are obviously doing some checks to make sure people from outside are not taking up the sunbeds - but I feel they need to do more as many people were complaining that they could not find a sunbed after 8am.
However all in all we had a fantastic time and will definately return in the future.",Date of stay: July 2017,Hotel Atolon,4,"Majorca, Spain"
fab hotel,"we stayed for one night and wish we'd booked for another, perfect location, lovely spacious room and very friendly staff, the meal in the restaurant was also very good as was the breakfast. I could not fault the hotel , and will definately try to return in the future .",Date of stay: June 2016,Irton Hall B&B,4,"Eskdale, United Kingdom"
'perfect',"Having just returned from 2 weeks at the Thb Sur Mallorca we found it absolutely fantastic in every way. We had read a few negative reviews before we left , however all I can say is that the people who wrote them must be nit pickers and please don't take any notice of the negative comments. The hotel is in a stunning location , with wonderful views . The resort of Colonia Sant Jordi is very nice . We thought it would be very quiet and hired a car for a week which we didn't really need and was a waste of money .
The staff at the hotel were very friendly and hard working , they were always courteous and pleasant. Some reviews said that there were long waits at the bar as there is only one member of staff serving and that all inclusive clients tend to get ignored. We certainly didn't find this to be the case. Its true that there is usually only one member of staff behind the bar but the longest we had to wait was 5 minutes and as you're on holiday - whats the rush ?
We went all inclusive - the food was lovely and there was always plenty of choice . We were spoilt for choice in fact. Every night there is a different theme eg. Spanish, Italian, Mexican, American etc. Some reviews also stated the food was geared towards the Germans but this definitely wasn't the case. The breakfasts were plentiful and there was lots of different food on offer from full English to continental. Vegetarians were also well catered for .
It was also nice to be able to have our breakfast and lunch on the outdoor terrace where the chef grills your choice of fish or meat to order.
The rooms were very clean and modern , they were cleaned and towels changed every day. There was a fridge in the room which usually incurs an extra charge at other hotels we have stayed in but didn't cost any extra here. The maids were also really friendly . Our room was on the 9th floor and the view was out of this world.
The sunsets at night were fabulous .
Its just a few steps from the hotel to the sea , and there were always people were swimming and snorkelling off the steps into the sea.
All in all we had the best holiday ever and will definitely try to return next year for some more !!",Date of stay: July 2014,THB Sur Mallorca,4,"Majorca, Spain"
