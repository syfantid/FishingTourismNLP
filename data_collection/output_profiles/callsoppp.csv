Animal Welfare Concerns.,"Today I visited the farm park and to say the least, was extremely disappointed and disgusted in all honesty. I went with high expectations with it having good reviews and being a popular farm. However after going round the farm, it was very clear to see none of the animals had been cleaned out for a long time. Every single field was full of poo which can be very dangerous in warm weather and the ducks water tray was full of poo that it was drinking out of. As we were walking towards the horse field, a horse had kicked over the gate which was not attached to anything. We had to move it back and prop it up to stop the horses getting out. I tried to find someone to explain what had happened but could not find any staff. Considering this is a farm and have a duty of care under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 meaning they must provide animals with a suitable environment, and a suitable diet including access to fresh clean water they are not doing this. It seems like the farm is more interested in hosting activities and getting people through the door than fulfilling their basic duties to care for the animals which is unacceptable.",Date of experience: May 2018,Matlock Farm Park,1,"Matlock, United Kingdom"
Rhodes Holiday,"We stayed at the Ixian Grand between 7th-13th May 2017. The hotel itself is very well presented and all the staff were extremely polite, friendly and helpful. It has a beautiful veiw of the sea from the poolside which is a few steps away from the beach (photo attatched). We stayed in a garden view room and were all inclusive which I highly recommend! The room was lovely and was tidied everyday (beds made, fresh towels) and the food was lovely. The buffet had a wide variety of food breakfast, lunch and tea which was all very tasty! I would also recommend going to the Degu7 resturant on site one evening as it is such a great fine dining experience too.

If you are looking for a hotel close to Rhodes and a stonethrow away from the beach I would highly recommend this hotel. It is about 5-10 minutes away from Rhodes old town in a taxi. It is also about a 10 minute walk from shops in Iylasos which are nice to look around too.

You don't have to checkout until 12pm on the day you leave too. If your transfers aren't until later you can leave your luggage in the luggage room (super handy) and if you are all inclusive, it lasts right up until you leave the hotel.

Really lovely place and wonderful experience. Definitely recommend.",Date of stay: May 2017,The Ixian Grand,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Farm Visit,"We visited the farm whilst on holiday earlier this month (May 2017). The farm is such a different experience, in a good way! Such a good opportunity to come up close with ostriches as well as other animals such as llamas, a camel, ponies, donkeys, goats and more! All the animals are very friendly and are polite when you are hand feeding them.
It's such a good experience hand feeding the ostriches too. The staff at the farm are all very friendly and clearly care for all the animals.
If you are visiting Rhodes, no matter your age or anything I would recommend a visit here for a couple of hours, it's very good fun.",Date of experience: May 2017,Farma of Rhodes Petting Zoo,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Palace of Grand Master of Knights,"We visited in early May 2017 whilst on holiday in Rhodes. If you are looking for a bit of culture whilst in Rhodes old town then I would recommend a visit! There are a few different exhibitions to look around. If Greek history is something that interests you then you will enjoy the visit.
Worth a visit if you are looking for something a bit different to shops and restaurants whilst in the old town!",Date of experience: May 2017,Palace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Rhodes Fishing Trip,"Cannot recommend this boat trip enough! It was one of the definite highlights of our holiday. Boat trip, fishing, snorkelling and great food! We had opportunities to see and take photos of Rhodes before going out to start fishing. The guys on the boat were fantastic, showed all the fishing newbies the ropes (including myself!) and we caught loads of fish. We spent 2.5 hours fishing but it just flew by. It was so much fun. We then went closer in to shore and had the opportunity to snorkel if we wanted. They were more than happy to provide floats if you weren't sure about being in the sea too. The captain then barbecued fish for us and the food was amazing (photo attached). Overall it was such a fantastic experience and worth every penny. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to do a boat trip in Rhodes!",Date of experience: May 2017,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
