The best day!!!,"So today has been the most incredible day with Antonia and the rest of the crew! We were collected from our hotel and brought down to the harbour and taken onto the boat by Antonia for homemade cake and coffee. We literally have had the most amazing time being taken out to place the nets for the next 2 days catch.. then to go and collect the nets set beforehand for our lunch! We waited in anticipation for the catch to be pulled in and couldnâ€™t have been more excited to see lobsters and spider crabs come aboard!! While we were taken to a gorgeous bay To swim and relax in the beautiful settings, antonia prepared the the most incredible lunch. Freshly prepared bruschetta on the tastiest bread to start, and then to be served with the most amazing seafood spread with spaghetti , potatoes and salad!! Water was crystal clear, fish and lobster was so fresh and tasty And i genuinely cannot recommend this trip enough!! Antonia, her husband and the amazing fisherman who brought in the catch were all a pleasure to meet and spend the day with! If youre unsure whether to book- do it!! :D",Date of experience: July 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic day out - Andrew is brilliant & the experience was incredible!,"We had such an amazing day kayaking!
We whatsapp'ed Andrew first to check which day was best for the weather - he picked the day after we initially suggested and he couldn't have been more right! It was stunning, the water was calm and we found him no problem.
We had a quick brief, all the info on where to go and what to do when we got to each point what to look out for and off we went! We got a life jacket and a 20L dry bag which was DEFINITELY needed!
We kayaked to and explored St Pauls Island, the caves nearby which we actually kayaked into, and found a stunning little private cove where we stopped to sunbathe.
Recommend highly! Andrew we will be back our friend! Such a top bloke!",Date of experience: April 2016,Bugibba Kayak Hire,5,"Island of Malta, Malta"
Stunning location. Fantastic Hotel. Wonderful Staff. 5* - would 100% return!,"We have just returned from a week at the beautiful db Seabank.
If you're unsure of booking this hotel - DONT BE! It is gorgeous, you walk in and the reception area is stunning... Open, clear, light and so clean!
The rooms are so lovely, navy blue and white themed they fit so well with the sea views and they are really light & airy, there are fans in every room so we didn't even use the AC. Usual bits like a safe and fridge were standard items but we also asked for an iron which came within half an hour - board and all!
A few things to mention : RECEPTION STAFF - They are SO helpful. I have to mention 2 in particular.
Marianne - She checked us in to our sea view room but it didn't have a full view, so I requested to change to a more central location and not only did she arrange this immediately, she called us an hour or 2 later to check our room was ok and spoke to my partner who thanked her, and when she saw me in reception later that day she made a point of asking if everything was to our standard and was so, so lovely to speak to. She at several points personally addressed me throughout the holiday in the reception area, helped with any requests or questions and was so polite, friendly and lovely to speak to, it was a pleasure to deal with her and I actually found her to say goodbye before I left!
Karen - She literally saved the end of our holiday being even more of a disaster than it was. Our airline had changed our flight to 12hours earlier than scheduled and booking company didn't inform us, so when we found this out and were stranded in malta, she did absolutely everything she could do fix this for us and find out how else we could get home. She put up with my tears, 2 clearly very stressed guests and made us feel so much calmer by helping us speak to airlines and airport staff in Malta. I cannot thank you her enough - she didn't have to do any of that and she did everything she could and more. Totally going over and above for your guests is exactly what this hotel does!
FOOD:
The food at this hotel is AMAZING. We ate SO much. Every meal there was something delicious! One day we were stuck between swordfish, lamb leg, pork and thick beef steak. The food is ample and so tasty. Breakfast is the one! SO MUCH CHOICE and we literally had full English with omelettes made to order and everything else you might want too. Anyone who says all inclusive is rubbish buffet food hasn't been here! (Although the Italian wasn't what we expected to be honest!) Otherwise the Brazilian is like Bem Brazil - we couldn't eat all 4 courses haha... and the Jungle restaurant was full so didn't get chance to eat there - Book in advance even If its a few days before as this hotel is so popular its worth getting to try each restaurant! :)
DRINK: JEEPERS. You certainly don't get cheap cocktails here. They're tasty, strong, and any way you like them! Carlsberg on tap, wine on tap, everything is a good standard, I wasn't ill once from the alcohol (and I mean by that it wasnt cheap crap that gives you a headache and makes you feel sick from all the sugar haha). I have to make a special mention again to another of the wonderful staff Alina, she is a fantastic barmaid, friendly, chatty and absolutely lovely to get to know. She chatted to us every day and again she was someone I seeked out to say goodbye to when we left because of her genuine loveliness.
All in all this is an amazing hotel. Direct links to buses right outside to explore other towns, beautiful landscapes, friendly staff, fantastic food and drink... what more can you want! Oh yea - Free Wifi you get that too!
TIPS:
If you like sun on your balcony, go for a pool rather than sea view, as the sea view is North Facing we missed out on the sunshine coming east to west!
Go to the spa! Its gorgeous, we had a couples massage and it was worth every penny and more!
Go bowling - Its great fun, its in the hotel, 5EURO per person per game is totally worth it for an hours fun of an evening!
We were told the minister of tourism or something like that owns the hotel so its the benchmark of standards in Malta meaning its bloody brilliant haha. Definitely would recommend!!",Date of stay: March 2016,db Seabank Resort + Spa,5,"Island of Malta, Malta"
