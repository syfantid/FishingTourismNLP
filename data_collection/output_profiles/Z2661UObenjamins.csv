Fresh fish and unbelievable hospitality,"We were in Santorini for our honeymoon and this was one of the things we were most looking forward to. It didn't disappoint. Anthi and her crew were spectacular. She arranged pick up and drop off from the hotel, but was also able to accommodate it to picking us up from the Akrotiri museum since we were there instead. The boat is comfortable, clean and safe. It is a working fishing boat. It is not a luxury yacht with polo wearing first mates, but those are a dime a dozen and a different experience if that is what you are looking for.

Got to take a swim in the sea while the crew was cooking up the first part of dinner of what was caught in the traps and nets. The fishing is fun and what we caught/cooked was great. Being from New England we know good seafood, but have never experienced the short order of ocean-->grill-->plate seafood like this. Certainly no one went hungry! Anthi and the crew told us which fish were dangerous to touch (spines, teeth, stingers, etc), which were good for eating, which to throw back. They'll help you bait the hand reels and unhook anything you catch if you are concerned doing it yourself.

We did the sunset cruise. That alone is worth the ride out on the boat. Not to mention that there are snacks and drinks (beer, wine, water, soda) the whole trip as well. It was an amazing experience. Anthi truly cares about the culture of the island and wants her guests to have a safe, great and memorable time. She individually got to know us and make sure we each got what were looking for out of the experience. She might be the sweetest person we met on our entire honeymoon.",Date of experience: August 2018,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Post Wedding Late night,"These guys were great. Rented out ""The Jake"" which is their event space for a post-wedding reception late night. We were able to drop off some decorations and a phone for playing music which they set up for us before we got there. They had plenty of bartenders, a great sound system and a really nice atmosphere to have the party keep going. They were more than accommodating. Would highly recommend for a group outing, late night, party venue. Also had a nice dinner here during the planning stages. Have had drinks here numerous times as well",Date of visit: August 2018,Ladder 133 Kitchen & Social,4,"Providence, Rhode Island"
4 day stay during our honeymoon,"An absolute gem. The family that runs the hotel are super nice and very accommodating. The location is perfect for a few days on the island. It's a 3 minute walk to a grocery store and the hustle/bustle of the town of Fira but not in the heart of it where catching shuttle buses or transfers is chaos. Fira is also where the bus depot is located so from the hotel there is easy access to the whole island.

At check in we were treated to some Santorini wine. The front desk staff are nice, speak excellent English and will arrange whatever you may need. They are truly hospitable. Our room was clean, well arranged and more than enough space to spread out. We were adjacent to the pool which is very nice and comfortable with poolside chairs. The breakfast was included in our room rate and was just what we needed to get some fuel and caffeine in the tank before starting our days.
We would highly recommend this hotel, particularly if you aren't keen on paying $500/per night just to have an infinity pool.",Date of stay: August 2018,Astir Thira Hotel,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Well worth a visit,Climb out of your infinity pool in Fira and check this place out. Very cool site of an early civilization on the island that dates back to Minoan civilization on the neighboring island of Crete. It's considered the Greek Pompeii by many. We did a guided tour with Notos tour and that was great. Our guide spoke English and Spanish and curated the site for us with pictures and explanations. It has a large roof overhead so is a decent way to stay out of the son. Very cool to imagine what their civilization was like. Unfortunately it is not actively being excavated due to budget constraints in Greece.,Date of experience: August 2018,Akrotiri Archaeological Site,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Lovely day on the water for some real sailing,"We did a sailing tour of Naxos and one of the small Cyclades for a day trip on our honeymoon. It was a great experience. George had the day off but his son was our guide for the day.
The boat is comfortable and true working sailboat. We read other reviews about sailing trips that never even attempt to sail but these guys were all about it. The seas can be a bit frightening on the way out of port but the crew let the landlovers know that this was normal. We sailed to Rina cave and swam around with gear provided by the crew. We then sailed to a small island for a hike into town, lunch and another swim on a relatively low traffic beach. The sail back was great and we did some tacking into the wind before zooming into port.
Some drinks and snacks were provided throughout which was nice. One of the crew was taking pictures the whole time and we came back later that evening to pick up a disc loaded with images of our group from the day. George found out it was our honeymoon and hooked us up with some hats! We also used the next few days on the island to explore places we had seen from the boat.",Date of experience: August 2018,Naxos Sailing,4,"Naxos, Greece"
Great intro to Athens,"We did the afternoon walking tour the day we arrived and Athens. It was a great intro to current Greek society/history but also a deep dive into the ancient city. We walked past some of the major government buildings, as well as Hadrian's arch and Zeus's temple before diving into the Plaka region around the Acropolis. The small paths and alleys are so interesting and so picturesque. We got up to Mar's hill and one of the adjacent hills for our picnic dinner and some wine. Very nice experience, tons of useful info that set us up for the rest of our time in Athens, lots of great photos too. Would highly recommend. We went to tip our lovely and informative guide at the end and she refused to take it! Thanks again!",Date of experience: August 2018,Hidden Athens Small Group Walking Tour and Picnic: Plaka and the Hills of Athens,4,"Athens, Greece"
