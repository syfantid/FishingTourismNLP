A Truly Fantastic Day at Sea!!!,"We experienced this fantastic boat trip with Zante Fishing Tours whilst on holiday in Kalamaki. We have holidayed here for many years and were looking for something different. This trip provided this and lots lots more!

From being involved in casting the nets, watching the catch come in and swimming in some truly beautiful places, all topped off with a wonderful lunch which included the fish we had caught fresh from the sea!

Giorgos and his “FBI” in-laws were such marvellous hosts, and provided great insight into fishing techniques and of the island. They ensured we sailed the waters in such a way to prevent a rough ride and therefore no chance of sea sickness, which we were all slightly worried about. Life jackets, snorkels and flotation aids were all provided to help those less confident in the water.

The swimming stop offs were in areas which were isolated and off the beaten track, making the experience all the more special.

We were a party of 10 and everyone enthused about the trip. In fact once telling others about it back at our hotel, many swiftly booked in the following days.

This was truly the highlight of our holiday and will definitely return to do it again next year!

Thanks to Captain Giorgos and the family, from Dave, Natasha and friends!",Date of experience: July 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
