A bit of Paris in London.,Great atmosphere. Service and food excellent. A real treat at modest price. The wines are not too expensive and s good selection of digestives.,Date of visit: February 2020,Pierre Victoire,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Handy Italian,"I only had the seafood linguine. It was delicious plenty of fresh seafood in a tasty pasta sauce. The service was good and the food served hot, which is important. The price ok for immediate borders of Monaco.",Date of visit: September 2019,Cafe&Kitchen Il Calcio,1,"Monte-Carlo, Monaco"
Great traditional cooking,"I’m surprised at the number of negative reviews! The location is great and the food we ordered was really good. It’s a traditional restaurant not a touristy place, most Portuguese people at lunchtime. The centre piece is an old water fountain in working order. Locals still use the fresh water as it’s a public amenity. I had a prawn omelette and salad and fries which was delicious. It was fresh, hot and filled with tasty prawns. At €13.50 a little on the expensive side but service was good and attentive. The pudim or creme caramel was served in a portion large really enough for 3 to share and again was fresh and delicious. Expresso coffee was very hot and perfect with a smooth Maciera brandy. To enjoy this place It probably helps to speak Portuguese.",Date of visit: January 2019,Almirante,1,"Madeira, Portugal"
What a fantastic view,We took a yellow bus tour which was great and very reasonably priced at €18 for 48 hours with 3 possible routes. Part of our trip included a mini bus circuit to Cabo Giral. The views from the glass bridge and beyond we stunning. You can also relax over a beer or coffee taking in the very fresh air. The glass bridge isn’t for everyone especially with s fear of heights but is perfectly safe.,Date of experience: January 2019,Cabo Girao,1,"Madeira, Portugal"
Spectacular views and layout,"A great range of plants from around the World. Lovely terraces with stunning views. Buses 29, 31 and 31A stop directly outside. Entrance €6 for adults very reasonable. January is probably not the best month to visit although still quite s but if colour. Plants clearly marked showing genus and global regions. Sit enjoy the views and diversity of the planting. There is s trendy cafe in the gardens where you can relax.",Date of experience: January 2019,Madeira Botanical Garden,1,"Madeira, Portugal"
Ok restaurant,We chose to eat inside in the evening. The place is soulless. It could be improved by ambient lighting. The waiter seemed tired and uninterested as did most of the staff. The food was ok nothing fancy but substantial portions. Price point about right. Wines very reasonable. No doubt a better place at lunchtime when sunny in the square.,Date of visit: January 2019,La Pasta,1,"Madeira, Portugal"
Great food but,"I’ve been using Topolino’s for a number of years and have always enjoyed the food and service. Antonio is a great welcoming front of house.

On my last visit unfortunately he wasn’t there. Karen, whom I believe is the owner, was on duty. Everything seemed too much trouble for her. Her mood completely spoilt our evening. The other staff and food were great. I can only think she must have had an off day. The last thing anyone wants is a negative attitude when going out for a nice evening meal. Hopefully, it was just a one off experience.",Date of visit: December 2018,Topolino,1,"West Wickham, United Kingdom"
A gem with great views,"A great restaurant with simple well cooked food specialising in gyros and souvlaki, bbq and traditional Greek food , moussaka etc. Very reasonably priced. A gyros which is a meal in itself starts at only €2.50. For grilled meat pork of lamb, dip and chips in a pitta. So, so tasty. If you’re really hungry go for the mixed grill which could be shared amongst 3 easily. Drinks are also cheap and a good selection available.

The staff are so friendly and welcoming. Service on point and they don’t rush you!

The views are to die for. It’s a pity the place isn’t open at lunchtime. However, the cliff top location affords gentle breezes in the evening. Give this place a try and I’m sure you’ll go back again and again.",Date of visit: July 2018,Souvlaki Steak House & Grill,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great fish & chips,A great local high street fish shop. The fish is always so fresh crispy tasty batter. You can eat in or takeaway. Friendly efficient service. Discounts for OAP’s on some days. Especially busy on Fridays.,Date of visit: July 2018,The Fish House,1,"Croydon, United Kingdom"
The best fishing trip ever,"My friends Alina & Debbie booked this trip as a surprise for me. Boy, what a surprise. We arrived at the quay at 8am to very warm reception. We boarded almost immediately and were served Greek coffee and home made sponge cake, delicious.

Once all the guests, I think they have a maximum of 10 on a trip, arrived we set off to place fresh nets. Once this was done, it took about 20 minutes, we moved on to recovery the previous days nets. Once the hauling process began much to my surprise a lobster appeared! In fact on that day the majority of the catch was rock lobsters - see picture.

It took a fair amount of time to complete the hauling exercise but every minute was exciting as you didn’t know what would appear. All undersized fish and sea creatures were immediately returned to the ocean to continue to grow and preserve stocks.

Once the process was complete we headed off to a quiet bay for swimming and relaxing whilst Antonia and the crew prepared our lunch. The lunch consisted of bruschetta followed by lobster, spaghetti cooked with the pan juices of the lobster etc. Greek and potatoes salad was plentiful plus white wine, water and soft drinks.

After a good rest we could resume swimming or in my case I enjoyed a quiet nap.

We returned to the harbour at around 4 pm throughly satisfied having been entertained royally by a wonderful family. a splendid unique day out for all the family.",Date of experience: July 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Tfr in Kefalonia,Easily booked and paid for my taxi on their website. The driver was there waiting for me and clearly visible. The car was large and extremely comfortable. One suggestion is that cold bottled water should be available in the care. Sun transfers are not the cheapest in the market but offer a great service.,Date of experience: July 2018,Suntransfers,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Mediocre,Neat and tidy restaurant. Food looks as described in menu but more style over substance and flavour. No passion in the cooking. Do the chefs taste the food for seasoning or boil up a caldron and add water? We were expecting authentic flavours but sadly didn't get them. Waiting staff ok but not welcoming bland like the food and no enthusiasm.,Date of visit: November 2017,Hanoi,1,"Paris, France"
Not what it was!,"I've been visiting Chez Paul for over 20 years and have always enjoyed the food and ambience. However, on the last occasion the waiting staff were indifferent and the food my partner and I were served was lack lustre and portion size much diminished. The Onion soup was watery and the frisée aux lardon and poach egg salad minimalist. The room was stuffed with very, very loud Americans who gave no consideration to other diners. All in all a thoroughly disappointing dining experience.",Date of visit: November 2017,Chez Paul,1,"Paris, France"
Dreadful chain food,Ventured into Food Republic to try variety of cuisine. I tried the Nasi Lemak in Mdm Kwan's tasteless filet chicken not marinated with curry sauce just poured on top. Ilan billis soft and no crunch as soaked in Sambal which also had no distinctive flavour. Coconut rice also tasteless. I left 80% of the meal. Very disappointing given the hype.,Date of visit: April 2017,Madam Kwan's Pavilion,1,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"
"Food good, service hit and miss","This restaurant is on the land side of the busy main road, although it provides a tranquil environment for dinner with good decor. The food was good a mix of Thai and western. The younger staff some family members were welcoming although the lady who I assume was the mother was less welcoming and seemed tired of waiting at tables. cocktails are good and they have draft Asahi beer which was a treat.",Date of visit: November 2016,Patty's Secret Garden,1,"Ko Lanta, Thailand"
Great fusion food offering,"We really enjoyed our meal here. The Skagen was an excellent starter. I had pan fried fish filets cooked to perfection, although a little too much butter/oil for my taste. Cocktails were excellent especially the Pina Colada",Date of visit: November 2016,Cozy Restaurant And Bar,1,"Ko Lanta, Thailand"
"Good massage, but now back pain","Manee, is a wonderful and caring masseuse. She speaks good English and is highly skilled. Overall I was very satisfied with the treatment received. However, despite requesting my lower back was not touched or manipulated in anyway, it was! I am now left with a painful spasm on the right side of my spine and will have to see my osteopath on return to the UK. Providing you have no previous history of back pain you will enjoy and feel invigorated by the experience at Maneelanta.",Date of experience: November 2016,Maneelanta Massage,1,"Ko Lanta, Thailand"
Wonderful unspoilt beach.,"What a great beach. It's 4 kilometres in length and a good number of places where to eat and have drinks. Try the Tiwi Lay Thai restaurant great authentic Thai food. The sea off the beach is pristine although there are some rocks in places. The pull of the tides can be strong so small children must be accompanied at all times. You will need a beach mat and towels as deck chairs, sun beds and parasols are scarce.",Date of experience: December 2016,Long Beach,1,"Ko Lanta, Thailand"
Great quirky restaurant,The food here was some of the best on the island. A type of tapas with interesting combinations of ingredients and flavours. Cocktails are very good too. Staff attentive and really do go out of the way to make you enjoy your dining experience. Try the slow cooked beef short ribs they're so succulent and tasty. The wine is reasonably priced.,Date of visit: December 2016,Red Snapper,1,"Ko Lanta, Thailand"
"Good hotel, poor location","Overall a good clean hotel. Staff would benefit from a customer focus refresher. Better in room facilities tea/coffee making, free safety boxes and irons and ironing boards. Good for families as spotlessly clean.",Date of stay: September 2016,Catalonia Oro Negro,1,"Tenerife, Spain"
Great French bar,"By chance I came across this small venue. I ventured in a was immediately greeted with a smile and seated in the bar. My intention was just to have a glass of wine but the menu was appealing so I had one course the terrine of foie gras, salad and bread. It was spot-on. The place has a warm and friendly relaxed feel. Ideal after a hard day in the office. Staff attentive but not cloying. Pricey but well worth it.",Date of visit: March 2016,Le Carillon De L'Angelus,1,"Singapore, Singapore"
Good local food,This restaurant represents extremely good value. The food is local Czech basic and hearty. The beers are very good although small selection. Service was attentive but not intrusive.,Date of visit: November 2015,Restaurace Na Klarove,1,"Prague, Czech Republic"
Elegant Italian in Prague,Great Italian food opposite the theatre. Have a glass of wine or pro secco and enjoy a good selection of pizza and Italian antipasto for free. Main courses very good and substantial. Staff very friendly and mainly Italian,Date of visit: December 2015,IL Mulino,1,"Prague, Czech Republic"
Super location and resort.,"We booked an 8 days stay at the Meritus Pelangi beach in Pantai Cenang, Langkawi. On arrival we were greeted warmly by the staff and immediately felt at home. Check in was smooth but sadly our room was not suitable. We therefore paid for a n upper floor beach front room and the extra money was well worth it!

As others have reported in their reviews the room could do with up dating but were scrupulously clean and comfortable. the beds were very good. The buffet breakfast included everything anyone would want. My only gripe was that the coffee was never served very hot but with so many guests over the Chinese New Year period that was perhaps not surprising. The staff could not be more helpful and all worked hard, but need a little more management to improve efficiency.

The beach was lovely although you have to be careful as the shells are sharp and could cause minor cuts. The sun beds were comfortable and the shades were crafted from topiary tree rather than garish logo umbrellas. The pool towel service was also excellent.

As with most hotels check out was at 12 noon. We were advised that we could use the leisure centre for shower and change facilities which was necessary as we had an evening flight to KL. However, the facilities were very cramped and had no air conditioning, these need to be improved.

All in all a great relaxing holiday. There are many very good restaurants nearby and i would highly recommend the Orchid Ria Chinese Restaurant, the food is excellent and very reasonably priced for the quality of food on offer. A disappointing restaurant and much more expensive restaurant was The Brasserie, the setting was great but the staff disinterested and the food not of the quality one would expect from a restaurant listed as one of the best. The wine list was also serious depleted with not much choice. This place could be really excellent with better management.",Date of stay: February 2015,"Pelangi Beach Resort & Spa, Langkawi",1,"Langkawi, Malaysia"
Everything you need is here,Great choice of restaurants to suit all budgets. Plenty of beach activities for the family to enjoy.,Date of experience: February 2015,Cenang Beach,1,"Langkawi, Malaysia"
Cracking Chinese Restaurant in Pantai Cenang,"There's nothing to dislike here the food is so, so fresh and tasty, The staff efficient and friendly. The price of the fresh fish is unbelievably cheap. Despite the restaurant being full to capacity everything was served quickly and pipping hot. the deep fried Thai style snapper was delicious.",Date of visit: February 2015,Orkid Ria Seafood Restaurant,1,"Langkawi, Malaysia"
Good basic french Brasserie food.,"Chez Paul, never fails to deliver an excellent dining experience. the two rooms are quirky. We always visit Chez Paul on our first night in Paris, it sets the mood for a perfect short break. The services is attentive but not cloying. The food is perfectly cooked and present in a rustic style. The basic ingredients are excellent and they deliver on flavour. Their wine list is good and offers something for everyone at prices to suit all budgets. I thoroughly recommend this restaurant for a relaxed and enjoyable evening.",Date of visit: January 2014,Chez Paul,1,"Paris, France"
Fab Paris hotel near Gard du Nord,"We just had a lovely 2 night break at the Palm Opera hotel. It's a short walk from Gard du Nord. The rooms are on the small side but spotlessly clean. The shower was big enough for two! Breakfast was very good with a great choice of breads, hot breakfast items and Continental meats and cheeses. Free coffee, tea, cold drinks, savoury snacks and cakes are available in the lobby from 10 until 10pm a very nice touch. We'll certainly come back to this great boutique hotel again.",Date of stay: January 2014,Hotel Palm - Astotel,1,"Paris, France"
