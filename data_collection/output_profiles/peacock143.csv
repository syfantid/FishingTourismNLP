Amazing Food,"We did not stay at the hotel but visited for lunch & dinner 3 times in 1 week. What can I say...the food was the nicest we’d had on holiday, the portions were huge and such great value for money. The view of the sea at the top of the island was amazing. All the staff were very friendly and attentive but a special mention to Evgenia who had a brilliant sense of humour and looked after us so much. We will definitely be coming back to the hotel to stay in the future.",Date of stay: June 2019,Aquarium View Hotel,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Loved every minute,"This trip was brilliant. I’d never fished before but Captain Mixalis was very knowledgable and patient. The views from the boat, the swimming experience and bbq were second to none. Of all the trips you get hassled for when walking through the port this was by far the best. Ended up Facebook friends with the captain, sharing all our photos and a trip we’ll never forget.",Date of experience: June 2019,Captain Manolis Fishing Trips in Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
