Amazing,This was by far the best day of our holiday. It was a great learning experience and lots of fun. The boat was clean and beautiful and they paid attention to detail using beautiful hand made plates instead of plastic.. the fish we caught was well cooked and delicious.. all in all a fantastic day.
