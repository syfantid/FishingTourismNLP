Great Tour - Ask for Nickolas,"My wife and I spent the last days of our honeymoon in Athens, which included a guided tour of the city from Nickolas. He was kind and attentive, knowledgeable about the sites, and was happy to speak with us about Greek history as we moved from attraction to attraction. The car was exceptionally clean and the ride was comfortable, which made the tour that much more enjoyable. We'd highly recommend Exceptional Journey and Nickolas as your guide if you are able to request!",Date of experience: September 2019,Exceptional Journey DMC,4,"Athens, Greece"
Highlight of the trip,"Amazing and authentic fishing experience for me and my wife. The crew was very friendly and cooked an excellent lunch.

Anthi (the captain) was very kind and knowledgeable",Date of experience: August 2019,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
A Must-do Activity in Milos!,"If you are visiting Milos, you must reserve a tour with Oneiro. You should probably make a point to visit Milos just to do this tour. It was one of our favorite activities of a 2 week island hopping vacation in Greece. Elias, the captain, is engaging, welcoming, and knowledgeable about the area. His crew-mate, Vassilis, was also very friendly and helpful. The boat is comfortable and clean and they provide towels, snorkel gear, and have a small motor boat which they use to take you on excursions through the caves during swimming breaks. The coast of Milos is just incredible, and there are a number of places you can only reach via boat. Also, they provided food throughout the day, and the lunch in particular was great - fresh Greek salad with tomatoes Elias grew, fresh shrimp linguini, and delicious white wine that Elias’ wife’s cousin homemade. Incredible day",Date of experience: August 2019,Oneiro Milos,4,"Milos, Greece"
Authentic Greek Experience,The food is excellent with a smaller menu but extreme focus on quality. The staff was friendly and genuine. Would highly recommend,Date of visit: August 2019,Klimataria,4,"Athens, Greece"
Great location in a cute fishing village,"Medusa is located in a colorful fishing village called Mandrakia. It’s worth it to visit just to see the village, and the restaurant is located right on the water and has great views. We arrived just before sunset (maybe an hour before) and the light was perfect throughout our meal. The food was also very good. There were a number of cats around however, and while they weren’t aggressive, by any means, they did wander around your feet which could be starling at times.",Date of visit: August 2019,Medusa,4,"Milos, Greece"
Great Cheap Eats,"No frills restaurant in the middle of town. If you're looking for a quick bite of great food that is reasonably priced, this is the spot.

Gyros are excellent. We went twice in 40 hours of being in Paros",Date of visit: August 2019,Ta Kritikakia,4,"Paros, Greece"
Best Restaurant of our Trip,"Easily the best restaurant of our trip. The setting and staff were magnificent.

The restaurant puts an unique spin on traditional Greek food and has excellent house wine.

Get the pesto calamari and house red",Date of visit: August 2019,Candouni Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Fresh seafood and incredible vies,"From start to finish, Armeni Restaurant was incredible. To get there, they pick you up in a small boat in Ammoudi Bay, so you experience Ammoudi and Oia from the water as you boat around a side of the caldera and arrive at a few buildings built into the cliff walls, one of which is the restaurant. Then, the food is all high quality Greek food. We had the best Greek salad, tzatziki, octopus, and the best freshest fish that we selected before out meal (highly recommend doing this!!). All in the shade staring out into the beautiful water.",Date of visit: August 2019,Armeni Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Spacious and gorgeous,"Santo Maris’ property is very large and spread out, which we liked (most of the hotels that are right on the caldera are on top of one another and seem to have little privacy). There are multiple pools spread around the property, which are all very nice. The rooms are also clean and large. The hotel itself is about a 5 minute walk to the town on a very safe easy path. The staff is extremely friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The bar and breakfast/restaurant staff are great. We also had a “Greek massage” at the spa and the staff there was great as well.",Date of stay: August 2019,Santo Maris Oia Luxury Suites & Spa,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Close Walk To Town,"New hotel that is a close walk to town. Staff is kind and helpful, including arranging transport for us and helping to navigate the neighborhood. Rooms were a bit smaller than expected and room had an odd odor.",Date of stay: August 2019,Bohemian Luxury Boutique Hotel,4,"Paros, Greece"
Gorgeous classic hotel with excellent staff,"We stayed at the Grande Bretagne for 2 nights and could not have enjoyed the stay more. The hotel itself is beautiful- ornate decor, an impressive lobby, beautiful restaurant on the main floor, and of course the GB Roof restaurant on the roof. The staff at the hotel is supremely helpful. The attention to detail is great too. We very much enjoyed our room (very comfortable bed and spacious bathroom)",Date of stay: September 2019,"Hotel Grande Bretagne, A Luxury Collection Hotel",4,"Athens, Greece"
Great view and excellent service,The GB Roof restaurant has an unparalleled view of the acropolis - make sure to visit before the sun has set to watch sunset and the lights turning on on the top of the acropolis. The food is also very tasty and staff that works at the Grande Bretagne (restaurant and hotel itself) are all wonderful.,Date of visit: September 2019,GB Roof Garden,4,"Athens, Greece"

PHH,"Great location - easy walking distance to everything in downtown Portland. Rooms are old, but fine, however bathrooms are updated, which is nice.

Favorite,"A favorite spot of ours in Portland, and probably favorite bakery anywhere. We stop for a scone and a few pastries each time we visit Portland. Coffee/tea good as well. Everything is fresh and delicious and accompanied with a polite and helpful staff. Love love love standard baking",Date of visit: June 2019,Standard Baking Co.,4,"Portland, Maine"
Fore Street,"Food was great - tasty, and good portions. Love that everything is fresh with a new menu each day. Tasted that fresh as well. Layout and design was average and room becomes dark later into evening. Would recommend trying to get a reservation - they didn’t used to take them but seems like they’ve started.",Date of visit: June 2019,Fore Street Restaurant,4,"Portland, Maine"

Peaks Island,"The Inn on Peaks is such a wonderful place to stay. Peaks Island itself is gorgeous, and the Inn is perfectly and conveniently located within walking distance of the ferry dock, a few food, coffee, ice cream shops, the golf carts etc. The rooms themselves are cute and comfortable as well as spacious; the Great Diamond room in particular is superb. Also, the staff is very friendly and the food served at the Inn restaurant is great.",Date of stay: June 2019,The Inn on Peaks Island,4,"Peaks Island, Maine"
