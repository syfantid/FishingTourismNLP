Absolutely amazing roast dinner,"We stayed at an air bnb near to this restaurant and it was recommended to us. As my daughter is a student at the university here, she really fancied roast dinner.

She had the roast lamb and I had the roast beef (cooked pink, thank heavens). Absolutely delicious and really generous portions. The biggest Yorkshire puddings and the crunchiest roast potatoes, flavoursome parsnips, gorgeous greens and cauliflower cheese.

Michael, the chef, took the time to come out and talk to us, which gave it the personal touch.

The only reason I haven’t given this 5 stars is that they had run out of the roast chicken, which was my daughter’s first choice. Also, quite a few of the wines were out of stock.

We went at 7.30pm on a Sunday evening and I guess they were a victim of their own success.",Date of visit: October 2019,Elnecot,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
