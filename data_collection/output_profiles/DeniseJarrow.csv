Fantastic restaurant,"This restaurant is totally first class from the food to the excellent customer service.
The setting is amazing with stunning views of Lourdas bay. It’s the perfect setting for a romantic meal it’s also the most perfect place for a wedding. Kostas and his staff are dedicated to ensure that all of their customers both old and new have a perfectly memorable time. It’s kostas attention to detail and willingness to tailor every wedding to the bride and grooms needs that make this place stand out from the rest.
If you want to pick the perfect place to begin your life together then you must choose the andromeda. It’s really important to Kostas that everyone who visits the andromeda has a brilliant time and leaves with beautiful memories he and his staff work really hard to ensure that all of his guests receive the same very high standard of service.

Kostas also has a great sense of fun and creates a real buzz with both his guests and staff which means it’s a really relaxing place to be.

I can’t recommend this place enough if your thinking of getting married on kefalonia then please consider the andromeda. Don’t look at photos go visit it will steal your heart xx",Date of visit: July 2019,Andromeda Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best day ever,"This was our second trip with Antonia and it was every bit as good as the first. The trip itself is really well organised and because of bad weather we had to reschedule. Antonia kept us fully informed while she rescheduled everyone in trying to make sure everyone could go before the end of there holiday.
On the day of the trip we were greeted by Antonia and welcomed on board and coffee and delicious cake is served.We were taken out to sea where we watched nets being cast and then we travelled a little further and watch some nets being brought back. The catch from these nets became our lunch. We then headed to a small bay for a swim in the sea whilst our lunch was cooked.
There was plenty of time to relax ,swim and get to know our fellow passengers. Antonia answered any questions we had.
The food arrived and to say it was amazing doesn’t do it justice we dined like royalty. I can’t believe so much fantastic food came out of such a small galley. This was a feast not just lunch. If carlsberg did lunches this would be it !!!
We then cast some more nets and returned back to the jetty.
The day was made extra special by our fellow passengers they were a lovely group even the kids on board were good company especially our new friend Innis !
This is a full days trip which I would highly recommend. Antonia and the rest of the crew are very welcoming and more than happy to chat with you and answer any questions you may have. It’s so well organised they make it look easy which I’m sure it’s not.
If your looking for a trip that’s a little different then you must try this it’s a brilliant day!!",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best restaurant on kefalonia,This restaurant is really something very very special. With spectacular views looking out over Lourdas Bay and mount Aenos this place is perfect for couples looking for a romantic setting and families enjoying each other’s company. The decor is sumptuous and you could be forgiven if you thought this place would be really expensive. The food is exceptional served piping hot and presented better than a 5 star restaurant! The staff are very nice and welcome you like old friends. Greek nights are brilliant with a Greek style buffet. So if your looking for something a little bit different you have to visit the andromeda,Date of visit: July 2018,Andromeda Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Simply the best fishing trip ever !!,This is a brilliant fishing trip. Our hosts were very nice and welcomed us on board serving delicious food throughout the day and showing us a fisherman’s typical working day. From casting the nets to bringing in the catch it’s fascinating. Then a stop off to swim in the sea whilst our catch was cooked. Can’t recommend this enough we will certainly be back next year. Thank you Antonia you have helped us create some lovely memories!,Date of experience: July 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Eleni Studios,Just returned from our stay at the Eleni Studios in Kefalonia. We have stayed at these studios 14 times and always return because of the friendly welcome and the high standard of cleanliness. These are perfect for a chill out holiday. Over the years we have seen many changes at the Eleni Studios however this year was by far the best yet anyone who has visited over the past few years may have been put off from returning because the pool bar was not open on an evening. I am really pleased that this has changed and it's now open all day too. It's run by Jenna during the day and Marianna at night both of these lovely ladies are really nice nothing us too much trouble for them . There is a barbecue on a Tuesday evening with music from the lovely Tonia. It's like going back to the first few years when we visited the Eleni and enjoyed great nights there . If you've not been before I would highly recommend a visit . Kostas owns the studios and he ensures that everything is running to the best standards. It's been wonderful can't wait to go back .,Date of stay: June 2016,Eleni Studios Lourdas,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best restaurant in Kefalonia The Andromeda,"This is the most stunning restaurant in Kefalonia not sure what's best the fantastic food or the breathtaking views. Let's start with the staff they are all focused on providing the highest quality customer service ,they are really friendly and approachable. Kostas owns the restaurant and is always around chatting with customers ensuring your visit is special. Joanna and Gerry are also really nice and will give advice on what you might like to order. The food is wonderful over the years I think know may have tried most of the dishes with the exception of a few new ones they are all cooked to the highest standards and taste fantastic. The prices are reasonable considering such high standards and fabulous surroundings. It's a perfect place to get married or to renew your vows this is something else Kostas specialises in . The Greek night every Thursday is really entertaining with local dancers who encourage their audience to join in. There is a buffet with a wide range of foods. If your visiting Kefalonia you need to visit this restaurant for an experience you won't forget !",Date of visit: June 2016,Andromeda Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Utterly fantastic,"Where do I start we visited the Andromeda most nights on a 2 week holiday in Lourdas. The food as always was fantastic ,Kostas is definately without doubt the best chef on the island (if not in Greece!). The whole experience of visiting the Andromeda is superb from the excellent service to the breathtaking view from the dining area.

Both Kostas and Teresa go that extra mile to make customers old and new feel like old friends . The ambience of the place is amazing both for those of you of a more romantic disposition and those wishing to meet new friends.

I would highly reccomend the Greek nights the buffet has a good variety of food which is all delicious.. Also the Greek band and dancers are highly entertaining there is also an opportunity to try some Greek dancing .

The Andromeda is also available for weddings and I could'nt think of a more perfect setting to begin married life .

Definately the best restaurant on the island !!!!!!!",,Andromeda Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
