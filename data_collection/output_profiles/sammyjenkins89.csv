"Clean, good food and lovely staff","We have stayed here for the past 10 days without any complaints.
Breakfast was nice (we only ate there a couple of times as we aren't really breakfast people).
Not able to comment on dinner at the Petit Palais as we didn't eat in there. We prefer to the local cuisine when we are away.
Room was cleaned every day but a friendly cleaner. Bar staff are very chatty and helpful and make the best gyros pita.
Reception staff always have a smile on their faces and speak better English than some people living in England!!
Only downfall is majority of the rooms do not have a balcony and sometimes sitting on a balcony with a cold beer at the end if the day is nice.
Thank you for a wonderful stay and we will use the Mitsis chain again.",Date of stay: July 2019,Mitsis La Vita Beach Hotel,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Good Souvlaki and Mousaka but a rush to get us out!,"I tried mousaka in a couple of places and this was hands down the best! My partner had a lamb dish (Greek special but I can't recall the name of it) which came with roasties however half the lamb was fatty and inedible ( but being British we didn't complain at the time, only when we left the restaurant ha)!
We did return for a second time to see the traditional Greek entertainment to be told it started at 7.30 however it didn't start until 9pm and we had finished our meal by then and the staff were keen to get rid of us as they were pretty busy!",Date of visit: July 2019,Restaurant Agalma,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Wonderful Greek cuisine,"We ate here twice on our trip. Lovely food, sadly I didn't take any photos. Lamb shank literally fell off the bone and the ""Greek pasta"" was to die for. Staff are very attentive and polite.",Date of visit: July 2019,Louis Restaurant Pizzeria,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Wowza! Incredible food,"We ate here our first and last night in Rhodes.
Gyros and Souvlaki were the best we tried and I would recommend this to any one. Does get very busy but the staff will always find you a table.
Overall good service and yummy food.",Date of visit: July 2019,Memphis BBQ Grill,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Best cocktails and staff on the Island,"We spent 10 out of our 10 nights in Rhodes in the Arena! Cocktails are to die for. Worked my way through the Daiquiri menu on the first night and proceeded to every night after.
Staff are beyond friendly and make you feel welcome. Who doesn't love a hug, a kiss and a high five when you get there and when you leave!
We only ate here once (rookie mistake) but the food was incredible. We wish we had eaten here more as the food all looked lovely.
Thank you for making our trip!!",Date of visit: July 2019,Arena Sports Bar & Grill,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great fishing trip!,"Had never been on a fishing trip before, my boyfriend convinced me this would be a great way to spend our last day in Rhodes.

Managed to catch a dragon fish and some other little ones, quite enjoyed it considering I thought fishing was ""boring"".

Beer, soft drinks, great bbq with salad and garlic bread. Captain and his mate very friendly and helpful.

Only downside is my boyfriend waking up today with food poisioning. I don't eat fish and I am okay. Only thing it could have been was the fish. Apart from that would 100% recommend this experience to all!",Date of experience: July 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Polish adventure,"Perfect for a weekend break, staff are very friendly and food in the restaurant is very good and well priced. Local amenities are excellent from shops, shopping mall, chemist and nightlife, restaurants and bars are a plenty and only a 5 minute walk.",Date of stay: September 2018,Q Hotel Plus Katowice,4,"Katowice, Poland"
