An excursion to remember,"We had our trip 4 days ago with a group of 6. Something you shouldn't miss in Skiathos. A beautiful experience which we love in every second. We discovered places we haven't been plus we had some stops at Tsugrias and Lalaria. We had beautiful lunch cooked by captain Dimitris and amazing fruits salads.
What you will expect is ....swimming at the most beautiful places on Skiathos, some snorkeling, delicious meal, drinks and of course dont forget to capture some beautiful skiathos spots. Highly recommend",Date of experience: August 2020,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,1,"Skiathos, Greece"

Absolutely amazing.,We visit hotel Corali middle of may . We found this 2* hotel (????) In a very good price. On our arrival we realise an amazing hotel with extremely polite staff . Rooms we been told were renovate last winter and also very clean with a stunny view of the beach. Breakfast...facilities.... swimming pool...location and staff make this hotel at least 4 * . We will definitely go back on 2018. Just some information of the hotel. Hotel is located less than 1 minute walk from troulos beach. And maybe 5 minutes with a bus from famous beach koukounaries. Bus stop exactly in from of the hotel and in 12-15 minutes you can be in skiathos town. Busses running every 15 minutes. We loved everything in our stay at hotel corali. Thank you.,Date of stay: May 2017,Hotel Korali,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Service to laugh....,"Where to start? First time in my life I didn't leave any tips to a restaurant. Doing this job 25 years I was completely disappointed by this restaurant. Me and my girfriend went there after she been there years ago and she liked it. As we walk in a really friendly waitress she ll sit us down on the table next to entrance which we like it cause was really busy and hot. TIMES ARE REAL. 25 MINUTE'S TO GET A MENU. manager laughing around and definitely no idea of job or really bored. When a customer walk in he run smiling with all this Italian welcomes, he never check if he had a table ready and he just walk them around. Finally a girl give us menu but still no drinks order. After being in restaurant for 40 minutes drinks came full of apologies of the lady she took our food order.another waiting of 20 minutes for starters which is good time but no for antipasto which are ready salamis and cheese.And here starts the fun all of 7or 8 waitress the came to ask how starter was. No sections,,, no rules for each one and the MANAGER keep laughing around with GRACIAS TUTTO BENNE ETC. Food came and was another disappointed for my girfriend. I had a plain spaghetti bolognese which was nice and my girfriend pasta with chicken and mushrooms wick was straight from tin to cook. No salt no herbs the most FLAT TASTE EVER. We ask 2 waiters for salt.........all came to ask for food like chickens running around salt never came . At that point the whole dine end up laughing of how bad organise they were. Biggest laugh 5 of them ask us for desert menu. I am not angry with the young girls cause everyone start a job learning by time and built experience but the manager should have a break. Should tell him when very happy came to say bonna note to us",Date of visit: October 2016,Trattoria Rustica,1,"Norwich, United Kingdom"
Amazing atmosphere,We been there with my girlfriend and we were satisfied from atmosphere food and service. Had homemade tortilla for starters and feta in red peppers.
