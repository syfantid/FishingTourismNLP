Amazing Holiday.,"We have just returned from 2 weeks holiday at the Astra Village and we had a wonderful time. It's a beautiful hotel in a beautiful setting, the breakfast was lovely and so much to choose from and the bar snacks were equally as nice , we didn't get chance to eat in the Elias restaurant .
Special thanks to the lady who kept our room lovely and clean every day and also Chris behind the bar who was lovely and friendly and made a very good Zombie Cocktail and not forgetting Alex also who was equally as friendly.
We loved every minute of our holiday and Svoronata and are hoping to return again the same time next year, thank you all once again see you soon.",Date of stay: September 2018,Astra Village Hotel & Suites,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Another Fab Holiday at our favourite Hotel on Santorini,"Well what can I say that I haven't already said about this hotel, stayed here for 18 days in August/September and it was amazing as usual and in the perfect location right on the Beach.
We stayed in a room at the back which was spacious and clean, George,Evie, Manos.Nikos and all the staff cannot do enough for you, nothing is too much trouble, this was our 8th time to Santorini and our 6th time staying at the Seaside, we have already booked to go back again in May for a week.
Also their restauraunt is lovely as well, the food is homecooked and very tasty, we have tried most things on their menu.
They make the best Mojhito on the Island, and let me tell you I have tried many and The Seaside's are by far the best, special thanks to the staff Nikos, Mario,Gregory and Mariabelle for making these Mojhito's and looking after us for our 18 days of bliss.
Cannot wait to see you all in May 2015.",Date of stay: August 2014,Seaside Beach Hotel,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Tasty Greek Food,"During our stay at The Seaside Beach Hotel we must have dined in the restauraunt at least every other day, the food is home cooked and very tasty as always and at very reasonable prices, the service was excellent and the waiters were lovely. I would say my favourite meal was the Kleftico and i loved the Spaghetti Bolognese, i would highly recommend eating here and i will be going back next year.",Date of visit: September 2013,Sea Side Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Wonderful Hotel,"We have just returned from 2 wonderful weeks at The Seaside Beach Hotel, this was our 5th stay . From the moment George picked us up from the airport and Manos dropped us back for our return journey it was perfection for 2 weeks. We stayed for the second time in room 25 and it was a spacious, spotless clean lovely room, in a peaceful location at the back of the hotel . The beach is right in front of the hotel, what more could you ask for, i would not stay anywhere else in Santorini . Oh and the new seating area at the front is wonderful, we spent most of our evenings there drinking wine and the lovely cocktails made by Nikos and Mirabelle watching the world go by and chilling out . The family are so very warm and friendly and cannot do enough for you George ,Manos,Nikos,Evie, Maria and all the staff we shall see you next year",Date of stay: September 2013,Seaside Beach Hotel,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Great Food,"This was our second time to Kiwi, we dined here in September 2011, and the food and service was excellent on both occasions, the staff are very friendly and we were very impressed with everything overall, there were 5 of us and we all had the Chicken and Sweetcorn soup and Ribs to start with , and i has Sweet and Sour Chicken with Rice . I would highly recommend this Chinese Restauraunt if you fancy a change from all the lovely Greek food that's on offer in Kamari.",Date of visit: September 2013,Kiwi,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Average,"This was my 6th visit to Kamari and my first time dining at The Almira, there were 5 of us altogether and we were seated at the very front next to the wall as it was very busy with what looked like was a huge pre wedding meal, i had heard fab reviews of this place over the years so was excited to try it, i had the Mushrooms with chesse to start, the mushrooms were lovely,but the cheese was very bland and had no taste whatsoever to it, the waiter said it was Feta but it couldn't have been as i've been eating Feta for years and it has a lovely salty taste, i had the Village Rissotto for my main which was quite nice.
Overall i was quite dissappointed and don't think i will dine here in the future.",Date of visit: September 2013,Almira Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"

Very Tasty Home cooked Greek Food !!,"I have just returned from 1 week staying at The Seaside Hotel, and as always the food was great , lovely home cooked fresh tasty Greek food cooked by Maria , we ate here most nights and quite a few lunch times, I think i have almost gone through the menu as this is my third time staying here, it's difficult to choose as you are spoilt for choice.

Delicious Food As Always.,"Having just returned from 2 weeks staying at the Seaside Hotel for the second time,the food and service is excellent as always, it's hard to choose what to eat because everything is so good that's on the menu,we travelled out in a group of six,and four more joined us so there were ten of us in total,and every one of us ate at the Seaside most lunchtimes and evenings,and not one of us had anything to complain about only that we were to full,i recommend that you try the garlic mushrooms they are to die for,and the delicious homemade soups,for main course try the swordfish steak, and the traditional Greek dishes are also excellent. In a nutshell this an excellent restauraunt and very good value for money.",,Sea Side Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"
The best place to stay in Santorini.,"I wouldn't stay anywhere else other than here,stayed for 2 weeks in September 09,with friends of ours,who also love it. The service received from George,Manos,Nikos,and all the staff was fabulous,they are all great people,cannot do enough for you.
We stayed in room 25,and it was very,very clean and spacious,the location of the hotel is perfect,so relaxing,and right on the beach,the food is also amazing,and it's all home cooked from scratch.We have already booked our place for 2 weeks next September,can't wait to get back there.",Date of stay: September 2009,Seaside Beach Hotel,4,"Santorini, Greece"
