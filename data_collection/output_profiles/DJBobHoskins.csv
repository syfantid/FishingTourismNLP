Burritos! Burritos! Burritos!,"Well knock me down with a Mexican jumping bean, we finally have a premium burrito vendor in Hitchin! I knew this day would come...and this day tastes delicious!

I consider myself to be a bit of a burrito connoisseur and have visited the finest Mexican cantinas in the city...however, move aside London; there's a new kid on the rural block and it's kicking yo' ass!

Had to go for the supersized beef chipotle with Green Goblin sauce. Loved it. Want another. Will be back. It was so tender and generously stuffed with the freshest ingredients, oooh lovely!

Back soon to go for a hotter sauce as the Green Goblin only tickled me a bit. But it was a great introduction to Cantina Carnitas for sure.

Saddle up and bounce down to the best new eatery since sliced bread. It's where the old record shop used to be, on Buckles.

Best on the Leisure Park,"Popped into TGI Friday's after seeing a film in the Cineworld cinema complex and was highly impressed. I'd not been before and assumed it was just going to be yet another sub-par 'chain restaurant' but I couldn't have been more wrong - shame on me!

My nephew and I were welcomed by a very helpful and approachable front of house hospitality staff member who told us she would have a table ready in 5mins. Not only did she direct us to the bar but waited until we received our drinks before guiding us to our seats. She introduced us to our waiter and we were promptly served our meals after making a selection from a delicious menu choice.

The food was disguised (unwittingly) as 'cheap and cheerful' through the menu design and fun name descriptions but there was a genuine craftsmanship to the food and it tasted incredible! I was hugely impressed by everything this place had to offer, from the razor sharp service, to the pleasant chat of the barman, funky fresh interior design and amazing quality of the food.

I'll definitely recommend TGI Friday's to friends and family based on this visit. I'll certainly be returning soon myself, that's for sure. Fab!",Date of visit: December 2018,Tgi Fridays,4,"Stevenage, United Kingdom"
The ultimate crowd pleaser,"My wife and I (with baby in tow) popped in on a whim today; which we certainly didn't regret.

After finding the last small table nestled within the busy interior we were welcomed by a friendly waitress who gave us a quick intro to the restaurant. At the bar there was a wide selection of drinks and a jolly buzz of activity happening between bar and kitchen staff. I was seen swiftly and greeted by Jim (whom I assumed was the manager), started a tab and the rest was easy.

The sheer diversity of Granello Lounge was the thing which caught my eye above all. There's something for everyone. Whether it's a quick bite to eat at lunch, a venue for a business meeting over coffee, a family gathering or an alternative to the local pub - this place has it all.

If you're a fussy eater or someone with a food intolerance, then this is definitely one for you. The easy going bar staff are sensitive to dietary requirements and they will thoroughly check to make sure your meal is tailored to suit your needs. A highly commendable level of customer service.

To wrap this review up; if you're next decision to grab some delicious grub in Hitchin commands a venue that has great service, great staff, great food, great choice, great hospitality and overall greatness, Granello Lounge is a sure fire winner for you. Get yourselves over there NOW!

Tongue tingling tour!,"Wow, I had an incredible experience at Edible Ornamentals on a tasting tour! I seriously urge and strongly recommend everyone to try it.

I visited with a friend (Mark P on TripAdvisor) and we had a great time, learned a few things and bought some exceptionally tasty chilli sauces.

The owner, Shawn, was passionate about what he does and he took great pride in what he's achieved. He was full of information and the homemade sauces he's created (along with his talented chef Chilli Olly) were a real triumph. You have to try his steak brisket chilli con carne - delicious!

The whole team here are doing something great so show your support and pay them a visit. They'll turn you from a chilli lover into a chilli enthusiast, just like they've done to me - in a single visit!

Simply fantastic and utterly impressive.",Date of experience: November 2017,Edible Ornamentals,4,"Chawston, United Kingdom"
Sunday Roast Supreme!,"I recently went on a mission to find the best gastropubs in the North Herts area. One of the places on my list to visit was The Bushel and Strike so my wife and I thought we'd put it to the test and visit on a Sunday.

After being greeted by the exceptionally friendly staff on arrival we were guided to our table and offered a drink straight away. Our waitress was assigned to us and helpfully gave us a run down of the menu to which we both ordered a Sunday roast beef dinner (as a classic benchmark test). It wasn't long before our food arrived and we were presented with a delicious-looking helping of the usual trimmings you'd expect. However, the taste was even better than the way it looked. The gravy had that wonderfully sticky texture to it and the vegetables were sinfully buttery! Amazing roast potatoes straddled the generous amount of thickly cut beef slices accompanied by a plethora of well-seasoned veg.

After marvelling in the succulent flavours of the main, the dessert list wasn't as varied as I'd have expected. As someone who doesn't eat nuts there wasn't much for me to choose from. Most of the desserts were nut-based so I could only really choose from the ice cream menu, avoiding the peanut butter flavour of course!

Aside from the limited dessert menu, the whole experience was definitely a good one. We had a great time, left extremely satisfied and then enjoyed a wonderful walk around the Ashwell Springs.

The Bushel and Strike have set the bar high and I'm intrigued to see if the next few places on my list are able to live up to these expectations.

A great visit!",Date of visit: September 2017,The Bushel and Strike,4,"Ashwell, United Kingdom"
Friendliest bar in London! Must visit!,"I work next door at Saatchi & Saatchi and the guys at The Pregnant Man have been looking after us since January 2017. During this time they've gone above and beyond to make us all feel like old friends every time we visit. I'm particularly impressed by the service, knowledge and complete approachability of every member of staff and they really do enjoy being part of an extended family.

You're never alone when you visit the team here and they always wear a genuine smile on their faces. The food is excellent and the pizza oven produces the best pizzas this side of Italy. The entire menu is littered with delicious grub to really get the endorphins buzzing and great pride is taken with each dish served. Likewise, the drinks on offer will leave you spoilt for choice and the whole selection is reasonably priced; especially when you balance quality against value.

The interior design is stylish, cosy and perfect for any occasion. Welcoming and warming in the winter, cool and chic in the summer, The Pregnant Man is a place you don't want to pass by without visiting.

My favourite local away from home. Hands down.",Date of visit: September 2017,The Pregnant Man,4,"London, United Kingdom"
The time of our lives!,"It’s almost as if Santorini was beckoning us over for our honeymoon. What a fantastic place! We had so much fun and thoroughly enjoyed exploring the island while we were there – what a truly fabulous way of life.

Jon met us at the airport in his jeep which couriered our luggage to the villa while we sat back in the taxi he’d arranged to pick us up. The villa was less than a 10min drive from the airport and we were utterly amazed at how nice the place was. Jon has obviously invested time and money into making it look so beautiful. It was built right into the cliff which made the interior so quirky, spacious and cool with the added bonus of having a superb sun deck complete with plunge pool and a jaw-dropping view of the sea. You can even see the airport and all the planes coming in to land which makes for fascinating viewing while you bob up and down at the poolside with a beer or glass of wine. Total bliss!

Aside from the warm, friendly greetings from Jon and his most excellent hosting skills, he also gave us a full tour of the best places to visit around the south side of Santorini. He’s colloquially and affectionately known as the ‘Mayor of Santorini’ because of his ability to make friends with the locals and help drum up some business for them. I must stress, he’s not trying to get you to book trips or reserve tables in restaurants but merely passing on his guidance so you can make the most of your stay. Every single place he recommended was genuinely amazing and we wouldn’t have done as well if we’d have tried to tailor our honeymoon ourselves, despite our adventurous nature. He’s a great guy (originally from Maine in the states) who knows how to have fun and is always on hand to help book restaurants, give advice etc.

Make sure you visit the close-by winery called Art Space. You get a wonderful tour of the building’s history and a chance to sample quite a few drinks for only €5! Also, try and explore the non-tourist parts of the island as there’s so much more to experience away from the regular sights and tourist traps. Having said that, the whole of Santorini is unapologetically stunning so wherever you find yourself, you’ll be surrounded by beauty.

Santorini is a must-see for any newlyweds. But remember, when booking, make the right choice and book Jon’s villa.",Date of stay: July 2017,Santorini Holiday Villa,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Simply Amazing.,"On the second or third day of our honeymoon we were lucky enough to have a pre-booked reservation at this fantastic restaurant by our host. Tables are in high demand so if you want to visit please make sure you book well in advance. It’s certainly worth the effort!

High above the rooftops in Exo Gonia this delightful restaurant has wonderful views of the sea below. If you time it right, you can sit outside on the terrace (just after the sun has disappeared) to enjoy the gentle breeze after a hot day. Situated at the foot of a majestic church; the scene has been set to make your dining experience a dramatic one.

As with most Santorinian restaurants you’ll have plenty of fine choice on the well-constructed menu. To compliment your food, they also have a sensational selection of wine as well as the traditional, local drinks that are usually given out as part of the friendly hospitality. With this in mind, the staff are very approachable and can help guide your choice in case you can’t decide between the equally delicious dishes.

I’d recommend visiting Metaxi Mas for all occasions, whether you’d like a romantic meal for two or a fun night out as a family or group of friends.

Wonderful.",Date of visit: July 2017,Metaxy Mas,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Pure Santorini at its best.,"After driving through the quiet and atmospheric streets of Megalochori, you suddenly find yourself in the heart of the town but with no time to put the brakes on. It’s such as small place that we actually had to drive back around to the town’s entrance a second time! But it’s definitely worth it as the town square is full of colourful flowers, traditional music, lively conversations and a wonderfully relaxed ambience.

It was just before lunchtime when my wife and I decided to dine at Marmita so it was fairly quiet. We were shown to a well-placed table recommended by the waiter and he promptly brought us our ice-cold drinks and some menus. In fact, the service throughout our meal was perfect and everyone was so friendly, even when the restaurant became more and more busy. The fact that more people kept turning up to eat was a good sign and it really helped create a nice atmosphere, including the arrival of a guitar duo which was great.

The food was incredible. It was so well presented and the chef clearly had talent. The seafood was fresh and delicious and incorporated a very modern twist – worthy of fine dining gastronomy. The menu was varied without having too much to choose from and every dish sounded amazing. My only criticism is that it was quite an expensive lunch and worked out to about 85-90 euros for the two of us – almost double the price of most other restaurants at that time of the day. However, we didn’t mind too much as the price matched the quality and presentation of the food.

An extremely enjoyable venue to take a slower pace away from the usual tourist spots. Delightful.",Date of visit: July 2017,Marmita,4,"Santorini, Greece"
One of the best things to do in Santorini!,"From a recommendation through our guide 'Jon Call', we accidentally found ourselves up a small road and followed the signposts to Art Space; a delightfully situated winery off the beaten track...

By pure accident, we parked up, went inside the winery and found ourselves on a tour of the place which opened up into the most amazing historic building that served as a working distillery AND an art gallery! Our guide was incredible. She certainly knew her stuff and, to add as a real treat, toured our way around the various structures with the final bonus of a small 5€ fee to try 4 wines and 4 spirits.

We loved one of the wines so much that we bought the 'reserve' white wine version and had such a good time!

Please visit this place with the attention, respect and amazement it deserves.

Top marks!",Date of experience: August 2017,Art Space,4,"Santorini, Greece"
BEST DAY OUT!,"We're on our honeymoon and were recommended this excursion by our host; Jon Call. It was one of our top highlights of our holiday!

Anthe runs the most outstanding fishing boat experience you can find in Santorini. She's intelligent, a great inspiration and speaks excellent English. You can really sense how much respect for the sea she has and she certainly knows what she's talking about.

We both had a thrilling time out on the ocean which was heightened by Anthe's love of what she does as well as her hardworking crew; Hassan and Muhammad. They were all so very nice, hospitable and wonderful to be around.

After a short amount of time out at sea we reeled in the nets from the night before and had ourselves a wonderfully varied catch of fish and sea creatures. We even caught a lobster and an octopus!! Wow!

The guys cook what they catch while you can jump in the warm, clear waters and then everyone eats together and has a civilised conversation before heading back to the harbour.

I would highly recommend and thoroughly urge people to book themselves a trip with these guys...you definitely won't be disappointed.

Simply wonderful.",Date of experience: August 2017,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Words cannot do this wonderful place justice...,"Oh my goodness me, well, well, well. What can I say...? Visit. Visit. Visit.

I've cycled past the Red Lion down the road from The Green Man so many times but never once realised 'The Green Man' even existed until a few weeks ago. I must apologise to the owners. Sorry.

This first thing that hits you right between the eyes is the utterly breathtaking views out to the open countryside from the rear beer garden and (almost bird's eye view) of Hitchin. Fantastic. And if you can tear yourself away from these spectacular sights then prepare to be served by the most charming bar staff who love to have a chat whilst pouring your favourite beverage; they're so friendly.

I took some friends back for a Sunday roast after discovering this truly hidden gem and the food was absolutely INCREDIBLE. We each had these enormous beef racks with gut-busting amounts of vegetables and yorkshires which surpassed any Sunday roast I've had in the past two years; easily. Additionally, the waitresses were typically friendly and were so efficient in the way they looked after us. I can't wait to go back and visit soon.

Breathtaking views, wonderful people behind the scenes and fabulously tasting food with a fairly low-cost price tag makes The Green Man and absolute must-visit the next time you're near the area.

"Warm welcome, cycle friendly","What a great pub! Always a pleasure to visit and the drinks are 'better-than-reasonable' in price. If you're into your cycling you're always in good company. The silence of the countryside engulfs you but there's always a distant sound of laughter and conversation to make you feel welcome.

A fantastic English boozer which connects you to the past. What a way to de-stress from the chaos of a modern, hectic lifestyle.

Love it!",Date of stay: May 2017,Red Lion,4,"Offley, United Kingdom"
Your very own piece of England,"Just what the doctor ordered! If you're looking for somewhere to chill with friends on a summer's day, look no further. The Red Lion has it all! Great food, better drinks and the best company. The ultimate stop-off for any budding cyclist, especially on those lazy summers days.

In a word, the Red Lion is 'fandabbydosie'.

MUST SEE! Yorkshire Pud Heaven!,"As it turned out, luck was on our side when we visited this gem of a pub yesterday. It does a Sunday roast to end all Sunday roasts! What can I say…well, aside from the fact the vegetables were incredibly fresh and cooked to perfection, the roast potatoes were nothing short of spectacular and the Yorkshire pudding was about the size of my head! The entire visit was so good that I’ve officially crowned it as my number one Sunday roast venue.

But there’s so much more to talk about! The staff were utterly amazing in the way they really looked after you, as well as their general demeanor. You could tell everyone got along and no one was stressing out – despite the fact a party of 42 people were about to arrive!! Incredible!

Absolutely top marks all round. If you’re looking for fantastic food, a truly wide variety of drinks, somewhere to kick back with friends or a place to celebrate an event, make your booking NOW.

Thank you so much to ALL the staff for your attentiveness, cooking talent, premium service and warm welcome. We’ll be seeing you very soon!",Date of visit: April 2017,The Three Horseshoes Inn Restaurant,4,"Letchworth, United Kingdom"
No wonder it’s the best!,"Twice I’ve been to Los Reyes now and twice I’ve been completely blown away! The service in this place is unrivalled (in my opinion) against other restaurants in Hitchin. People tend to focus far too much on reviewing the food they’re given at restaurants and often neglect the service. If you have a good balance between the two you’re onto a winner and Los Reyes certainly delivers!

The first time I visited Los Reyes was because of a friend’s recommendation and the fact it had just opened. I had a thoroughly good time and the food was absolutely delicious. Not only that, but the waiter who served us was so passionate about his job he knew every detail about each dish and, actually, I disregarded the menu and simply asked him what I should go for. It worked a treat; as everything put in front of us was so appetizing. Tapas can be quite daunting for someone who might not be familiar with the cuisine and Spanish menus have a tendency to be jam-packed with options. Nevertheless, I had a great meal, fantastic wine and a brilliant experience.

Finally, my second visit was just as good…if slightly different. It was for a large birthday group and we had a set menu. Every single dish was even nicer than the one before and the restaurant manager (Warren, I think his name was) kept the drinks flowing. He had a great presence about him and was super-friendly. He had such natural hospitality skills and made everyone feel comfortable, at ease, involved and really added another dimension to the conversation. Very good.

Please visit Los Reyes. You’ll feel satisfied by the delicious food, blissful with the fantastic choice (and quality) of drinks, amazed by the excellent service and most importantly; you’ll have fun!",Date of visit: April 2017,Los Reyes,4,"Hitchin, United Kingdom"
Pure decadence...,"Wow. I hardly know where to begin.

Do I start by praising the staff for their incredible hospitality and knowledge of food and drink....or do I begin by describing the luxurious interior design...or perhaps I should kick things off with the sheer quality of food on offer...?! I'm torn.

Let's just say, you will NOT be disappointed with any aspect of the highly acclaimed, highly delightful, highly regarded 'M' restaurant in Victoria. Words cannot describe the pure decadence and fantastically run experience you receive during a visit to this wonderful corner of heavenly beauty. Whether you're a 'foodie' or a connoisseur of fabulous drinks; I urge you to pay these guys a visit for a truly memorable and pleasurable evening of total luxury.

One of the best showcases of food and drink which London has to offer. Book now!",Date of visit: February 2017,M Restaurant,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Good fun for kids and adults alike!,"A group of us (3 children and 6 adults) went here for my nephew's birthday and we chose to play the 'jungle' themed crazy golf course. We had a great time and, by the time we'd finished all 18 holes, couldn't believe we'd been playing for two whole hours.

This is definitely the craziest crazy golf course I've been to, with lots of fun holes littered with bumps, jumps and fantastic props to really put your skills to the test. The scenery/layout was very well designed and the actual state of the building was in fantastic condition.

We were so engrossed in the game that we didn't realise you could actually grab a drink from the bar - something to bear in mind for next time, although we were busy enough concentrating on the game!

Brilliant all-round fun for the whole family and I'll be looking forward to returning to play the other course!",Date of experience: December 2016,Mr Mulligans Stevenage,4,"Stevenage, United Kingdom"
Local luxury,"Redcoats is renowned, in the local area, for being a cut above the rest; somewhere to really make an impression and/or to treat someone special.

I stayed in one of the superior rooms which absolutely oozed character and transported you back in time a few hundred years. Everything from the creaking floorboards to the exposed timber beams wrapped you up into a cosy and intimate setting, a romantic gesture which puts you into full relaxation mode.

The rustic-chic food is impeccably sourced and fabulously cooked, while the cellar is full to bursting with sensational wines - some empties of which are displayed within the bar (I'm sure I spotted a jeroboam or two dotted in between the timbers!).

Being on the outskirts of Hitchin, a trip into town on your first or second night is a must-do. Spend the morning walking around the stunning countryside, the day shopping, the evening dining and grab a taxi back to Redcoats for a well-earned nightcap. Heaven!

I'm always quick to recommend Redcoats so be sure to create your own adventure...starting right here!",Date of stay: December 2016,The Farmhouse at Redcoats,4,"Hitchin, United Kingdom"
Destroy all preconceptions of a hotel and then build them up again in the shape of Citizen M,"This is how a hotel should be!

I could not have been happier with my stay at Citizen M Bankside. I knew it'd be a great choice for my fiancee's birthday treat - we're both designers and the creative interior inside the hotel is a visual spectacle! Every facet of the cosy, colourful lounge areas/living rooms has the most comfortable furniture which you can totally relax in. If it weren't for the surprise plans I already had booked in the nearby area we could've stayed there all weekend quite happily!

The self check-in was so smooth and easy to use. And just in case you needed some assistance there was always a hotel ambassador nearby to give you a helping hand. Soon after we checked in we thought we'd explore the environment of the interior rather than go straight to our room - at no point did we feel rushed or obliged to follow the usual blueprints when staying at a hotel. It was so refreshing!

Once we'd finally decided to leave the lavishly decorated lobby and head up to the room; we found ourselves fiddling around with the abundance of gadgets and playing with the iPad which controlled everything from the lighting to the curtain blinds and television. The wake-up alarms and 'moods' are so funny - you must try them all!

Drinks are available until the early hours and are always served by a friendly face. The prices are tilting towards the steeper end but this was a special occasion so I didn't mind paying a premium, particularly in such fantastic surroundings.

The hotel is situated just behind Shakespeare's Globe theatre and (at the time of our visit) many Christmas markets along Bankside and Southbank. There's so many things to see and do on this side of the river which has made me feel like my horizons have been infinitely broadened.

Citizen M is just close enough to the thick of it whilst simultaneously being set back from the hubbub that they seem to have found the perfect balance for a short city break. One of the many things I'm everlastingly grateful for is that Citizen M has stirred up a genuine interest inside me to go and make more use of the area and to visit south of the river much more often!

Thank you so much to everyone at Citizen M. We truly had a blast!",Date of stay: November 2016,CitizenM London Bankside,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Floaty boaty birthday treat!,"From the booking of a table online to actually being seating, the Tattershall Castle was an exceptional experience - one I'll be happy to return to soon!

It was my fiancee's birthday so I thought I'd treat her to a meal aboard the Tattershall Castle with a glorious view of the London Eye from our table. Stunning! The restaurant had such a fun atmosphere with tonnes of laughter and with everyone in the mood for a good night out.

At this point, I have to say, I'm convinced the staff have super powers. The food and drinks orders we gave were dealt with so quickly and effortlessly without being rushed - and yet the food was of such a premium standard; I could't believe it!

For two people who had starters as well as steak mains and drinks the bill was less than £70 so naturally we were very pleased. There was a good choice on the menu (not too much clutter but a wide variety) and everything was very reasonably priced, considering the location of the restaurant.

If you're looking for something different and have a great appetite for a quality menu in a fun and friendly environment, then the Tattershall Castle is definitely for you.

All aboard the best restaurant on the Thames!",Date of visit: November 2016,The Tattershall Castle,4,"London, United Kingdom"
"Great staff, great food","Other than sampling local food in Turkey itself, this is the first time I’ve ever been to a Turkish restaurant in the UK and I was very pleased with the whole experience. Great food, friendly service and a reasonable price made it a place definitely worth recommending and returning to.

I’ve been back twice since my first visit, so it must be good! The friendly service of the management and staff are second to none. They look after you every step of the way and you can be as formal or informal as you like. They regularly make sure everyone is happy, topped up with drinks and that your party are enjoying themselves.

Brace yourselves; it’s carb-city in there! There’s definitely not a diet-friendly menu so just bear in mind you’ll be more than likely loosening your belt at the end of your meal. Despite this however, our whole group left on a high note and we were all pleasantly surprised at the cost of the bill, which left us with enough cash to go for more drinks at another venue – not that we had room!",Date of visit: April 2016,Mevan Restaurant & Bar,4,"Hitchin, United Kingdom"
"Different, popular, exciting...I like it!","Great little place to take the kids...plus adults can get to be big kids too! There's tonnes of different flavours to choose from and something different to do come rain or shine. It definitely helps to break the day up if you're stuck for plans or need to kill some time and what's more, it seems to be a big hit with the locals - which is nice.

Be prepared to part with quite a lot of cash though! I think I spent about £25 for three portions of ice cream. Yikes! The smiles, memories and laughter was well worth it though.",Date of visit: February 2016,Fabio's Gelato Hitchin,4,"Hitchin, United Kingdom"
Always a winner,"The Millstream is a one of those places you find yourself going back to, time and time again. It’s brilliant in it’s versatility. Whether you want a quiet mid-week drink in a snug little corner, a Sunday roast with all the trimmings, Saturday night food and drinks with friends or you just fancy something to quench your thirst as you cycle around the Greenway; you’ll certainly find what you’re looking for at The Millstream.

Being a McMullen’s pub you’ll find plenty of choice on the menu and behind the bar. The staff are always friendly and they now offer table service – even if you’re just in there for a drink. Food quality is very high and there’s something for even the fussiest of eaters.

The large outside space can accommodate quite a few revelers in the summer and there’s plenty of room inside for large parties, it’s almost Tardis-like. Funnily enough however, depending on where you choose to sit, you can decide whether you’d prefer a quiet afternoon/evening or place yourself in the thick of it – it’s your choice.

There’s a quiz night mid-week too which is great fun and not too tricky so if that’s your thing then head down every Wednesday to give it a go.

In conclusion, The Millstream is a big hit with many people. The food is varied, fresh and delicious while drinks are competitively priced and not too expensive. The atmosphere is very comfortable and the staff make you feel welcomed from start to finish.

Nice one Millstream, you’re a winner!",Date of visit: August 2016,The Millstream,4,"Hitchin, United Kingdom"
More of this please!,"Not being a native to Welwyn Garden City I have only visited this venue twice. The first time it was a dusty old pub with mismatched furniture and dirty windows. My second visit, on the other hand, was a huge improvement I’m happy to say. It’s now a charming village pub with exquisite interior design, a mouthwatering menu and the most finely-tuned service I’ve experienced in a long while.

Unfortunately I was only able to spend an hour or so for lunch one Saturday so I just had a light snack from the clipboard menu. During my time here I noticed more and more people flocking in for a tasty bite to eat, making the most of the sunshine. I also hear it’s a popular choice for a drink whilst weddings are due to start in the church opposite – what a fantastic idea!

I’m hoping to return again the next time I’m in the area and I’m looking forward to having a more substantial meal over a longer period of time.

Can’t wait!",Date of stay: July 2016,Wellington at Welwyn,4,"Welwyn, United Kingdom"
Didn't live up to expectations unfortunately,"The decision was made at work. We were going for a team lunch and steak was the theme of the day. Black and Blue was the obvious choice for me seeing as it’s just a stone’s throw from my office.

With the expectation of receiving a very expensive bill at the end of lunch I was pleasantly surprised at the results. It was certainly cheaper than everyone thought which actually makes Black and Blue an affordable choice if you’re think of going for the lunchtime menu options. The cocktails were mixed at the bar and were expertly crafted to add to the splendour of the more adventurous amongst us. Inside there was a huge amount of room which obviously caters for large groups as well as a more intimate dining experience if that’s more your bag.

Unfortunately, seeing as our main goal was to go for a steak-based lunch, most of us were quite disappointed at the quality and size of the portions. Anyone who had ordered their meat cooked medium-rare received a tough, shrunken blob of well-done chewiness. Most unfortunate.

The service was fairly average too. Our waitress seemed uninterested in her demeanour and wasn’t exactly approachable which slightly affected our mood. Nevertheless, we gnawed our way through the rest of the food and still had a good time.

I think I had a preconception about the restaurant, which didn’t quite live up to how I imagined it to be. In any case, the total cost of drinks and a meal for ten people (or thereabouts) was surprisingly cheap so it’s definitely worth another visit. And perhaps under different circumstances.

Not bad.",Date of visit: May 2016,Black & Blue,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Best around for miles,"A boutique country inn if ever there was one, The Live and Let Live is a fab little pub in a truly beautiful countryside surrounding.

I’ve been here a few times now and even considered it for my wedding day. It’s a great place to go and the food and drink is outstanding. They’re currently undergoing a transition in management but it looks as though everything is plodding along happily for the moment. I wish them every success during this time and hope there won’t be too much change to its already impeccable reputation.

The wide choices of drinks are very affordable and the food is beautifully cooked with a lot of care and attention. Reserving a few tables is a pleasant experience as the management staff are completely on the ball and treat everyone with great consideration. When you find yourself in the dining area, sitting under those gorgeous low beams, you feel extremely comfortable and relaxed. It’s almost like being in someone else’s home rather than a pub and you get a sense of the friendly rapport from the locals who go about their conversations at the bar.

Dining out in the beer garden is a wonderful affair where the rolling Pegsdon Hills wrap their arms around you as if to give you a big, green hug. Other than the odd car driving through the valley there’s almost no noise despite the roaring roads going into Hitchin and Luton on the other side of the landscape. It’s a genuine break from the hustle and bustle of towns and cities.

The Live and Let Live is a great choice for ramblers too. If you find yourself on one of the many walks the area has to offer you’ll most likely find time to stop off and have a well-earned drink. Also, the pub caters for those choosing to walk and the staff have great knowledge of the different routes you can take. Maps, information, tips and more can be found inside so it’s almost a must when facing the elements.

Fantastic Stag Party event,"Situated in a beautiful part of the UK, this was an activity on the 'to do' list for a Stag Party I recently attended. The instructors were very helpful and knew the coastline like the back of their hand. After the initial safety intro we were all lead across rocky terrain to the water's edge before all 10 of us jumped into the freezing North Sea - a hangover cure if ever there was one! Once our bodies had adjusted to the temperature we found ourselves clambering around the stoney shore, back and forth into the crystal clear waters. Despite the bracing climate the surroundings were breathtaking and everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves. The climax of the 2hr trail culminated into a giant leap from a 40ft cliff into the sea below. Most of our party managed to brave the daredevil feat but the instructors didn't pressure anyone into something they couldn't/didn't want to do. I, for one, jumped from a slightly less macho height of 25ft but it was still an achievement for someone who has a problem with heights.

We really got on well with the two instructors (Alvin and Lee) and they offered some insight into the local area which went down very well with those of us in search of the hair of the dog, although the coasteering obliterated any side effects from the night before!

All in all, a very professional and friendly experience was provided and the Stag was in his element. I'd highly recommend this event for anyone who fancies a challenge as well as building on new friendships within a group.",Date of experience: September 2016,Adventure Northumberland,4,"Alnwick, United Kingdom"
Fantastically atmospheric,"I couldn't have been more pleased with the Mermaid restaurant. This was a well-researched venue for me; as I planned a proposal to my (now) fiancee back in June of 2016 in the St. Ives area. Hooray! She said YES!

The reason for booking our meal here was a 'backup plan' in case it rained during my proposal and I wanted to find the best Cornwall had to offer to make it a night to remember. I realise I'm doing the staff at the Mermaid an injustice when I say it was my 'backup plan' as the whole experience was totally amazing.

After being welcomed by the very approachable front of house staff we were shown to our perfectly located booth and cozied up under the dimly-lit, ambient lamp above our table. We received our drinks order promptly and then chose some of the freshest, most delicious seafood St. Ives could offer. The menu was brimming with excellent dishes and we really felt spoilt for choice. I had a sort of seafood-medley-hotpot which was sensational! The food and the drinks; when combined with the low beamed ceiling, soft lighting and abundance of maritime memorabilia, worked so well. You could easily forget about the world outside of the restaurant and simply bask in a relaxing and thoroughly satisfying environment.

I urge anyone visiting St. Ives to book a table here. The value for money against what you're served is nothing short of incredible. I can't remember the last time I had food as fresh and as flavoursome as this so I take my hat off to the unsung heroes behind the scenes. If they're as professional as the waitresses which served us then this restaurant is heading for big things to come.",Date of visit: June 2016,Mermaid Seafood Restaurant,4,"St Ives, United Kingdom"
A hidden Hertfordshire gem,"Swapping the bright lights of a Saturday night birthday party with a sobering Sunday roast instead might sound risky. Actually, I'd massively recommend it.

From the moment our party of about 12 meandered inside the gastropub, we were looked after and catered for by the front of house manager. Hugely hospitable, he showed us to our table and assigned a couple of waitresses to look after us all for the afternoon. Once the drinks had been served we were given the choice of some seriously succulent-sounding roast dinners. I thought I'd mix it up a bit and choose the pulled pork option rather than my standard roast beef preference; to which I was exceptionally pleased. You could tell immediately that a great deal of care and attention had gone into making a great roast dinner a superlative one. I was content.

Despite living in Hitchin for the majority of my adult life, I'd never visited the Hermit of Redcoats before. In fact, I didn't even realise it existed. So, for that reason, I'm planning on revisiting the pub at the next chance I get. The staff were fantastic, the value was good for the area and the setting worked perfectly for one of the last truly sunshine-flooded days of summer. Utterly awesome in every way.

Again please!",Date of visit: September 2016,Hermit of Redcoats,4,"Little Wymondley, United Kingdom"
I really want this place to do well,"I've visited the Rusty Gun a couple of times now (since the refurbishment in the early 2000's) and, despite my wishing and wanting, it has never really felt like it has improved. The decor looks great from the outside and you can see how much consideration has been spent on transforming the interior but there's something lacking. I think this falls down to the fact there never seems to be enough staff and, because of this, basic standards take a pounding. For instance, it's difficult to get through on the phone - it just rings and rings. Tables aren't properly wiped down/cleared before the next reservation is seated. I've arrived only to be turned away due to double-booking mix-ups etc. Like it says in the title of my review, ""I really want this place to do well"".

However, anywhere which has a Sunday carvery and serves red cabbage captures my attention immediately and I have to give the Rusty Gun it's dues on food quality. The beef was impeccably cooked and the chef on the carving station was a pleasure to talk to. After speaking to him I knew straight away just how seriously he took his role in the restaurant. Once I had my main dish on a plate I went to help myself to all the trimmings but, being their own worst enemy - as they consistently show me, the food was placed in a bizarrely positioned area right in the middle of the main walkway next to the bar. Not only that, I felt as though I needed night-vision goggles to actually see what was on offer due to the fact there were no lights above the station. However, once I'd snaked my way back to the table (and shed some light on the food I'd chosen) I was more than happy with the quality and flavours. I just felt disappointed that the front of house presentation of the food had let down the culinary talents of the kitchen staff. Food of such delicious quality should be made a fuss of and displayed on a shrine with plenty of lighting and access to it.

I'll try to visit again as I hate to see local venues under-performing. But then again, there's something inherently wrong, as a customer, with having to say, ""Perhaps this time they'll get it right"", whilst holding up both hands with crossed fingers.

Come on R.G, do me proud.",Date of visit: February 2016,The Rusty Gun,4,"Hitchin, United Kingdom"
She said YES!,"After an exhilarating week's camping in St. Ives and celebrating the fact my (now) fiancee said ""YES!"" to my marriage proposal, I had lined up a luxurious couple of nights stay at The Headland Hotel to round off a truly amazing holiday. The staff were made aware of my 'surprise' plans and were ever so charming in helping us have the time of our lives.

The hotel itself is somewhere I've always wanted to stay as I'm a big fan of Roald Dahl (this is where The Witches was filmed) and an even bigger fan of Newquay. It certainly exceeded my expectations and I was blown away by the grand interior which oozed history. This was made even better by the thorough tour of the building given to us by the lobby manager.

After being shown to our room we were ready to explore....but the phone rang. We were told to wait in our room while a member of staff came up to discuss something. Imagine our surprise when we were given the key to the neighbouring room as a complimentary upgrade because of our engagement! We had, in my opinion, the best room in the house and the staff had even gone to the trouble of scattering rose petals on the bed, covering two swans crafted from the white cotton towels provided, along with a wonderful note congratulating our engagement. We felt very special indeed.

Every single member of staff was incredibly attentive and would aim to please with such positive attitudes. The food was also of an exceptional standard and I feel truly lucky to have experienced such exquisite local delicacies. Breakfast was so good I took regular photographs of it and the cocktails in the evening were emphatically creative - the strawberry daiquiri was out of this world!

There's so much more I'd like to say about this wonderful place but I feel it would spoil the surprise to those who read this. You're just going to have to find out for yourselves!

I implore you to stay at The Headland Hotel. You certainly won't forget it.",Date of stay: June 2016,The Headland Hotel & Spa,4,"Newquay, United Kingdom"
Best in town,"Wow, what a place! Everything about this restaurant was fantastic. Our waitress was extremely friendly and knew exactly how to look after us. She knew everything there was to know about the food on the menu, the drinks on offer and the history of the building - and she'd only been working there a few months! Incredible!

I love places where you can see the open-plan kitchen, they make me feel as though the restaurant has nothing to hide. Not only that, the aromas wafting in our direction made me want to sample as much as humanly possible. Alas, I restrained myself and went for a delicious lamb pie with, what can only be described as, orgasmic chutney....yowsers, that stuff was addictive! I had to stop myself from buying a pot of it on the way out!

Drinks were crisp, tasty and the range was vast. Service was super-quick and delivered with a smile. The manager even took the time out of his busy routine to have a little chat with me before I high-fived the kitchen staff as my fiancee and I left the building. Awesome!

Pure decadence,"As part of a small group I visited this outstanding place of interest by way of recommendation from friends. It was only supposed to be a fleeting stop-off but I think I managed to have two drinks, a sample of the menu, bought an expensive bottle of (the most amazing) white wine and a brochure for the New Year's Eve party!

After a quick nosey tour of the bar and garden areas I was convinced I was having an incredibly luxurious experience, not just a place to dine and drink. One thing which really captivated me was the professionalism of the staff who quite obviously undergo an extensive training regime to reach such a high level of competence. I was in awe.

Fantastic food, fantastic drink, fantastic choice. I'm definitely retuning...the sooner the better.",Date of stay: August 2016,The Old Bridge,4,"Huntingdon, United Kingdom"
Love this pub,"This is one of my local pubs and by far my favourite. The staff are always friendly and helpful, the food is great if you're after hearty pub grub (I recently had steak and it was phenomenal, easily beating many of the cuts I've had in fine dining restaurants) and has one of the biggest beer gardens in Hitchin.

When I think of pubs to visit in the area which I can rely on for consistent satisfaction, The Moorhens is always one of the first that comes to mind. When the sun is out, it's even better and there's plenty of space to relax with friends. To be honest, any type of weather is the perfect excuse to call in.

I hope it always remains open and I for one will help to make sure The Moorhens is still here for years to come.",Date of visit: September 2016,The Three Moorhens,4,"Hitchin, United Kingdom"
Wooded wonderland,"One of my best friends just got married here and despite abysmal weather, the day couldn't have been more perfect.

Set back into the overgrown outskirts of Thetford forest, the ceremony took place in an emerald coloured enchanting setting. With plenty of trees for natural shelter from the rain and hay bales for people to sit on, the wedding was a picturesque delight of which every person enjoyed all day long.

The owners had pulled out all the stops to make it such a wonderful day for the happy couple and we all had a fab time. I can't say anything in terms of the actual house itself as most of the wedding party camped in tents and yurts on the farm's vast amount of land. However, waking up to lamas in the morning was definitely a 'first' for me and totally unique to my friend's wedding experience.

Simply wonderful.",Date of stay: September 2016,College Farm Bed & Breakfast,4,"Thompson, United Kingdom"
Great fun for all ages,"Woburn is the perfect setting for Go Ape to be utilised properly. Way above the ground level in the treetops there's so much to explore and everyone in our party had such fun, even those who aren't great with heights.

It's a full day of vertical fun, no matter how young or old you might be. With the proper safety training at the start you're good to go. It's very easy to manoeuvre your way around the course and the zip wires make it so much fun, especially as it was very foggy and you couldn't see the end of the rope - into the unknown!

I'd love to go back and I'm frantically searching for excuses to do so.

One of the nicest places I've ever stayed...,"Had an absolute blast in York! It's a fantastic city steeped in history and I've been recommending the place to everyone I've spoken to since I got back.

I'd just like to thank all of the staff at the Mount Royale Hotel for making our stay a relaxed and enjoyable one. The friendliness of the front reception staff as we checked in was a refreshing welcome after a long train journey and got us off to a great start to the long weekend. Throughout our stay the staff continued with a high level of professionalism and were always approachable. The chap at breakfast times was extremely helpful and gave us great tips for exploring the city. He, like everyone else, was happy to help in any way and was always upbeat with a big smile to make us feel welcomed. I very much hope the staff behind the scenes get the recognition they deserve as our room was impeccably clean and the entire hotel was maintained to an exceptionally high standard - we couldn't believe it was only a three star hotel!

Although I didn't sample the evening meals (already booked with other restaurants before the weekend break, I'm afraid) the breakfasts were amazingly delicious. I seldom get beaten by a mixed grill/full English breakfast but the Mount Royal Hotel defeated me! Not only that, it kept me going until dinner in the evening - literally! No wonder the have so many awards!

Next time we return to York (and we definitely will) we'll most certainly be staying with the Mount Royale Hotel again. Highly recommended.",Date of stay: May 2015,Mount Royale Hotel,4,"York, United Kingdom"
The perfect hotel in a heartwarming city,"The staff are so welcoming upon arrival of Hotel Jan Brito and they inform you everything on offer during your stay in Bruges. We were even given a booklet of vouchers too so that we could get a little extra back whilst seeing the sights. Having said that, we actually avoided being 'proper' tourists and just made it all up as we went along! However, if you're a hardcore tourist, there's plenty to see and do so you definitely won't be disappointed.

Once we were handed our room key we were guided to our room. It was a stunning standard double and was oozing 'history'! The bathroom was huge and the whole place was really cozy and warm. It was the most comfortable night's sleep I've had in a hotel for years! Super-clean too! I could go on and on but I don't want to bore people, haha!

In conclusion, Hotel Jan Brito gets top marks for cleanliness, friendliness, location to the main centre, value for money and sheer enjoyment! I've already recommended it to a friend who is soon to book a romantic stay in March.

"A friendly, welcoming pub which aims high","I've been to The Orange Tree less times than most pubs and restaurants in Hitchin but enough times to know it's a great pub to revisit again and again. I always recommend it to family and friends and I've just recently discovered their secret weapon; in the form of a Sunday roast beef!

The O.T is one of those versatile places which enigmatically suits to whatever kind of mood you're in. For example, I've been there with family for a casual meal...I've been for a birthday evening meal...a knees-up with friends...a cosy, intimate dinner for two. It just seems to cater for whatever night you're there for effortlessly.

The staff are very friendly, informative, polite and take the time to look after you. The drinks are always of a good standard and the food is better than your average pub grub. I don't think it quite compares to The Hermitage or The Radcliffe Arms but it certainly sets its goals high enough for you to enjoy a tasty bite to eat....at a great price!
