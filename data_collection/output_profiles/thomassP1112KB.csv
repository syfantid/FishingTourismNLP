A must do in Rhodos,"This was so much fun. We did a tour of the city by boat so we can take photos, and then we went fishing. There were so nice and helpful, felt like we were with friends. Then we went in a beautiful spot, they offered us drinks and cooked the fish we fished, it was delicious ! I higly recommend it to anyone, so worth it.
