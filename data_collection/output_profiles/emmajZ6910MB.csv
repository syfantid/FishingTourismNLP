Lovely location and character but you pay for it!,"We wanted a hotel close to a venue in the village and this was ideal. Very pretty building, lovely large room and a huge shower room but the windows were in a shocking state and filthy! I know old buildings can’t all have modern UPVC windows but they can still have the mould and mildew cleaned off them. Plus there were no window coverings at the bathroom so the shower was in direct view of the main road! I would certain consider staying here again but not at New Year - the cost was just too exorbitant for 1 night at nearly £300!!!",Date of stay: December 2019,Best Western Plus The Croft Hotel,1,"Croft-on-Tees, United Kingdom"
"Great food, fabulous environment","Visited on spec for a quick bite at lunchtime today and were really impressed with the food, the service and the whole experience. What a fabulous building and a unique experience for a lovely lunch. Well done everyone.",Date of experience: November 2019,Salt Beer Factory,1,"Saltaire, United Kingdom"
Should have eaten out,"I’d been recommend here but sadly it did not live up to the recommendation.

I should have guessed when the hotel brasserie was full and there was no one in here but went in anyway.

The food was nice, but not amazing. My husband found the chops very disappointing with little meat and more gristle and I think e both found the mains a little bland - both sauces tasted almost the same.

But the real kicker was the bill - a shared started, 2 mains and 2 drinks for over £90!! Ok, this included an ‘optional’ service charge. Very hard to ask for it to be removed once it’s in your bill though!

Although the food was pleasant I wouldn’t go back or recommend to anyone else.",Date of visit: September 2019,ERIKI Indian Restaurant At Crowne Plaza Hotel,1,"West Drayton, United Kingdom"
An expensive base but not much more,"Stayed for a couple of nights for a weekend away and chose this hotel as a base between Harry Potter world and Legoland and the location for this was great

The room was functional and clean but not much more - lacked a mirror over the desk to put on my makeup/dry my hair and I expected USB charging points in the room so the facilities were a little lacking.

The breakfast was very good, although expensive in my mind at £18 per person and we were incredibly disappointed with the on site Indian Restaurant where the food was pleasant but extremely expensive at over £92 for a shared starter, 2 mains and 2 drinks. I would recommend going out for dinner instead!!

So overall the hotel was let down by the overall cost of the stay. The room cost was over £170 for 2 nights, breakfast and dinner on top and parking at £16 a day too made this 2 night stay over £370 - too much for what we got really!",Date of stay: September 2019,Crowne Plaza Hotel London-Heathrow,1,"West Drayton, United Kingdom"
Great fun when you find your way around!,"We took this trip as a Birthday treat for my husband who is obsessed with Lego. We knew it would be busy with kids over a weekend but we’re actually unite impresses that it wasn’t too crowded.

The park is let down by lack of good directions and signposting and general information about rides and services. Even using the app it was difficult to find out where the rides were located and the types of rides available.

The rides themselves are not for true thrill seekers either, they were a little bit tame by usual Theme Park standards, clearly designed for younger children. Maybe Legoland need to re-think the age range of their clientele - were both 50!!

The highlight of the day was definitely the city structures in Mini Land - we spent a large portion of the day wandering around and admiring the incredible builds. This was what we’d really come to see and made my Lego-fan husband very happy.

Probably not somewhere we’d rush back to visit again but a good day out.",Date of experience: September 2019,LEGOLAND Windsor Resort,1,"Windsor, United Kingdom"
Amazing Day - no kids required!,"2nd visit, 6 years apart and loved every moment of the day. It was great to see the new exhibitions which were all presented to an astonishing standard.

There’s so much to see and do and the amount of interaction available is brilliant, for kids of all ages, including a couple of middle aged fans!

The organisation is brilliant, loads of helpful staff on hand with useful information and background, plenty of places to eat, drink and pee (always an important part of a trip!) and the prices weren’t too extortionate for eats and drinks.

Overall a brilliant day out and hopefully it won’t be another 6 years before we go again.",Date of experience: September 2019,Warner Bros. Studio Tour London - The Making of Harry Potter,1,"Leavesden, United Kingdom"
Lovely food and atmosphere,"This has become our go to place when we fancy a night out. We might not get out often but we know when we go here we can always rely on both the quality of the food and the incredibly attentive and genuinely friendly staff there.

There is a great choice of dishes on the menu and each tastes genuinely home made, fresh and authentic. I like hot curries but still want to taste the flavours of the food and not just the spice - I’ve never been disappointed here

It’s great to see a small local business thriving and so full of returning customers. Well done team, another fabulous meal and we will be back again soon.",Date of visit: August 2019,The Spiced Mango,1,"Wakefield, United Kingdom"
Beautiful location,"Yes, the queues are long, no, it’s not a long trip but who cares! It’s a stunning place to visit - like something out of a movie set!

The waters are unnaturally clear and beautiful, the boatmen are informative and funny as well as accommodating by taking photos for us and it’s well worth a visit.

Go early if you can to avoid the queues but go anyway and enjoy this natural wonder.",Date of experience: August 2019,Melissani Cave,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
An adventure for the little ones!,"An impressive underground cave with some excellent geological features but be prepared for a lot of steps!!

We had teenagers as well as a 3 year old with us and the little one managed the climb back up to the surface better than the rest of us!

It’s not somewhere you want to spend a long time visiting, not is it someone you would visit too many times but it’s definitely worth a trip.",Date of experience: August 2019,Drogarati Cave,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
My favourite place on the island,"Picturesque and traditional, this beautiful little village is a must see on any trip around the island - but plan to arrive early if you want to stand any chance of parking in the tiny car park!

Quaint little houses, lovely eateries overlooking the bay, pretty little swimming coves and a fabulous walk up to the castle at the top of the the rock. On our visit we also explored the abandoned development near the castle - just fascinating!

Only downside is the parking/access as the traditional Greek roads are very narrow and many visitors don’t have a clue how to drive in those conditions, creating gridlock in and out! But I wouldn’t change anything about the village - it’s a little gem x",Date of experience: August 2019,Assos,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Feel like one of the family,"What a fabulous place to lounge around and enjoy the sunshine! We used this pool most days during our stay and love the peaceful feel and beautiful surroundings.

The kids loved the pools and had a fabulous time but it wasn’t so overrun as to spoil the tranquility for the grown ups!

And what fab service at the bar, not to mention the fantastic, well priced food on offer.

Even if you’re not staying in the apartments take a visit for the day - so welcoming you’ll come away feeling like one of the family ️",Date of stay: August 2019,Efrosini Village,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Making memories.,"Without doubt this was the most memorable day of an already amazing holiday.

Efi and Demitrios made us all feel part of their family during our time on their boat. Nothing was too much trouble, they fed and watered us with the freshest possible ingredients (we had just taken the fish from the nets), watered us with their home made wine and answered every question as if it was the first time they’d been asked.

The locations we went to were incredible. I’ve never been swimming in water that colour before!

A very special day made even more special by the amazing crew. Thank you x",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Breakfasts to set you up for the day,"Had a great breakfast here with a great variety of choices on the menu. Good sized portions and great friendly service.

We also went for pre dinner cocktails - there’s a great choice available and they’re amazingly colourful and vibrant but there’s not a great deal of difference in how they all taste! Still, a great way to start the evening.",Date of visit: August 2019,Nemesis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Comfortable home from home,"We eat (and drink!) here regularly during our stays but this year Kostas, Georgia and Makis helped us put on a very special party for my husbands 50th birthday and I just can’t thank them enough. They couldn’t do enough for us, including sourcing an amazing birthday cake and keeping us supplied with food and drinks all night.
The food is always great, especially the fresh fish but a special favourite this year was the veal special with the spicy sauce - so good we had it on 2 separate occasions

Thank you all - we will be back!",Date of visit: August 2019,Lighthouse Taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Amazing food! Bring your appetite!,"Jerry and Maaike are so welcoming and friendly, providing a wide selection of varied, yet authenticity Greek cuisine, served to an exceptional standard. And I can’t review this place without mentioning Maaike’s incredible orange cake - whatever you eat from this fabulous menu, make sure you leave space for this (although you can get it to take out if you really don’t have room)!",Date of visit: July 2019,Jerry's Elliniko,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Perfect for us all,"Such a lovely place, warm seas and not too pebbly to walk into. Calm waters, especially at sunrise with easy access to the friendly local tavernas. Not too busy either, plenty of space to either sit on the beach, walk round to the pretty little harbour or just relax in with a cool drink.",Date of experience: August 2019,Katelios beach,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Won’t accept cards!,"If the policy of your establishment is that you don’t accept card payment that’s fine (although a bit backward and shortsighted in this day and age I think!). However it might be a really good idea to let your customers know before they eat!

Maybe a sign on the door to say Cash Only, a polite word from the wait staff as we were taken to our seats, an indication on the menus, anything would be sensible to let us know before we’d ordered.

Instead, after what really was a lovely meal (fabulous food with great flavours!) we were left in the embarrassing position of having no money to pay our bill!

My husband then had to make a mad dash across town to find a cash machine whilst I sat and waited in the bar as ‘collateral!

Don’t get me wrong, the staff were really nice about it, offering me a drink whilst I waited but it still made me feel a bit uncomfortable waiting for my hubby to return so we could pay the bill!

Overall an enjoyable evening but with improved communication at the beginning of the night we could have made better arrangements and enjoyed it even more.",Date of visit: April 2018,Omar Khans Restaurant,1,"Bradford, United Kingdom"
Great film experience but uncomfortable seats,"Hubby was desperate to The the new Avengers movie on the really really big screen! So I agreed we would visit the IMAX in Bradford rather than our usual Showcase at Batley.

Amazing visual and audio experience (although sitting too close to the front was a bad choice by us!) but the damn seats are so uncomfortable!

Both my husband and I are tall with long legs and I’m used to having all the space in the world with huge reclining seats so being squished into small, static seats with no leg room was a shock to the system

Enjoyed the film and hubby was in his element but I’d chose the comfy seats every time over the extra large screen.",Date of experience: April 2018,National Science and Media Museum,1,"Bradford, United Kingdom"
Not up to expectations,"When you order a dish off the menu that states ""Very Hot"" and lists ingredients including jalapeños and fresh chilli it should come as no surprise when customers are disappointed with a bland, flavourless dish containing none of the above with no kick whatsoever. When pointing out the failings of the dish to the waiter I was told No, it's only supposed to be a mild dish, and offered chilli oil to pour over it!

Even after taking it away to 'remake' the dish it was returned to me only 3 minutes later including chilli flakes for a little heat - hardly as described on the menu.

After asking, the cost of the dish was removed from the menu but sadly when I returned home I found I needed a swift trip to the smallest room in the house, and was woken by the same urgent need in the middle of the night leaving me wondering if my complaint about the food had left me with a parting gift from the Capri kitchen!

Although I was the only one of my party to raise a complaint we were all pretty disappointed with the food compared to our usual haunt so won't be returning. Shame really, I had high hopes.",Date of visit: September 2017,Capri Restaurant,1,"Wakefield, United Kingdom"
