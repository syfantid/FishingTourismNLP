Bästa lammet jag ätit,"Varit här innan, tre år sen, men denna gång var det ännu lite bättre. Jag åt lamracks som smälte i munnen och resten av sällskapet var oxå nöjda med sina rätter. De åt hamburgare och tonfisk.

Ett litet minus är priset, att inte något ingår till tonfisken och lammet. Fick lägga till side-dishes. Blir dyrt när man är många från en o samma familj.",Date of visit: August 2020,KOL & Cocktails,4,"Helsingborg, Sweden"

A great stay ....,".... both last year and this year.
The hotel is very close to Eggalm lift and even closer to the Tux-bus that drives every 10th minute to Hintertux glacier. We had breakfast and dinner included in our price. The food was good, a little better than average, no luxuary but very sufficiant and you can Always ask for more.
The staff is very helpful and kind. Good wi-fi.

The thing that brings our stay to a little minus is the heat in the rooms that you cannot control, so we had to sleep with the window open.

And a minus is cleaningsstaff... they cleaned well but knock on the door every morning before we were up. Not everyone wants to go up at 7 a.m to have breakfast and go skiing early.",Date of stay: February 2020,Hotel Pinzger Tux,4,"Tux, Austria"
