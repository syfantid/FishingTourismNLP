Overpromising but fairly priced,"Fishing experience is below average, boat is small and quite unstable, half of guests were feeling sick. Biggest fish we caught was 15cm, donâ€™t believe what you see in the pics. Most of the time we were catching tiny blowfish. Bright side is captain Mike who cooked an amazing lunch with fish they bring from the fish store... not even caught in Greece if I understood correctly. Overall good value for price but if you are looking for fishing experience, look elsewhere.",Date of experience: August 2019,Captain Manolis Fishing Trips in Rhodes,3,"Rhodes, Greece"
