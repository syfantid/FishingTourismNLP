Fabulous,What a little gem. The rooms are immaculate and Akis is very friendly. Everything you could possibly need has been provided for you. There is a roomy balcony with a lovely mountain back drop. Akis wife has done the rooms out very stylish yet comfortable and functional. Walking distance to restaurants an added bonus. We will return.,Date of stay: October 2019,The Seasons of Nickolas,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Wonderful experience.,"What a wonderful day we had venturing out on the fishing boat. We stopped and pulled in the nets that had been laid that morning. Whilst our food was being cooked we swam in the ocean near a beautiful secluded beach. Our food was some of the best I have ever eaten on this island and I have eaten lots of good food here. I tried a scorpion fish that we had caught which was very tasty. The seafood spegetti was awesome. Home made cake, wine and food along with the most welcoming family that run the trip. I will definitely recommend this day out and return next year. Tip take a snorkel you see lots of fish.",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
