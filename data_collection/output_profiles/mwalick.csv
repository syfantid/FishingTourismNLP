"Great food, incredible setting!","Stopped for lunch on our way out of town to head back home and it was such a great send off! We had our 2 dogs with us so we sat in the beer garden area which was perfect. Nice picnic tables provided shade and we had a great view of the marina. Because of the COVID safety measures in place, we had to order on the deck, pay and take a table number marker. A waitserver then brought us our food. Everything was very organized, the menus had been sanitized and the food was delicious. Highly recommend stopping in for a bite and a drink!",Date of visit: July 2020,Jake's On The Lake,4,"Tahoe City, California"
Awesome day on the river!,"We’ e always wanted to do the Truckee float and finally did it and wonder why what took us so long?! It was such an amazing day—my husband and 16yr old son absolutely loved it and we had the best 3 hour float. The logistics went down without a hitch from the shuttle to the site, to thr awesome staff giving us the rundown to the team who got us off the river—fabulous! We brought our cooler and enjoyed snacks and drinks on the way down as well as a plunge every now and then to cool off. Definitely recommend taking a cooler of at least water since the altitude and sun can be super dehydrating. The only thing missing were our dogs which we will definitely bring next time. Highly recommend this awesome time!",Date of experience: July 2020,Truckee River Raft Company,4,"Tahoe City, California"

INCREDIBLE!!,"This is an absolute must if you want something different, off-the-beaten-tourist-trap-path and to come away feeling like you lived like a local for a few hours. My husband, 15yr old son and I had a fabulous time and are still talking about it. The excursion only allows for 8-10 ppl maximum so you will experience a very personal, intimate and super informative excursion. There is no one on a loudspeaker nor are there earplugs—-you will feel as though you are simply going to work with the local fishermen for the day. Our beautiful captain Anthi was amazing and so knowledgeable having grown up on the island and learning the trade from her father. Our trip included swimming and snorkeling in the crystal clear sea, and then enjoying the most delicious and freshest catch along with grilled vegetables and bread I have ever tasted —grilled and prepared on board by Anthi, Marcus and Mohammed. The beer, wine and non-alcoholic drinks were unlimited. We had another couple on the trip with us and we enjoyed a few glasses of wine with them over lunch and getting to know them. I cannot recommend this enough!!!! —Melanie from California, USA",,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Incredible Tour!,"My husband, 15yr old son and I just did the Athens tour by night with our tour guide George and it was fabulous! George was the most accommodating, gracious and INCREDIBLY informative and knowledgeable guide. I learned more about Athens and Greek history in a few hours than I did in high school! He’s a terrific conversationalist so our tour felt like we were visiting with a relative, not a stranger. We covered SO much ground and because it was an evening tour, we avoided much of the crowd since we’re here at the height of tourist season. The van was comfortable and George navigated the traffic as though it didn’t exist. I highly, highly recommend this tour —particularly if you don’t have a lot of time but want to hit the highlights. The tour is not rushed by any means —it started at 5:30 and we were dropped off at a fun restaurant at 9:30—but you will see A LOT and have ample time at each site to get out and take photos, walk around, etc. George said he would have waited for us at the restaurant but I insisted he go home or join us! Lovely tour, great guide and all in all a must-do.",,Athens By Night Private Tour,4,"Athens, Greece"
