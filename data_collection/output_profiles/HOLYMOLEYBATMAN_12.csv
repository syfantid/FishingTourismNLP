Understaffed,"Great place, but understaffed, waited 45 minutes for breakfast, 40 minute wait for milk to be brought to room, an hour wait for pizza.
One of the pools should be adult only, too many screaming children.",Date of stay: August 2020,Il Borro Relais & Châteaux,1,"San Giustino Valdarno, Italy"
Excellent,"Although menu is relatively small, everything on it is appealing. The fish was very good and so fresh, service was attentive and the cost reasonable. Would recommend",Date of visit: February 2020,Cafe St Honore,1,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Thin walls,"The walls are so thin , stayed room 256 the guy next door turned tv on at 3.30 am and heard every word, also when he was talking on phone, he wasn’t particularly loud but the sound carried straight through wall, really disappointed. Couldn’t really complain either as can’t expect people to be silent but do expect better quality for the price u pay to stay here",Date of stay: February 2020,InterContinental Edinburgh The George,1,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"

No warning of nearby building work,"Exceptional service from all the staff really 5 star. Location is amazing, views stunning.
Lots of children on out visit with seamingly absent parents. There is an adult pool but much smaller than the one given over to the children.
There was a building site next door so instead of peace and quiet around there was the sounds of drilling,sawing and banging, with the sounds amplified by the surroundings mountains. No warning of this and no discounted prices. Beware ask if it’s still going on before you book!",Date of stay: July 2019,Belmond La Residencia,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Super,"Great food, plentiful with great service and entertainment. Shellfish is so tasty and fresh best Indian in Essex",Date of visit: June 2019,Royal Tiger,1,"Chelmsford, United Kingdom"
Great time,"Took my son and his friend along and watched the guys cast their nets, then we went to a deserted beach and swam ,amazing scenery, then they cooked freshly caught fish with best Greek salad,so much food with drinks, great guys to chat to and find out stuff, then we we pulled nets in to see the catch , lovely time would recommend",Date of experience: June 2019,Captain Nikolas,1,"Mykonos, Greece"
Continual annoying music,"First the positives, the place is spotless and very clean, the villa was pretty. The pool was clean but cold. You need a hire car unless you want to take buses, there are no pavements and the cars come pretty close.
The problem I had is with the constant music played out of a poor system. This starts in the morning and ends at 11pm. I asked for this to be turned down on several occasions, but if anything it was turned up!
I couldn’t relax with this tinny sound constantly on, it was in our room , on our patio, in our villa. Even when we were the only ones at pool they still refused to turn it down, it seemed to turn into a battle. We are paying guests,but it seems the staff wanted it on so on it stayed! I noticed that quite a few other people were wearing ear phones around the pool. No one else complained was the weary response, oh well that’s ok then. The other point is if you don’t get one of the six sunbeds in the shade you are forced to be without shade for the day.
In short one act of customer service would have resolved this but with their refusal to assist it ruined the stay and forced us to go elsewhere to relax",Date of stay: June 2019,Leonis Summer Houses,1,"Mykonos, Greece"
Magical (as long as you get table in rear),"Amazing decor , wine list is size of encyclopaedia and would take hours to read. Food was good service was good. Eat here twice, 2 different experiences, you must be seated in the back for a memorable experience.",Date of visit: April 2019,Clos Maggiore,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Average,"Great service. Scotch egg kedegree was tasteless, duck shepherds pie was so salty I had to drink 2 pints water. Daughter and mums plaice was watery and one had a hair in it. Dads steak was excellent and puddings were good hence bringing it up to average, but overall dissapointed except for the service and won’t be returning",Date of visit: April 2019,The One Bull,1,"Bury St. Edmunds, United Kingdom"
Like Eating in aircraft hanger,"Tables too close together , my chair was being kicked constantly by people waking by, cold and loud as metallic space. Paper table clothes , harden like furniture.
Food overpriced, squid was under cooked and tepid, spaghetti was under cooked ( not al dente). Red wine was cold as cellar wasn’t heated. Never again.
Service was very good though",Date of visit: January 2019,The River Cafe,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Building work nightmare,"Stayed with you atthe property 9-11th November. My girlfriend booked it for my 50th, we stayed on the lagoon villa 9. I wanted quiet (I'm autistic and certain noise irritates me beyond belief)

Unfortunately there was building work going on about 60 meters away on a new building. There was electric sawing ,banging and other noise,all day, we weren't able to sit out. Even when it went quiet I was on edge waiting for it to start again. We had to move to the beach, however I was disturbed by the constant music, There didn't seem anywhere I could just listen to the waves roll in without the distant bass of a song on the wind. I love music but when I choose to listen to it.

My girlfriend asked to change rooms as we were woken by the building noise again Saturday morning , although we were told the builders didn't start till 10. I can assure you I wasn't imagining the saw and banging at 8am!

We were moved to a 2 bedroom beach villa , although this was as close to the building work, the manager (Stuart Jones) then told us, after all our cases were moved that we would have to pay extra as it was a bigger villa!! We didn't exactly need an extra bedroom just some quiet. So we all moved back again. And a bottle of rum was left as an apology.

I agree with other posts about front desk, on checking out we found the receptionist quite rude, after asking us if we had taken anything from the mini bar and we said no, she got on the radio to ask for our room to be checked, she did this to other guests as well. What is the point of asking if you are going to refuse to believe . To stand there twiddling thumbs for 10 minutes (taxi waiting) while someone was despatched to our room to check, we felt like criminals in a line up !
To sum up , you should notify guests of building work, you know its going on, its very cheeky to ask for several hundred £'s a night and charge full price. To charge us after moving us because of something that is your fault isn't on and no way to run a hotel.
I sent an email to owner who referred us back to Stuart, he said front office had changed (obviously not after reading reviews) and offered us 1 free night off peak( of no use to us)
Poor customer relations, the manager should sort mistakes long before having to be told by owner.
When you are paying top dollar you expect the best, this resort failed.",Date of stay: November 2018,GoldenEye,1,Jamaica
Nice little place,"Attentive staff, very reasonable prices, great house red.
Nice presentation of food and well cooked.
Both had crab advacado to start , partner said slightly too lemony.
She had Brill for main which was an adventure as neither of us had had this fish before. Beautifully cooked great taste, I had beef Bourgogne, beef just fell apart and was very tasty.
Would recommend and will return.
Support independent restaurant or you’ll end up with a Prezzo there !!!",Date of visit: December 2018,Le Salon Prive,1,"Twickenham, United Kingdom"
Good and bad,"Starters very small and overpriced. We had all finished before one of our party had even got theirs. First choice wine not available, wine list very expensive for a pub, very little under £30.
Mains, lobster very small , all fish excellent .asked for accompaniments took 5 minutes leaving it to cool. Music too loud requested to turn down after 5 minutes Had to ask again. The fish made up for poor service and tiny starters, won’t rush back",Date of visit: June 2018,Long Melford Swan,1,"Long Melford, United Kingdom"
Good food,"Always get a good meal here, service is good, a bit noisy after the massive extension they've had , I liked it when it was a bit more intimate, would choose to go with crowd now rather than couple",Date of visit: March 2018,Magic Mushroom,1,"Billericay, United Kingdom"
Great meal,"Always welcome you like long lost friend , know your name after 2 visits, food is good and reasonably priced and a family vibe about he place, I like it here",Date of visit: March 2018,La Toscana,1,"Billericay, United Kingdom"
Excellent,"Best Beef wellington ever, shame it's not on the menu!!!! Someone had pre ordered , I saw it and there was one portion left, apparently pre order it when booking, starters of prawn/ lobster cocktail was very small but the best I've had, service was good overall a very pleasant evening",Date of visit: March 2018,Wiltons,1,"London, United Kingdom"
DONT BOOK,"Terrible waited 40 minutes at airport, then with a flight time of 7.45am they wanted to pick me up at 0240!!!! If you have a flight before 11am I wouldn't use them , they only tell you pick up time 24 hours before ,that way you cant cancel and get refund as they state you have to give them 48 hours, pay a little more and get a better service",Date of experience: October 2017,Suntransfers,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Tasting menu is a must,"They serve a tasting menu for 75 euros but there's about 14 dishes each s explained in detail and they give some great and different tastes, the décor is fab ,well worth a visit",Date of visit: October 2017,Fonda Espanya Restaurante,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Top notch,"Dinner here with my Italian girlfriend after we got back from Florence and its many eateries so stiff opposition!
She was worried as she wanted calves liver and hasn't found it done properly outside Italy, turned out it was the best she had ever had , I had seafood spaghetti which was great , the tomatoes normally surgery sweet were amazing really good little find will be sure to return",Date of visit: May 2017,La Toscana,1,"Billericay, United Kingdom"
One of the family,"What an amazing home, not often you get to live in a castle, The owners are so nice and helpful, they even lend you the dog ,when you go for a walk!!! The surrounding area is the most beautiful, so much to see and do on your doorstop. I would recommend this without hesitation.
Ask to join the family for dinner (at a cost) and if you're lucky they might let you try the homemade Lemoncello or walnut liquor all made from their garden as was almost all the food offered.",Date of stay: April 2017,Castello di San Fabiano,1,"Monteroni d'Arbia, Italy"
Informative and tasty,"Got shown around the Winery by the lovely Christina, she went through all the process of the wine making with some really interesting facts, and then finished off by sampling 6 bottles made all the better with each one being explained. And you don't have to spit it out!!!!",Date of experience: April 2017,Caparzo Winery,1,"Montalcino, Italy"
The Best,"Simply the best Pizza I've ever eat (but I am English). So good we went back during our short trip as the seafood spaghetti looked so good we didn't want to miss it, filled with locals so must be good,",Date of visit: April 2017,Il Pizzaiuolo,1,"Florence, Italy"

THE WORST DAY EVER,"Staying in Salou so thought I would take my children to the park. Was hearing horror stories about the queues in the heat during the days so went for the evening pass ,after 7 on a Monday evening. Once I had paid my 78 euros entered the park to find a notice board with the times of the wait to get on the rides. The good rides were 1.45 hour waits!!! The average rides were 1 hour and 45 mins for the mediocre ones. So back we went to buy express passes that mean you can get on much faster, oh hold on NO THEY DONT !!!shelled out another 70 odd euros, still waited under an hour to get on the good rides it is a joke , please don't go you will spend most of the day or night queuing it is a rip off never again.",Date of experience: August 2015,PortAventura,1,"Salou, Spain"
The good the bad and the ugly,"The good first. The food is excellent for a 3 star hotel, I have been on cruises that don't give you the quality of here. There is fish, meat cooked in front of you each night, big salad bar it really is very good. The hotel was very clean the rooms cleaned each day. The kids entertainment team work hard. The bad, takes ages to check in, the pool isn't big enough for the amount of people and the beds are hard with tiny pillow.. The ugly, part of the hotel is opposite a very large night club, this empty's out between 3 and 5 am you can hear the shouting, swearing ,fighting cars revving girls shrieking and I mean you can hear it all ,so if a light sleeper I suggest u go elsewhere.",Date of stay: August 2015,Ohtels Belvedere,1,"Salou, Spain"
Lovely Hotel,"Very warm welcome when we arrived , very informative about restaurants etc. Very clean hotel and rooms, beds sheets crisp and clean. Some nice personal touches in the room and around the hotel. Walking distance from BIC and front. Would recommend .",Date of stay: July 2015,Washington House Hotel,1,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom"
If its good enough for the locals.....,"Got taken here by a fellow police officer that showed us around Miami when my family and I visited at Xmas. Just superb, no wonder they are all porkers over there the food is superb. I had a pulled pork sandwich it was the best , but so big I mean really big. Everyone loved the food and as I say if the local police eat there your not gonna go far wrong",Date of visit: December 2014,Big Pink,1,"Miami Beach, Florida"
Is it me?,"Sorry just don't get it, family went here xmas to try the stone crab along with other sea food, given a wobbly table with a mind of its own.First we had 12 oysters they were dry and small, then the stone crab , for all the effort it takes to get out very little meat we all left hungry and its not cheap. The only bad meal we had during our stay.",Date of visit: December 2014,CJ's Crab Shack,1,"Miami Beach, Florida"
Best in Billericay,"Had a meal here Saturday night after a few beers, quite busy , but that's not a bad thing, be more worried if it was empty. Some unusual dishes which we tried and made a nice change. I take issue with the critic that called it appalling just because they felt rushed bit severe, anyway slight different menu to most so give it a try",Date of visit: December 2014,The Raj,1,"Billericay, United Kingdom"
Very Essexy,"Very cramped ,right on top of next table. Looks lovely from the outside, better than it does from within. Worth a visit to see all the Essex caricature's that visit. Food average",Date of visit: November 2014,The Shepherd and Dog,1,"Billericay, United Kingdom"
Frozen food from supermarket,"I see other reviewers are making the same comments I am about to make.
The food is frozen supermarket food that has been heated/deep fried etc. 4 of us ate there 3 had squid, is was awful, dripping in oil the batter was tasteless and the squid stringy My son had chicken nuggets ,again deep fried from supermarket, dripping in fat. I had ribs and yet again they have come from a packet from the supermarket. How they have been allowed to get away with this I'll never know? My daughter had lasagne which had been microwaved to within an inch of its life. Wife had half roast chicken which was ok. service was good, not the waiters fault, so I paid and left, very poor lots of other better places that make food on premises instead of buying from supermarkets and heating , AVOID",Date of visit: August 2014,Portofino,1,"Majorca, Spain"
GOODTIME,"Just stayed a week here. Very clean, good children's entertainment, rooms a good size. Would recommend the Chinese buffet on right towards beach on the main drag 6.95 euro for a s much as you want and it had crispy duck etc ,Excellent value. The beach and water is the best I have seen in the Med.",Date of stay: August 2014,Sol de Alcudia Apartments,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Nice find,"A good standard curry in a nice setting by the canal. Service good, food tasty, would recommend. They cater for children if they want something plain.",Date of visit: August 2014,Maharaj,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Worth a go,"Went for Sunday lunch, service was very good. Smoked King prawns for starters , as the waitress pointed out they were not king ,so little bit disappointed. I had roast beef ,very good and the gravy excellent, wife had haddock and chips with mushy peas and enjoyed it, with a shared passion fruit crème brulee to finish, all in all decent food and good service at reasonable price in nice surrounding's ,give it a go.",Date of visit: April 2014,The Angel,1,"Sudbury, United Kingdom"
Very Essexy,"Shown to table no fuss, not sure if it was busy as faced the wall all night, Razor clams for starters massacred in garlic, Wife had Japanese prawns said they were nice. Had monkfish for main, again soaked in sauce and the portion was so small in 3 fork falls and it was gone! Wife had dover sole which was tasty and of good size. If the fish is fresh the taste will speak for itself you don't need to cover it in sauce. The dish comes without anything, everything is extra. Chips taste like oven chips, but the spinach was excellent. The service was very good, but as its over £50 per head without drink food should be better and bigger.",Date of visit: April 2014,Alec's Restaurant,1,"Brentwood, United Kingdom"
