Super!,"Had a wonderful day out at sea.
3km of nets where wheeled in with plenty of fish, kalamari and other sea creatures.
Kids loved it also very much (boys aged 6 and 8) and where hands-on fish and nets all day plus plenty of swimming and snorkling:)

Also food made from the catch was superb!
Fun day full of experiences for all ages :)
Want to just go again.

Lovely!,"Super place to vist with family.
Kid`s loved the deep pool, playground and the grounds in general.
For parents also the pool is superb. Nice, deep and clean.

Lovely,"Went with family in june 2015 and loved it!

Very deep and clean pool, kids (and I) loved it, also best restaurants were in the walking distance, also a a minimarket. Walk to the beach was about 7-8 minutes, nice walk.
Clean, spacious and good wifi, overall good place to be.
Only thing I'd like to add is a full size fridge",Date of stay: June 2015,Villa Life,4,"Crete, Greece"

Hard to find a parking space,",Date of experience: June 2015,Municipal Market of Chani,4,"Crete, Greece"
