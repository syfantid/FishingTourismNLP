"If you visit Jordan, you must visit Petra","This is a place to visit at least once in a lifetime.
Avoid the hot summer period.
You can also take a horse ride, will take you further for one kilometer.
If you don't want to walk all the way down to main site, you can also take a horse carriage (for two persons). You can take a one way ride (20JDs) but better agree for two way ride when you take it (40JDs), otherwise the carriage drivers will ask you 30JDs to bring you back.

The whole scenery is amazing, but be careful of running horse carriages the carriage drivers are not careful enough. Also be careful of where you go, when you enter the main area, some of the places to climb are not very safe and there is no protection.",Date of experience: April 2019,Petra,1,"Petra - Wadi Musa, Jordan"

Enormous portions,"Vale Vale offers a variety if pub-style food. Portions are large and the food is very good.
Staff is very polite and with a nice smile.",Date of visit: August 2018,Vale Vale,1,"Argyroupoli, Greece"
Very average,"A single is very small, the bed is also very small.
If you leave your luggage on floor next to bed, basically no corridor is left next to the room.
Room really needed maintenance. Light switch was ripped off the wall, and this is a Health and Safety issue. The fire alarm on room ceiling was also ripped off and was hanging by the wires. One of the two lights in toilet was not working, nobody fixed it during my stay. Shampoo and Soap are provided though a large wall mounted box which is not very clean as all guests touch the boxes to extract shampoo and soap.
Breakfast was very limited, only the coffee was ok.
Persons at reception were nice and friendly but this is not enough to change the hotel's amenities.
Hotel lobby is very small and hotel's door entrance is not representing of a three star hotel.
Room sound insulation is poor, you can hear the persons staying at the next rooms.
Room rates are very expensive for what is offered.",Date of stay: September 2018,Hotel Victorie,1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"

Really worth visiting.",Date of visit: August 2018,Agora Restaurant-Bar,1,"Athens, Greece"
Perfect for an organized event,"Dionysos Zonar's is a perfect place to organize a company or family event.
Food is excellent, staff is professional and knowledgeable and location can not get better than this.
Offers plenty of parking and direct view of the Acropolis.

Seems to be pricey, but for important family or company events it is worth it.",Date of visit: July 2018,Dionysos Zonar's,1,"Athens, Greece"
Value for money and clean,"The hotel is clean, the staff are helpful and breakfast is reasonable.Price is good, but be aware that walking to Verona historic city center is not easy, especially in the summer.
Walking can take 20 - 30 minutes.
The hotel offers a free shuttle during the day time, to return to the hotel you need to get a taxi (around Euro 11) or pay to use the hotel's shuttle service.
You can always find a taxi to return to the hotel at night.
If you don't mind the taxi and shuttle travel to the city center, the hotel is worth visiting, but if you prefer to be within walking distance of the historic center, the hotel is too far.",Date of stay: August 2018,Hotel San Pietro,1,"Verona, Italy"
Excellent way to see Verona's Historic Centre,"Segway Verona Tour is an excellent way to visit the Verona Historic Centre.

I highly recommend doing this tour.",Date of experience: August 2018,Segway Verona Tour,1,"Verona, Italy"
Different than other theme parts,"Movieland is worth visiting, make sure you have a change of cloths because you will probably get very wet.
It is an enjoyable visit, with family and you can spend the entire day there.",Date of experience: August 2018,Movieland Park,1,"Lazise, Italy"
Very nice hotel and location,"The hotel is very nice, with good facilities and very helpful staff.
Enormous breakfast. Also worth swimming in the lake but better wear snickers to protect your feet from the rocks.

Everything was perfect until it rained in the afternoon and bad weather continued for a few hours.
The hotel guests stayed at the hotel and went to the hotel restaurant for dinner.
There was only one waiter in the restaurant, who was really trying his best to cope with the hungry guests of the entire hotel! The waiter was a real hero, trying to do the impossible.
Many guests left during the rain to go to other restaurants in the city.

It would be better if the hotel management checked the weather and if bad weather is expected to have more shift at the hotel to serve the guests.",Date of stay: July 2018,NH Lecco Pontevecchio,1,"Lecco, Italy"
Very impressive,"Doge's Palace is a must-see when you visit Venice.
It represents the history of Venice throughout many centuries.
I would highly recommend taking a guided tour to visit the palace.

There is so much information that you need a guide to tell all this.

You will enjoy the internal decorations which are very valuable and beautiful, also make sure you visit the prison adjacent to the palace.

If you just buy an entrance ticket you will have to wait in line for a long time and there is no tour guide to provide the information.",Date of experience: July 2018,Doge's Palace,1,"Venice, Italy"
Worth visiting if you have time to wait,"The menu was the standard Hard Rock Café menu.
Burgers and spare ribs are really nice!
Only issue is that the place is so busy you usually have to wait more than 30 minutes in order to get a table.
The food and the staff were great, especially George!",Date of visit: July 2018,Hard Rock Cafe,1,"Venice, Italy"
Disappointed,"I have visited a few times the place, the food is reasonable quality and the staff is polite and know their job.
However, I think I will never visit again for the following three serious problems:
* expensive for what you get
* limited menu (I am tired of eating the same dishes)
* Very limited toilet facilities - this is a serious deficiency.
Actually I wonder how this place got a permit to operate. I asked the staff and they told me the toilets are upstairs and there are no other toilets.
There is only one toilet for men and only one for ladies.
Rarely I see a line for men's toilet at a restaurant, at this place you can see a line.
And there is no area just to wash hands. If you want to wash your hands, you have to wait in line at the overbusy toilet which is not very clean because people and children are lining up waiting for their turn.
Just for this reason I am dissapointed for Hard Rock Cafe in Athens.",Date of visit: July 2018,Hard Rock Cafe,1,"Athens, Greece"
Very nice place and views,"The view is very nice during the day or at night time.
Nice and cozy environment, friendly staff and nice drinks.

Best pizza in Cyprus,"If you like to taste the original Napoli pizza, with ingredients imported from Italy, this is the place. Pizza is freshly made, in a wood oven, the taste is perfect and is very appetizing. This is a must-try place.

Very good service and management.",Date of visit: March 2018,Pizzeria Napoletana 485,1,"Larnaca, Cyprus"
Very nice hotel,"The hotel is luxurious, just next to a large shopping center.
Location is also very nice.

Hotel meals are a bit pricy, especially the steak restaurant.
Roof top pool offers a very nice view of Abu Dhabi.",Date of stay: March 2018,Four Seasons Hotel Abu Dhabi at Al Maryah Island,1,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"
Very good restaurant but pricey,"The food was excellent, and the service was very good.
However, considering the prices, I would expect more than what I got.
The prices are prohibitive for a family to visit.",Date of visit: March 2018,Butcher & Still,1,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"
"Very convenient, near the airport, very good service","The hotel location is very convenient to the airport, staff is very friendly and efficient.

The meze dishes they offer are nice and tasty.
Also ask if they have any other local delicasy dish available.",Date of visit: November 2017,Vlachos Tavern,1,"Larnaca, Cyprus"
Pitty,"Don't be fooled by the beautifully restored traditional villa.
Just concentrate on the food and you will be disappointed.

This restaurant has opened only 1-2 months ago, so the management is still trying to put everything together, I really hope that they will address the problems and find the appropriate solutions.

Main issues identified:
> Hostess was not dressed appropriately (jean and athletic shoes), her behavior was good
> Very long time to wait after we were seated, not even to bring drinks in the hot summer
> large powerful floor standing fans blowing intensively air to the tables, there are better ways to cool external areas (ie using moisture fans)
> All the waiters were inexperienced (except one waiter). Management should train the waiters and hire also more experienced waiters
> The waiters did not know the menu (for example they could not tell us the difference between the offered Greek and the Cyprus salad)
> Our order was not exactly what we ordered
> We did not ask for onion on our order, but this request was ignored
> We asked for a waiter to come to order drinks, he nodded ""yes"" but disappeared for another five minutes
> Food was not nice, for example lamp chops were not cooked on charcoal and lamp cooked in waxed paper was almost burnt
> In general food was tasteless and very touristic tasting
> The fruit that was served at the end of dinner (sweet melon and watermelon) was not fresh at all and seemed to have been cut many hours ago and left in the kitchen

Plus points: the served food portions are plenty, but this is not enough to justify an enjoyable visit, hopefully they can improve because the restaurant has great potential if properly staffed and managed",Date of visit: September 2017,To Arxontikon,1,"Larnaca, Cyprus"
No Lamb Souvla?,"Excellent distant view of the unspoiled area and the sea.
Good chicken and pork souvla, fried potatoes cut in half and nice salad.
Very limited menu and I was disappointed not to have lamb souvla.
If you don't mind the lack of lamb, you will enjoy the restaurant and the food.
Traditional garden restaurant with nice shade and cool breeze.
There is a dirt road for a few kilometers, reasonable condition, but when it rains it may be difficult for someone who doesn't use a 4x4.",Date of visit: September 2017,Viklari Peyia,1,"Peyia, Cyprus"
Spectacular view of the sea,"Dipato Restaurant at Perivolia offers one of the most amazing restaurant views in Cyprus! The food is very good and the service is also very at high levels.

"Excellent product, very poor service","Haagen-Dazs serve very nice ice cream.
But, every time I visit, the waitress tak8ng the order has no smile. It seems that she is really underpaid, overworked, or just not interested.
Maybe higher management should look into this, when one offers the one of the best icecream in town, a nice welcome smile would make all the difference!",Date of visit: June 2017,Häagen-Dazs,1,"Larnaca, Cyprus"
Very nice decor and food,"The food was very nice and the service was excellent and prompt.

Value for money and clean,"The hotel is conveniently located near Thessaloniki Airport.

Good choice for a company Conference,"The hotel is suitable for company conferences or seminars and can accommodate more than two hundred persons. Has many available rooms to hold simultaneous meetings and presentations.
The cleaning and waitering staff are the biggest asset of the hotel, always polite and helpful.
Some issues with regards to proper organizing the staff or an event and with level of cleanliness in bathtubs. Also bathtubs have shower curtains instead of glass doors and the feel is not comfortable when you take a shower.
Nothing near the hotel to walk to, you will need a taxi to visit other places near the hotel.
Breakfast does not have a large variety. Cheeses are not offered, if one wishes to have cheese with his breakfast he/she has to order it from a waiter which may be time consuming. The plus of breakfast time is the large coffee machine which prepares various types of excellent coffee.",Date of stay: May 2017,Chesford Grange - A QHotel,1,"Kenilworth, United Kingdom"
Excellent way to see Paris,"Retro tours is an excellent way to see Paris iconic sites and traditional buildings that can not be visited by bus tours.
Can go with a friend or as a couple. Our motorcycle driver was polite, knowledgeable, interesting to listen and professional. There are more drivers stationed at different key locations and (I think) four different tours are offered, depending on your preference and your past experience.

Impressive waters but not sure if it is really worth visiting,"When we reached the exit, there was a sign saying that the dirt road was suitable for cars. The sign was wrong, the dirt road was suitable for helicopters. Don't use your own car to get there, the road was very bad at some parts of it, and there were sharp stones on the road causing possible damage to the car tires.
When we reached the place, after driving on the dirt road for a few endless kilometers, we had to pay 6 euros per person including the kids.
The owner was very friendly and provided a nice overview of the history of the place.
The waterfalls pond has beautiful and very cold blue water, the surrounding area was average with regards to cleanliness. You may visit once out of curiosity, but you will probably not visit again.",Date of experience: July 2016,Adonis Baths Water Falls,1,"Paphos, Cyprus"
