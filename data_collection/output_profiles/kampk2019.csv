Best Day In Greece!!!,"Our hotel owner suggested Flora when we said we wanted a boat day. We considered a Catamaran but thankfully he talked us out of it and told us about antonio and his father. It was a day we'll cherish for the rest of our lives and watching the tourist boats packed with unsatisfied travelers passing by us was classic. They all wished they were experiencing our voyage. This is a MUST and plan on laughing, singing, dining, swimming, exploring, dancing, the list goes on....we miss those guys!!!",Date of experience: August 2019,Flora Fishing Tours,5,"Santorini, Greece"
