Best Day Ever,"We had the most amazing day from start to finish. I have been on many boat trips and this was by far the best ever. We caught over 60 fish between us, my 6 year old daughter even caught 8 fish, it was amazing to see the joy on her face. My 10 year old daughter caught the biggest fish. Nancy and Yanis made us feel so welcome, Nancy cooked the fish and prepared a beautiful Greek salad with lovely bread and home grown olives, and not forgetting the lovely Samos wine. What an amazing day with my family, the memories we will cherish forever. Thank you so much Nancy and Yanis, Yamas",Date of experience: July 2019,Samos Fishing Trips,5,"Samos, Greece"
