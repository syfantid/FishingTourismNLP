Holiday,"We couldn’t have had a better holiday! Nikos and his family were wonderful and couldn’t do enough for you. Everything from the food, drink, the maids cleaning the room virtually daily, the swimming pool which was lovely and kept immaculate and some of the great people we met. The apartments are in a great location and just a short walk to the beach and restaurants and bars. We hope to come back very soon and thank you Nikos for your great hospitality and making our holiday so special, what a lovely man! Look forward to seeing you all again in the future Sarah, Andy, Harry & George.",Date of stay: June 2018,Eryphilli,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Fresh fish all cooked whilst you can go for a swim in the crystal waters, then sit back on the boat to eat together with home made wine!
