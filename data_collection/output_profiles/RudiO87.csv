Pleasant stay.,"The WiFi was very poor in our room. Had to go onto the balcony for reception which was still rather poor.
Staff very friendly. Pull out sofa bed for kids was very uncomfortable.
Our room was overlooking one of the terraces which was noisy at night with live music and noise from guests having a late night drink.
Just needed to vacuum the floors otherwise the rooms were cleaned really well.
Non the less our stay was a pleasant one. I would still recommend this hotel particularly for its location and itâ€™s varied restaurants.",Date of stay: October 2019,Ramla Bay Resort,4,"Island of Malta, Malta"
