Outstanding service,"A great hotel with really comfortable rooms, decent car park and amazing staff. Especially would like to mention Jodie who went above and beyond the call of duty to arrange local cabs to the festival we were performing at and to Nicola who served us in the bar, nothing was too much trouble and I cannot recommend this place highly enough",Date of stay: August 2019,Mercure Wolverhampton Goldthorn Hotel,5,"Wolverhampton, United Kingdom"
Brilliant,"This is the life, totally chilled out crew, advice for those new to fishing and free food and drinks. You can swim in the sea and you're pretty much guaranteed to catch fish. The fresh barbequed Dorado was absolutely delicious, sure there are other fishing trips, but the crew make it for me, highly recommended.",Date of experience: August 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
