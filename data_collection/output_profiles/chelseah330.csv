"Brilliant day out, one to experience!","Having read the reviews already, I had a good idea we’d have a great day, and we wasn’t disappointed! The captain and the lady (I’m sorry I can’t remember names!) we’re fantastic hosts, the hospitality was great, all drinks were included with plenty of choice. The views were wonderful and plenty of photo opportunities with a relaxed atmosphere, even in these troubling times.
We fished for just over an hour and everyone and then went snorkelling in the caves and came back to fresh fish and Greek salad with watermelon for dessert.
We will definitely be visiting the island again and certainly will be booking another Makarounas trip! Look forward to seeing you again.",Date of experience: September 2020,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
