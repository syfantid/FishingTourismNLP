Greek hospitality,"One of the most unexpected experience than I ever had. These team , mr Captain Kyriakos and his daughter ,makes me feel the Greek hospitality. The trip was amazing, we swam in places with crystal waters evev if you could imagine. Last but not least is the experience that we had with the fishing on board. Mr Kyriakos did the unexpected made us to feel like we are expert in this. I love more Milos than before after this excursion. If I will visit Milos in the future, i will be sure that i will make it again.",Date of experience: August 2020,Milos Fishing Trip,5,"Milos, Greece"
