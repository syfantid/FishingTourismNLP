Delicious!,"Went here late one evening with my husband and was delighted to find they were still serving food. Hadn't done my research so wasn't sure what to expect, but I have to say the food was amazing! Portions were very big, but it wasn't a case of quantity over quality, the fish was so so good. Friendly staff also. Highly recommend.",Date of visit: September 2019,Ol' Bastard's,4,"Lagos, Portugal"
"Nice views, amazing food","My friend and I had the most wonderful dinner here together. We watched the sunset from the roof enjoying a few glasses of Sula. The staff were great, attentive but not over the top. The food was amazing, I recommend the black dhal! Will definitely visit again.",Date of visit: July 2019,Dagla - The Rooftop,4,"Jaipur, India"
Great variety and service,"I visited OM Sai to browse but ended up with a few nice things including a tailored shirt for my husband. Very reasonably priced and they can make bespoke clothing for you an drop to your hotel next day. They make in house and work with women in local villages. Good to shop or just for a browse, chilled atmosphere no pressure. Would highly recommend.",Date of experience: July 2019,Om Sai Textiles,4,"Jaipur, India"
Very relaxing couples massage,"My husband and I had a very relaxing couples massage here. We felt very looked after and our massages were awesome(I had an aromatherapy massage and my husband had a deep tissue massage). We also had a steam bath after which was wonderful, definitely a good way to detox and sweat out the post-Christmas alcohol etc! The staff were lovely and we were not rushed at all like we have been in some spas previously. Would highly recommend.",Date of experience: January 2019,Secret Root Spa,4,"Mirissa, Sri Lanka"
Excellent value for delicious lunch,"My husband and I had an awesome lunch here. Very fresh roti and kothu, I also recommend the peanut butter milkshake! The food was excellent and extremely well priced, definitely a lower price than you would pay nearer to the beach and much tastier! I have take off one star for the bathroom though. You don't expect much from public / restaurant bathrooms in Sri Lanka in general but this was a little below par!",Date of visit: December 2018,Dewmini Roti Shop,4,"Mirissa, Sri Lanka"
Best meal in Mirissa,"My husband and I had an amazing meal here. We got to choose our fish when we arrived (chicken fish and red snapper). Both were cooked to perfection by a master grill cook who couldn't be much older than a teenager but did a superb job, it was mesmerising to watch. The whole meal was awesome and the place had a fun and friendly atmosphere. Very good price too! The only turn off was the very loud music (I'm not usually put off by this kind of thing but it was heavy techno!) but I almost didn't notice I was enjoying my meal so much. Highly recommend.",Date of visit: December 2018,Roti Shop Mirissa,4,"Mirissa, Sri Lanka"
Best place we stayed in Sri Lanka,"My husband and I absolutely loved our stay at Morning Star in Mirissa. This is a family run business and they made us feel at home instantly. Our room was everything we wanted it to be - we even loved the artwork so much we bought it from the owner and brought it home to London. The location was perfect, so close to the beach and local restaurants and bars. We also loved just chilling by the pool and the breakfast was awesome! Definitely 5 stars from us!",Date of stay: December 2018,Morning Star,4,"Mirissa, Sri Lanka"
"Stunning place, beautiful horses and lovely people","My husband and I took an evening ride through the scenic trails around Elpida ranch. We are absolute beginners and Elpida made us feel very at ease! The ranch itself is beautiful, and the horses are well looked after and loved. Elpida and her husband were very friendly, we even shared a beer with them afterwards! Would highly recommend, we had an amazing time and it was very reasonably priced!",Date of experience: September 2018,A&E Elpida Ranch,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
"Amazing trip, a must do in Rhodes","Really great half day out! Nice cruise around the bay then we stopped to fish. Everyone caught something, it was quite exciting! The tour guide saw I was struggling at first so he gave me lots of help until I got the hang of it! Then we hopped out of the boat for a snorkel while the tour guides cooked us up an amazing fish lunch, including some of the fish we caught! Highly recommend, definitely worth doing!",Date of experience: August 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Totally fine!,Fine hotel in good location. Rooms and decor a bit dated but it was clean and the beds were comfy. Food in the grill downstairs was better than I expected but the breakfast was very average. Friendly staff. Pool area/facilities very basic.,Date of stay: October 2017,Best Western Plus Ticonderoga Inn & Suites,4,"Ticonderoga, New York"
Interesting and interactive historical sight,"I visited Fort Ticonderoga on a family road trip. Beautiful scenery and interesting museum. I'm not into my military history but it was still enjoyable. The re-enactors were good and you can see them cooking in a pit and firing a canon. Overall, a fun afternoon out with family and suitable for kids. We didn't do the official tour as we didn't have time, but it was included in the entry price and looked very engaging.",Date of experience: October 2017,Fort Ticonderoga,4,"Ticonderoga, New York"
Nice place if you like that sort of thing,"Stayed here with my fiance and my parents on a road trip through New England. I'm not a huge fan of B&Bs but I this place was nice enough. Way too many nick nacks etc. for my liking, but our room nice. We had a fire and the bed was very comfortable. The steam shower was a nice bonus.The inn keeper is a little off... Not unfriendly, just a bit gruff, I don't think we shared the same sense of humour! Good location, Chester is a nice town, with good local restaurant and pub, but you probably wouldn't stay more than one night. I would recommend this place if you like a B&B experience a bit on the 'twee' side.",Date of stay: October 2017,Chester House Inn,4,"Chester, Vermont"
Surprisingly excellent food for a small town eatery!,"Went here for a family dinner while on a road trip through New England. We had excellent meals all round and nice wine. Pleasant, enjoyable atmosphere, not trying to be something it's not, just a normal looking place with surprisingly tasty food! Very helpful and accommodating staff. Would highly recommend, worth travelling to if you're not staying in Chester.",Date of visit: October 2017,The Free Range,4,"Chester, Vermont"
"Delicious, you can taste the history!","Real, authentic New York deli. Ordering is a little complicated, but the staff are friendly. The sandwiches are pricey but so worth it! Order the pastrami, have never had a sandwich so good!",Date of visit: October 2017,Katz's Deli,4,"New York City, New York"
Nice atmosphere with affordable eats!,"I went here with my partner after walking the Highline. We got there around 6pm and the restaurant was quite empty but it very quickly filled up. Doesn't look oveky impressive from the outside, but give it a chance! Decor is minimalist and there is a nice atmosphere, low lighting, candles etc. with good music. Very friendly and helpful staff. We both ordered pizzas which were absolutely delicious. Lovely authentic, crispy thin Italian base, not the greasy deep pan you expect in New York! Highly recommend for low- key, casual, good value dining.",Date of visit: October 2017,Company,4,"New York City, New York"
Stunning views but let down slightly by the staff,"My partner and I visited the Top of the Rock on the first morning of our trip to New York. We didn't book ahead as we weren't sure what time we would get there for. We went in to buy tickets and were barked at by a very rude member of staff in the ticket area when we asked for help. It wasn't just us, she seemed to be very rude to everyone. Not the welcome we had hoped for, but undeterred we bought our tickets. The next available time slot wasn't for an hour an a half so we went for a walk around Central Park and came back. The elevator to the top is really cool, you can see through the glass roof as you ascend. The views are amazing and I would recommend Top of the Rock over the Empire State Building as there a shorter wait times and you actually get to see and appreciate the Empire State building rather than being on it. The rest of the staff we encountered were friendly, but it was let down by that one person. I also felt that it wasn't very well sign posted. You get in off the street and you are in a maze of a shopping plaza and it is hard to find where you need to go. But apart from that, it was a very enjoyable experience and I would recommend it, especially if you have good weather.",Date of experience: October 2017,Top of the Rock,4,"New York City, New York"
"Enjoyable tour, even if you're not a baseball fan!","My partner and I took the Fenway Park Tour in October. We booked the 5pm tour, which was the last tour of the day and was really lovely as we got to see the stadium as the sun was setting. Our tour guide was friendly, entertaining as was very good at answering questions the other tourists had. The stadium itself is beautiful and steeped in history. I learnt a lot on the tour, and enjoyed hearing all the bits of trivia even though I'm not much of a sports fan! The only tip I would give is if you take the 5pm tour, visit the merchandise shop beforehand as it will be closed by the time you finish up! We found this out the hard way and missed out on getting our baseball caps!",Date of experience: October 2017,Fenway Park,4,"Boston, Massachusetts"
Fantastic seafood and excellent service,"I went here for dinner with my partner. We are both big seafood fans and we were not disappointed! We had fresh oysters and clams to start which were amazing. I ordered the lobster roll for my main which I highly recommend, it was so delicious, though I probably could've eaten two! My partner had the clam bake which came with lots of clams, mussels and a whole lobster. He made a bit of a mess but he thoroughly enjoyed it! The staff were extremely friendly and attentive. I would highly recommend a dinner at Summer Shack, I'd go again in a heartbeat if I visit Boston in the future. Oh, and the cocktails were really good! I ordered an espresso martini even though it wasn't on the menu and it was awesome!",Date of visit: October 2017,Summer Shack,4,"Boston, Massachusetts"
Mesmerising Glass Flowers,"I visited the museum to see the Blaschka Glass Flower exhibition. They were absolutely gorgeous and spectacular, the craftsmanship is stunning and difficult to comprehend at times (how did they do it!? And over one hundred years ago!? Amazing!) I could have spent longer in the museum but I didn't have time. Very good value, would recommend, but maybe not if flowers aren't your thing. My partner was less interested than I, he said once you'd seen one flower you'd seen them all!",Date of experience: October 2017,Harvard Museum of Natural History,4,"Cambridge, Massachusetts"
Great for a few drinks and a dance!,"My partner and I went here for a few drinks after dinner. We are both Irish so we usually avoid Irish pubs like the plague when we are abroad, but we thought in Boston it would be rude not to try at least one! It was pretty authentic on the inside, a selection of Irish music memorabilia line the walls. It was a Friday night and we paid $5 in which seems like nothing seeing as we got a whole night of live music and dancing out of it! A live band came on at about 10.30 and they were surprisingly good for a house band. They played a lot of covers and cheesy 80s rock but they had everyone up dancing and the atmosphere was great. The drinks weren't too pricey and the service was fast. The Guinness was decent too which is a rare find anywhere out of Ireland or the UK. Overall I was very impressed, it's a cut above the usual Irish pubs!",Date of visit: October 2017,The Burren,4,"Somerville, Massachusetts"
Awesome pancakes and cornbread,"Stumbled upon this little gem one morning on a recent trip to NYC. It looked clean and quite busy so we decided to give it a try and we were not disappointed! We had lovely omelettes, not greasy like you usually find in the city. The cornbread was some of the best I've ever had and so were the pancakes. It's a no frills kind of place but the staff were friendly and efficient, the food was great and so was the coffee, what more could you want!?",Date of visit: October 2017,Yura's Blue Plate,4,"New York City, New York"
For a different view of the city,"My fiance and I had a very pleasant walk along the Highline from the harbour/pier area to the Village. Really nice way to see the city, not quite above it, but in amongst it, getting views into people's windows and patios etc. The pathway is well maintained with small gardens, artworks and information points along the way. A nice route to take if you find yourself in that part of the city.",Date of experience: October 2017,The High Line,4,"New York City, New York"
"Good food, nice atmosphere but overpriced","My partner and I booked dinner here on our first Saturday night in New York. We ordered oysters, duck salad and the wings and shared. It was all pretty good, especially the salad, but quite small portions. The atmosphere was very enjoyable but we felt it was expensive for what it was.",Date of visit: October 2017,Ducks Eatery,4,"New York City, New York"
Laid back bike ride,"My fiance and I took the Brooklyn bike tour on a sunny October afternoon. It was chilled out, not very strenuous and a great way to see and appreciate the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Bridge. A bit pricey but that's just NY. Tour guide was good, a little theatrical! Would recommend.",Date of experience: October 2017,Central Park Sightseeing,4,"New York City, New York"
