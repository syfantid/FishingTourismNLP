Amazing tour with Efthi and Dimitrios!,"We loved this special boat trip in Katelios. It’s so different to typical cruises and we feel lucky to have had a taste of real Greek life in Kefalonia.

We had three opportunities to swim in the clear turquoise sea and enjoyed lots of relaxation time. We released the fish from the nets and Efthi cooked us a beautiful fresh meal. We drank homemade wine, ate fresh salads and tucked into the tastiest fish fresh from the sea.

It’s a day we will never forget! It’s great going with a small group of people as you have the chance to talk over lunch as well as hear Efthi’s stories.

Thank you Efthi, Dimitrios and Mohammed! We loved it and will hopefully be back in the future.

Amazing Tapas Tour with Izaskun,"We had a fantastic tapas tour with Izaskun! We saw some amazing parts of the city that we wouldn’t have visited otherwise. Iza is a great guide as she knows the local area so well, is great at bringing people together and is just so fun! It was my birthday and she made it extra special by ordering me a cake at the final restaurant. Amazing food, great company and an all round brilliant experience.

"Amazing food, drinks, service and atmosphere",Such a fantastic meal here a couple of months ago. The staff are so friendly and the food is delicious. Real authentic taste of southern America! This place would be even better if they extended their opening hours (please!),Date of visit: July 2016,Alabama's All American Eatery,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Very poor service,"Visited last Friday night for a last minute meal. The restaurant was busy but no more so than your average Italian in Manchester city centre on a Friday evening.

It took 20 minutes for them to take a drinks order, another 20 for food then a staggered wait of 30 mins between courses and the bill. Some staff were clearly rushed off their feet and tried to help but others were rude and even held their hand up to my friend to silence her when she asked for the bill whilst she chatted at the bar.

It sounds made up but unbelievably true.

Very expensive for the quality of food and service.... Highly average.",Date of visit: July 2016,Don Giovanni,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Random,"Very affordable deal from Livingsocial. We had been warned by previous reviews that the spa's location is odd, being under a railway arch/above a light fitting shop so we were prepared for this. The main thing that let the place down was that we were not made to feel welcome at any point. There wasn't any communication re treatments, water, changing rooms, toilets and barely a hello. Also, the massage techniques were very different after speaking to the friend I went with and mine felt inexperienced compared to others I've had. There was far too much oil (with no suggestion of a shower/thermal pool use) and the room was very cold so overall the treatments were not great. The afternoon tea was also of poor quality - the scones and mini rolls tasted stale and they just left us to it after that. Again, it all felt a bit awkward/random so we just left. I'd advise to pay a little more for a more customer focused spa.",Date of experience: May 2016,Jade Spa,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
