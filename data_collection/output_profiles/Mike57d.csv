Now this is one to visit,Tucked away in Queen Avenue just of Castle Street you will find Queens Wine bar and bistro. We went on Sunday and chose from the 3 courses for £20 menu amazing value for such well prepared and presented food. Nothing was too much trouble and we certainly will return.,Date of visit: February 2020,Queens Wine Bar and Bistro,1,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"
Very good food,We ate here 3 times during our stay as in our opinion this was the best restaurant open given we were there at the end of the season. Wonderful fresh fish cooked to perfection and interesting recipes.,Date of visit: October 2019,Socrates Tavern-Restaurant,1,"Chrani, Greece"
Delightful,From the moment we arrived to the time we left the owners of this establishment could of dome no more. They are so friendly and can not do enough for you. the accommodation is spotless and is in the heart of the village. Highly recommended.,Date of stay: October 2019,Theoxenia Hotel Apartments,1,"Chrani, Greece"
Great Value and no Entertainment,We were well received on arrival and everything made very clear.Our apartment was spacious and clean and terrific value for money. The pool area was always quiet to the point where I felt sorry for the lifeguard!! On our day of departure were allowed to use courtesy villa for shower etc.,Date of stay: September 2019,Nuramar Apartments,1,"Menorca, Spain"
Best on the Marina,We had 2 meals here and on both occasions had the daily fish specials. I love it when you go back to a place and you get the same standard of service and food as you did the first. Consistency is the name of the game and this place delivers both in service and food quality.,Date of visit: September 2019,Asador On Egin,1,"Menorca, Spain"
Don’t order food,Just the most appalling excuse for a tapas restaurant. Drink perhaps fine but so many better places nearby.,Date of visit: September 2019,Bar Las Tapas,1,"Menorca, Spain"
Great Night Hidden Gem,We were a party of 5 on Saturday evening the place was busy but nothing was too much trouble. The food was excellent and the service attentive.,Date of visit: June 2019,Clockworks,1,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"

Simply the best,We have been to Seville a few times such a beautiful City but if you don’t visit this restaurant you have missed out. The lady who looks after you is a complete delight and the food is outstanding simply a must.,Date of visit: May 2019,Zalata Restaurante & Tapas,1,"Seville, Spain"
Exceptional,"I was bought this as a gift. I never really appreciated how busy the place was and as a consequence could never get booked in. They kindly extended my voucher and we got a table for lunch nearly 3 months later!. The food, service and the staff were all just exceptional. I have been in the industry for over 40 years as this was by far my most enjoyable experience. I can not speak highly enough of the place and yes it is expensive but would I go back without a doubt.",Date of visit: August 2018,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Whats Happened to this place?!!,This was our 5th visit to Katelios and Captain jerry's got 80% of our business. This year one visit was enough. It is hard to put your finger on it but fish not cooked as well as previous and just a different feel to the place.,Date of visit: June 2018,Captain Jerry's,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great Food,Maria's has improved so much over last year and I think probably the best most consistent restaurant on the strip. Serves a variety of dishes but none of them let you down.,Date of visit: June 2018,Maria's Taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Just go for the bread!!,The food here is really first rate and has improved so much in the last year it is almost unrecognisable. They make their own bread and it is just fantastic o really special place.,Date of visit: June 2018,Cozy,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Welcome back to the 70’s,If you were around then and enjoyed the cuisine you will love this place!! There is no doubt it has a market but certainly not for me. Staff very friendly and helpful.,Date of visit: April 2018,J.J.'s Cafe del Mar,1,"Nerja, Spain"
Great again,Probably one of the most consistent restaurants you can go to and that supported by Christian’s fantastic service great day thank you.,Date of visit: January 2018,Cote Bistro - Liverpool,1,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"
Fantastic,"We loved everything about this place. The service extremely friendly and helpful food to die for if you go you must try the Eggs with Truffle but do listen to the instructions or you end as my wife did!!
The impromptu cabaret by man/woman with his castanets was the icing on the cake.",Date of visit: October 2017,Bardot Barcelona,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
The best,We visited most of the recommended restaurants on this coastline but this was by far the best yes you did wait but this is fresh food cooked from scratch very accommodating and friendly.,Date of visit: September 2017,Taverna Agni,1,"Corfu, Greece"
Really Good Food,We visited here on a Saturday lunch time very helpful waiter talked us through the menu which is essentially small plates. We had a mixture of both fish and meat but I must say the confit of duck was the best I have ever tasted. A real gem of a place and well worth a visit.,Date of visit: July 2017,Petit Parle,1,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"
Friendly Service,From the moment we arrived to departure everybody we interacted with was delightful. Nice clean room with a half bottle of complimentary red wine (nice touch). Nice bar with good choice and excellent cooked to order breakfast.,Date of stay: May 2017,The Crown Inn,1,"Amersham, United Kingdom"
Indian will never be the same,We went to the new water street restaurant. Certainly not a traditional Sunday lunch but well worth the effort. Such interesting and tasty food served in very modern and stylish surroundings. So impressed booked a table for 10 on grand national Saturday.,Date of visit: January 2017,Mowgli Street Food - Bold Street,1,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"
Unique,"Not really sure what to expect and having to be at the boat at 7.30am was not the holiday experience I was hoping for. However from reaching the beach and being greeted by a beautiful sunrise to meeting Efi, Dimitrios and his parents on the boat my concerns had disappeared. The hospitality and friendliness that was extended to us and our 2 other fellow fishermen knew no bounds. Other than the fish we caught ( I use the term we with tongue in cheek) every thing else we ate or drank was either grown in Efi's garden or they had made. Including the wine!!
A truely great day and the only issue we had was we had to get off.",Date of experience: September 2016,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Never Fails,I will start this review by saying it does help if you like fish. They do do grills and steaks but the real deal is the fresh fish. The service is warm and friendly the food is consistantly good the daily offers are always worth looking at and you sit right on the beach. Can't wait for our next visit.,Date of visit: September 2016,Captain Jerry's,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Don't shoot the messenger,"George and Jennifer only lease the bar they are not responsible for the accommodation and any of its short comings. The rooms could do with an upgrade but you spend so little time in them it is not the end of the world. George, Jennifer and Spiros more than make up for them they are delightful and put thier hearts and sould into what they do. You must try Georges fruit yogurt for breakfast and dont miss the Greek night.",Date of stay: June 2015,Mythos Apartments,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic,Great service great food and everybody was so friendly. Liking fish is also a big help we only missed one night!!,Date of visit: June 2015,Captain Jerry's,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great Chef,"Not one of Hilton's best by a long chalk. They even charge for water in your room!!
However the staff in the restaurant on wednesday night were more than charming and the chef on duty who I believes name is Csaba can certainly cook great meal.",Date of stay: February 2015,Hilton Bracknell,1,"Bracknell, United Kingdom"
Simply the Best,What a gem. You enter through a white wooden building to be led through to a stunning dining room. The floor must be worth a fortune I don't know how many dimes cover it great idea. Food service and atmosphere just perfect.We came accross it by chance but I would highly recommend a visit. Then walk your lunch of down the high line.,Date of visit: February 2015,The Standard Grill,1,"New York City, New York"
What Terrific Value for Money,"4poster bed,air conditioning,hair dryer,safe and fridge.Full en-suite and breakfast included all for £15 a night (2 people) exceptional. Friendly staff very helpful would highly recommend. Did I mention the pool!!",Date of stay: June 2013,Moroccan House Hotel,1,"Marrakech, Morocco"
