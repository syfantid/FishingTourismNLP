Something for everyone,Don't miss this lovely little museum. It might look like a dusty old museum from the past and it is - there are no digital interractive displays here but it is packed to the rafters with interesting tit bits and tales of the sea and the area. Full of odd and interesting objects the kids will enjoy it as well as you. Nice tea and cake at the cafe is available outside (not the best scones but good enough ) - a good spot for sitting and watching the world go by after your visit (mind the sea gulls though!),Date of experience: August 2018,Polperro Heritage Museum of Smuggling & Fishing,4,"Polperro, United Kingdom"
Simple cafe with lovely vibe,Simple cafe selling good chips and decent snacks. Lovely vibe - very relaxed. Basic toilet. Overlooking the most lovely beach - not at all overcrowded. Very long walk down to the cafe and long walk back up.,Date of visit: August 2018,Eddystone Beach Cafe,4,"Torpoint, United Kingdom"
"Good surf school, amazing beach cafe, hell of a walk down!!",Lovely day on this beach - really friendly surf school. This is a small outfit. Simple cafe. Really relaxed vibe. Coaching could have been more hands on (instructors did not get in) but my son had a good time. The beach is vast and beautiful - great to walk along if you are not surfing. It's a very long walk down to the beach and a tiring walk back up after surfing so be prepared and travel light!,Date of experience: August 2018,Adventure Bay Surf School,4,"Torpoint, United Kingdom"
Got my grumpy unsporty son hooked - that's saying something !,Well done to these guys who managed to hook my son! He was the youngest in the group and was well looked after. The coaches joined the kids in the water - which not all surf schools do as we then discovered at another surf school outside st ives. Hats off to them - and thank you!,Date of experience: August 2018,St Ives Surf School,4,"St Ives, United Kingdom"
Good fish and chips but too limited,Decent fish and chips and reasonably priced but this restaurant did not serve any fresh fish other than the battered kind - so a bit limited for me,Date of visit: August 2018,Harbour Fish & Chips,4,"St Ives, United Kingdom"
Decent fish restaurant,Decent fish restaurant. Fresh caught fish - well cooked side by side with fish and chips - something for everyone,Date of visit: August 2018,Seafood Cafe,4,"St Ives, United Kingdom"
Chaotic busy amusement arcade - lots of fun,Great for an hours entertainment with the kids. Rides are not to pricey. Arcade games are packed in. Pretty much something for everyone. Bit hot and crowded though in the summer months,Date of experience: August 2018,Harbour Amusements,4,"St Ives, United Kingdom"
Lovely,Small gallery of Hepworth's work tucked away in st Ives. The gardens are strewn with her sculptures. An oasis after the bustle of St Ives. Only place I think where you can see so much of her work in one place - with an interesting little photo gallery. I went twice and could have gone again - once alone and once with three children who also enjoyed it. Not overwhelming for the kids as it is not a big place at all Worth getting the combined ticket with the Tate.,Date of experience: August 2018,Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden,4,"St Ives, United Kingdom"
Enjoyed our stay and great location but not ideal for self catering family of 4,"Pros - decent location - lots of grocery stores nearby and superb Chinese restaurants around the corner. Place was clean and generally comfortable if cramped. My double bed was very comfortable and I appreciated the separate bed room that not all family places have. The decor is cute and individual decor. The staff pleasant enough.

Cons - the place is supposed to sleep four and it does - but at an incredible squeeze. Sofa bed is no good for 2 teenage boys - too cramped - it would work for smaller kids though. It was impossible to get 4 of us around the table. If you want to self cater it is not the place to come - although there is a kitchenette - the hob didn't work and there was no oven so pretty much useless for self catering. There was a microwave. I found it odd that the staff had no information to hand eg a map of the area - odd but not a big issue since you can get them at the local metro station",Date of stay: April 2018,Les Patios du Marais,4,"Paris, France"
From the very good to the awful !,"This is a difficult review to write as this hotel had so much going for it but some terrible points.

Staff at the hotel were mostly lovely - especially in the bar area - staff were friendly and helpful. Some lovely reception staff . Bar staff worked so hard and were really friendly - they made the chilled relaxed feel of the bar. Decent - good quality food and a good price. Cocktails were good - not like the crap cocktails in the many sports bars next door. Pool area entertainment was fine but was low key and only 2 - 3 times during our 2 week stay.

Pool - not as big as it looks in the pictures but very clean and pleasant . I hate the towel culture but I guess that happens everywhere. They have a notice saying that you can't drink your own drinks or have your own food at the pool area. I don't like that given I have paid to stay in a self catering place I feel I should be able to drink and eat what I like. I bought drinks and crisps . snacks to have at the pool at the market next door as it is 1/2 the price. Nobody called me on it so I guess they turn a blind eye.

Rooms: Our rooms looked absolutely nothing like in the picture. We had a 70's bathroom suite - blue ceramic - . The bed rooms were a bit better - they have tried to up date a bit with a few snazzy pictures and some new furniture but it was not great. I do resent them mot being honest with their pictures. I think that we were in the old block and there are new blocks that are better - clearly they used the pitures from those newer blocks because our rooms were really nothing like them.

Bathoom - aside from the bad decor there was scale everywhere and it was so badly designed that you could not take a shower without flooding the bathroom unless you angled the shower head into a tiny spot in the corner. However - other than that everything worked and there was plenty of hot running water.

Bedrooms - we had a family suite with 2 bedrooms and a living area / kitchenette and bathroom.Main bed room was really nice - big bed - very comfy, lots of storage. Both bedrooms had nice balconies to sit out on (furniture only in one balcony however) . The air con unit was positioned in one of the bedrooms only and the air con only cooled one bedroom In temperatures of around 35 - 38 it was impossible to have a comfortable nights sleep in the other bedroom. To add insult to injury you have to pay 7 euro per day for the air con and that only cools one room. I was told there were other rooms with 2 air con units - one in each room but the staff also told me that you would have to pay for 2 air con units double the price of one - 14 euro per day for air con. It all gets pretty steep!

The other issue was that the second room in the family suite did not have beds - we had one sofa and one narrow chair (with arms! that you kept bumping into if you turned around! ) that turned into a bed. They were both pretty hard as nails. They gave us some foam cushions to put on them after we complained which improved things but really these beds would only work for very little children indeed. My 16 and 14 year olds really struggled what with uncomfortable beds and the heat. This seemed to be new furniture - I am not sure that you would get better in any of the other family suites.

There were no real cooking facilities in the room. A tiny fridge, a kettle and 4 mugs were provided. No utensils, cooking equipment or anything. Did not bother me overly as I was able to steal spoons , glasses and bits and bobs from the kitchen but a bit odd to me given that this is a self catering place.

Housekeeping was good overall - things were kept clean - they cleaned every other day and we had one change of bedding and towels over the 2 weeks. Housekeeping did not in 2 weeks did not wash any of the mugs though and I think they should do that as a matter of course.

Location - this hotel is on a strip of road with sports bars all along. It is handy in that there are supermarkets just next door. Buses run regularly to Rhodes from the road - it is only 15 minutes. It is 9 euro by taxi if you hail it from the road. Just across the road there is a beach resort where you can get a bed by their pool and use that and have a dip in the sea by the beach if you buy some drinks while you are there. That is very pleasant and the food is good. There is a similar set up / pool and beach bar - turn left out of sunny days and across the road and to a shopping centre - its at the very back of the shopping center - it is not as smart but they do very very good burgers and the kids can go in the main pool which isn't allowed in the other place.

Excursions - Sunny Days is expensive. We did everything from Sigma travel - left out of sunny days and along the road and in the same small shopping centre on the beach side of the road .They were very reasonable and picked you up from the hotel so it was easy.

All in we had a really good time. We clearly seemed to have a room in the old block and not the new modernised one. I would book Sunny Days again but only if I could guarantee that I got a room in a modern block with air con in both rooms and proper beds. I am not sure if there are any rooms that can offer all of that though so I would probably be inclined to go elsewhere. For the price though I am not sure that there is much better..",Date of stay: August 2017,Sunny Days Hotel,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Really lovely,Just good place to wander and enjoy - walk around the side streets and avoid the crowds. Really lovely place .,Date of experience: August 2017,Medieval City,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Nice place - kids can't use main pool though,"This was a pleasant place to spend a few hours. You can use the loungers and use the pool facilities here if you have a drink or something to eat. Kids were disappointed that they had to use the baby pool - they are 14 and 16. So we did not return other and went to a place further up at the back at the shopping center which was really good but less fussy,,",Date of visit: August 2017,Villa di Mare,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Lovely family style restaurant,We enjoyed a good evening meal here with the kids. Very good pizza indeed. Free desert. Lovely friendly service. Reasonable prices. What's not to like?,Date of visit: August 2017,Napoli Pizzeria-Restaurant,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
There must be better beaches,"We spent a day here having been told it was a sandy beach, It is not - it is totally pebbly. The diving board is the only attraction on the beach and we had to pay 25 euro's for a sun bed (I am sure that we would have found cheaper if we had walked further though). It was very crowded. There must be much better beaches around than this - next time around I would head for falariki or one of the other resorts - just for a bit a sand at the least and some banana boats for the kids..",Date of experience: August 2017,Paralia Elli,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Best day of our whole holiday,"Went on this fishing trip with my sons - 16, 14 and 8. This was a lovely quiet trip with just a small boat and a small group of people. Run by such friendly people. We had a great time fishing, had the chance to swim between stops and were served a great lunch with fresh fresh sea bream. Highly recommend this trip - you will find their stall on Mandrake Harbour at the end nearest the deer statues.",Date of experience: August 2017,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Good time - bring socks !,"This is just a great big water park. It is a bit shabby in places but everything works and there are slides for everyone ! From the really small tots , to the medium sized child slightly nervous ones and not forgetting the fearless bigger ones. It is really big but there is a little train that takes you all over if you are too tired to walk. There are plenty of sun beds to lounge on if you don;t want to do the slides. Food - cafe is pretty awful bot not over priced. You you can buy biscuits and crisps in a small super market which were not over priced They say you can't bring your own food in but there was no one searching bags. Good locker facilities so you don't have to carry things around. The ground gets scorching hot so bring socks to wear around the park and on the slides - or water shoes - much more practical than flip flops - I wish we had had some.",Date of experience: August 2017,Water Park,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Great potted history - very entertaining,Really enjoyed this potted history of Rhodes. Very informative. The apparently 9D (what is 9D??) experience entertained the kids too. Bit pricey. We did not watch the cartoon as well for that reason. Very clean toilets !!!,Date of experience: August 2017,Throne of Helios,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Love this restaurant,Consistently good food - fresh and really tasty. Service impeccable and very quick. Really good value for the quality.,Date of visit: June 2016,Giggling Squid Henley,4,"Henley-on-Thames, United Kingdom"
Good solid indian restaurant,Lovely food very well priced. The food is pretty standard fare but a nice place to go. They do a range of non indian foods but we did not try that - so just rating on the basis of the indian food.,Date of visit: January 2016,Asiana Spice,4,"Henley-on-Thames, United Kingdom"
Lovely Cakes,Lovely cakes at this little cafe in Henley. It is small and intimate so don't expect to be able to share a private conversation! Popular with locals mums or people who have no jobs to go to (really? In Henley?) .,Date of visit: April 2016,Hot Gossip Coffee House,4,"Henley-on-Thames, United Kingdom"
