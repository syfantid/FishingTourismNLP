Lovely day out with lovely people,"I went on the trip with Antonia and her lovely family last weekend. She was very nice and helpful when I was arranging the trip with her, and she was so lovely on the day. My elder daughter got some sea sickness (our fault, as she gets motion sickness in cars and we thought she'd be ok with a pill, so don't be discouraged), but we still had a good day. Really nice food, quite an educational experience (fishing in those waters is not an easy way to make a living!), and a great way to get a different view of a beautiful island. Would definitely recommend.",Date of experience: April 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Thank you for a great lunch,"Visited with my family last Friday, at the very start of the season when most of the touristy places are still closed, and we were in fact the only people there. Ioanna was so kind when I was arranging to visit by email, and was so nice and welcoming to everyone (especially our two young kids). The food was really nice and the place itself is also lovely. A little difficult to find, but definitely worth the trek. Thank you so much!",Date of visit: April 2018,Captain Nicolas,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely place on Easter Sunday,"Visited on Easter Sunday. Tricky to find anywhere open on that day in Kefalonia, but asked the gents on Facebook beforehand and it was the first day they opened. The place was full of families and they had a whole spit-roasted lamb on the barbeque! The view is impressive enough, but I will always remember the food, which was generous, delicious, and lovely in every way. We had a salad of home-grown vegatbles, the best Tsatziki ever, and probably the best barbequed meat I've ever eaten. The two twins are really nice, treated my kids so well, and daddy is also lovely! Only problem is they are Liverpool fans ;)
Best food we had on out visit to Kefalonia and some of the best food I've had anywhere (and we've been around a bit).
Bit of a trek to get here from Argostoli, but definitely worth it. Really stunning countryside around here, too, and a real Greek taverna experience. If only all restaurants were like this...I forgot to mention that by UK standards it's also ridiculously cheap. I was almost embarrassed...
Thanks again!",Date of visit: April 2018,Ladokolla Stin Plagia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
High quality food,"Visited here twice over the Easter weekend. Was one of the few places open in Argostoli and we were virtually alone on both our visits (although we do have young kids so tend to eat early). We got very nice food on both occasions. They really know what they're doing. Decent value and nice service. Can't say what it would be like on a busy night...a little more expensive than most in town, but good quality and very clean.",Date of visit: April 2018,Ampelaki Greek Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
disappointing,ice cream did not taste fresh and a far cry from the real gelato we had in portugal last week. shop smelled strongly of the toilets and the service was the usual surly teenage girl. poor experience overall.,Date of visit: August 2017,Morelli's Gelato Broadstairs,1,"Broadstairs, United Kingdom"
slow slow slow,"kept waiting ages for food even though the place was half empty. waitresses were nice and doing their best, but there were no mussels left or prawns. food was decent when it arrived but i would hate to try it when it's busy. if you're short staffed and there's no seafood left then do us a favour and don't open please.",Date of visit: August 2017,Taylors,1,"Broadstairs, United Kingdom"
First class driver,Antonio is very professional and a very nice man. First rate service and obviously loves his job and his city. Porto is a splendid city and Antonio offers the best possible first impression of the place. We hope to use his services again.,Date of experience: August 2017,Executive Pro Driver,1,"Porto, Portugal"
Wonderful trips to Sintra and Lisbon,"Spent two lovely days with Miguel on trips to Sintra and Lisbon. He is very professional, laid-back, friendly, and really knows his stuff. He was also nice to my two young kids and was happy to tailor our days for our taste. Considering the level of service he gives, the price is also really decent. I recommend Miguel wholeheartedly and will be happy to use his services again.",Date of experience: April 2017,RoadTrip Sintra & Lisboa,1,"Sintra, Portugal"
Lovely day with a perfect gentleman,Adolfo is a true gentleman and professional in every way. He was very nice to our kids and we felt totally safe with his driving (quite an achievement around Naples). You can't go wrong with Adolfo and I throroughly recommend him. Thanks again!,Date of experience: April 2016,Adolfo Scotto di Luzio Private Driver,1,"Naples, Italy"
Great place for families,Very friendly host who was particularly kind to our baby and six year old daughter. Excellent location where you can walk to most places quite easily (although a bit noisy through the night with the traffic). Breakfast adequate.,Date of stay: April 2016,La Baia Di Partenope,1,"Naples, Italy"
