IGNORE ALL BAD REVIEWS PLACE IS INCREDIBLE,"This place is incredible. The service is so special they go out of their way to give you the most authentic experience possible. The food is just on another level. I can't believe the bad reviews they get! Honestly they do not deserve this! The Turkish coffee made by the young waitress was amazing and served with Turkish delight, something which wasn't on the menu but went out of her way to make it for us. Thank you for a lovely evening and such a pleasant experience, we will be back! Compliments to the chefs, outstanding food!",Date of visit: October 2019,Ephesus Grill,5,"Chester, United Kingdom"
Highlight of the holiday (and we did a lot!),"We couldn't rate the Michalis high enough! We were so happy to experience this with them. From start to finish they made us feel right at home. I've been speaking to Antonia two months prior to coming out. And not once she was pushy to book the trip as I am really untrusting with excursions due to the fact it was fishing and my partner can't eat lobster and neither can I due to allergies also I'm gluten free! Antonia went to great trouble to get me Gluten Free Bread for Appetisers (which was incredible!) and gluten free biscuits so I didn't miss out on morning coffee. Her husband also cooked me and my partner the most delicious Chicken dish, with gorgeous potato salad and tomato salad to accompany whilst the rest of the boat ate their caught lobster and spaghetti which looked absolutely incredible!! The whole experience from catching the fish in the nets through to swimming in the clearest of waters, drinking Robola Wine and laughing until our bellies hurt was just amazing. We toured the whole island yet this is honestly the best trip we've been on! 60 Euros to include all of that and the highest quality lobster worth 60-120 euro per kg and these were over a kilo! Value for money is absolutely unbelievable and such a beautiful family. I will continue to keep in touch with Antonia and cannot wait to come back next year and do it all again! Thank you so much all! Xxx",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
