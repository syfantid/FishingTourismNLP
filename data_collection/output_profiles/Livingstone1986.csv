Amazing experience - Highlight of our trip to Santorini!,"This wonderful tour was without a doubt the highlight of our trip to Santorini. Anthony, his father and mother were so friendly and welcoming and had thought of everything to make this trip a truly magical experience. If you are interested in taking a day trip on a boat in Santorini do yourself a favour and book this instead of the countless catamaran boats that are available. Whilst the catamarans race to squeeze in a 10 minute swim at the hot spring if you're lucky, we were able to take our time swimming and eat delicious freshly cooked fish.",Date of experience: August 2020,Flora Fishing Tours,5,"Santorini, Greece"
