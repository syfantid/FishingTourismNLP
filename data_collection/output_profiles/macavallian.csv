Lovely beach take water,"We visited this beach twice in our week stay - as other reviews have said access is by boat or walk ( we had a car so did the later ) , walk is 20-30 minutes and only tricky at the end ( steep and a bit loose in places ) . Top end of the beach is nude and much quieter than the end where the “ cheat boat” arrives lol .

There’s some varying fish to see if you fancy a snorkel , it’s a totally unserviced beach so take plenty of water .",Date of experience: August 2020,Katergo Beach,1,"Folegandros, Greece"
Bargain of the whole week,"After being let down with a cancelled booking at some apartments in folegandros and the arriving to some very basic accommodation we jumped on booking .com and found chora resorts and more over found a special offer ! We duly switched hotels and spent a week here .
The room we had was small but very nice , breakfast was challenging due to CV19 restrictions but the staff did their very best , the staff here are lovely though . The guy that booked us in and assisted us on that horrible arrival night was fantastic ( we only saw him that night ) the bar man Sargis (spelt wrong I’m sure )had limited English but really couldn’t find enough for you . We would recommend this place purely on the staff and facilities, great location aswell it lacks the high up views of some of the hotels up the hill and is located close to the petrol station but that would be its only negative.
Easy flat walk into chora ( 2 mins )",Date of stay: August 2020,Chora Resort Hotel and Spa,1,"Folegandros, Greece"
Fantastic octopus,Located above Nicolas beach - I had the octopus dish cooked in sauce and it was to die for - house rose wine is recommend as is the knowledge of the lady that runs this place . Good Greek food as it should be !,Date of visit: August 2020,Papalagi Seafood,1,"Folegandros, Greece"
Oh dear! Slippery,"Oh dear - we visited this restaurant twice - the first time they literally had sold out of everything , it was late so we left and gave it another go later in the week . This was the worst choice we made all week , I had the saganaki cheese for starter which was ok and I then had sardines for main . These sardines where not cut and opened then cooked but whole and one or two of them was large hence the bones didn’t soften . My partner had beef tenderloin which really wasn’t that tender .
All in all a pretty poor meal coupled with no house rose wine but a more expensive bottle - you would think it couldn’t get any worse , but oh yes it did as in the early hours of the next day both of us was violently sick . My advice avoid this place and the cheesy owner head waiter who asks you how you meal is and answers for you before you get a chance to reply",Date of visit: August 2020,Ta Kouroupia,1,"Folegandros, Greece"
Pretty much as it’s name great,"Pretty much as it’s name great gyros and souvlaki - all on a paper table cloth that has a Greek language lesson on it - the owner is a smashing fella ( we literally nipped in on our last afternoon , should have ate here before )",Date of visit: August 2020,Souvlaki Club,1,"Folegandros, Greece"
I can’t actually believe I’m,"I can’t actually believe I’m writing this negative review mainly on the basis of attitude of staff - we attempted to visit tonight and was told to come back in 30 minutes ( even though they had 4 spare tables ) , we went down the road had a drink and duly returned- the waitress looked disappointed but showed us to a table and proceeded to ignore us for 15 minutes before cleaning and setting table - the menu was 5 minutes later in the form of a tacky plastic double sided A5 stand which held a QR code , she literally threw the aforesaid stand onto the table and walked away . We asked for an old school
Paper menu - she said yes it’s on your phone but I’ll go get you a paper menu ( this never surfaced ) we then had made the decision that we had had enough and left !

If you want a warm family meal look elsewhere other than this pretentious place —/ possibly the second worst restaurant I’ve visited in Greece , go elsewhere !",Date of visit: August 2020,Eva's Garden,1,"Folegandros, Greece"
