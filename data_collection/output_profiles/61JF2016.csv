Another fantastic trip!,"We had another fantastic trip with Efi and Dimitri (our third!). It's amazing to see the catch brought on board and if you want to you can help to untangle the fish from the nets. The swimming stops are always in beautiful locations and it's quite easy to get into the water and back on board again. I had a bad arm but still managed it! The lunch Efi prepares is the best fish you will ever taste and most of the other ingredients come from their garden, even the very good wine is from their grapes. Next time we are in Kefalonia we will definitely do this trip again - it's a lovely day out and Efi and Dimitri are now dear friends.",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Another fantastic trip!,"We went out with Efi, Dimitris and Mohammed on this trip last June and absolutely loved it. When we decided to come back to stay in lovely Katelios again this year we knew we had to do this trip again. We cannot recommend it highly enough. It's a great day out - you can help with getting fish out of the nets if you want to, swim in the beautiful water and then eat the fish which Efi cooks to perfection. A lovely relaxing day in great company!",Date of experience: June 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic day!,"We went on this trip when we were staying in Katelios in June 2016. It was a fantastic day out. It was so interesting to see the nets brought in with the wide variety of fish that was caught. We went swimming off the boat at a beautiful beach and then Efi cooked a delicious lunch using several types of the lovely fresh fish. It was the best fish I had ever tasted. I can highly recommend this trip. Efi and Dimitrios make you very welcome on their boat and make it a very enjoyable trip. If we go back there, we will definitely go on the trip again.",Date of experience: June 2016,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
