Never again,"We were looking forward to some Lebanese food, fresh, tasty and mouth watering.
Unfortunately this place does not have much to do with Lebanese food.
Firstly, the salads are not fresh (a big no no in Lebanese kitchens) are done and put together in the morning, the Fattoush was soggy with the tomatoes and cucumbers soft, after 1 bite I left it on the plate. The Tabbouleh again we were told was done in the morning, I didn't dare order it! Tabbouleh should be prepared fresh to order, not 10 hours previously! The Halloumi with Zatar had no Zatar, instead of it was a chilli paste. All this might be ok for people who don't know the Lebanese kitchen and Beirut Street Food, but for connoisseurs is a disaster.
The rest of the food was ok, but I wouldn't rave about it, they might attempt a Lebanese Fusion Cuisine, but is failing miserably, no wonder the restaurant was empty.
Never again for us.",Date of visit: March 2020,Kababji,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Delicious,"Absolutely delicious home style cooked food!
If you want to eat where the locals eat, than this is the place!
It's a small restaurant, but is clean, lovely service and a good selection of home cooked food.
We had the calamari cooked in tomato sauce, aubergine loaded with mince and topped with bechamel sauce and baked, and the green beans in tomato sauce.
Simple food, bursting with flavours, we could easily eat there every single day!",Date of visit: September 2019,Tzivras Restaurant 1933,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Absolutely avoid!,"We used BA transfer for the past 5-6 years. Tonight we booked the trip to Gatwick for our holiday, 5min later they called to tell us there is an additional charge for using the M25! How on earth do they expect to get to Gatwick if not via M25? The charge is not displayed nor mentioned at the point of booking, they call after to fleece more money, this practice is illegal, ALL charges must be displayed at the point of booking! They tried to argue that is in their T&C, guess what, is not. They are deliberately trying to rip off customers AFTER they make the booking! Needless to say we cancelled! I am now taking this matter to TFL to review their operator licence, and to Trading Standards as they are breaching the legislation.",Date of experience: August 2019,BA Transfer,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Avoid,"We used to come here regular, the last 2 times was a disappointment.
The restaurant is dirty, the staff is swiping the food rests on the floor. The toilets are dirty, for me those 2 reasons are enough not to set foot in it again.
Had a waiter walking pass with his trousers half way down his butt, as if he was going to a street corner yob reunion. That is absolutely disgusting, he is walking pass people eating their food! I've told the manager, he pulled them up, 5 min later he was with the trousers down again.
It will be a very long time before I set foot in this Nando's again!",Date of visit: March 2019,Nando's Putney,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Amazing experience,"Absolutely amazing experience and fantastic atmosphere!
So many different stalls with food and drinks, that we had to go back several time.
Very clean and delicious food, no matter what you choose. Very good drinks and good value for money.",Date of visit: November 2018,Time Out Market Lisboa,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
Overrated,"We booked this as our wedding anniversary dinner. Cosy place, attentive waiters. The restaurant was clean and well maintained.
Considering that is a sea-food restaurant, you would expect every customer to get bibs to protect the clothing, everyone did get them, except for us. Was not a bit deal, we were a bit more careful and kept it clean.
We had the Supernova platter, which was rather avarage. For how much it costed, I would have expected it to be cooked fresh, but was not, except for the prawns in garlic sauce which were delicious, everything else was pre-cooked and cold.
Would we go again? No.",Date of visit: November 2018,Cais ao Mar - Cervejaria Marisqueira,1,"Lisbon, Portugal"
"Lovely food, poor service","We always stop at Comptoir Libanaise when we fly from Gatwick. The food is always fantastic, but the service has always been slow even when is not busy. This time was really slow... Not even 8 tables busy, and took them more than 10min to come and take the order. When we tried to pay, we called one of the waiters, he waltzed pass and went to chat up and flirt with another waitress, 5 min later managed to grab someone's attention.
They should be a bit more attentive when people want to place an order or pay, we had plenty of time, but others travel from longer distances and don't have the time to waste because the staff can't be bothered.",Date of visit: November 2018,Comptoir libanais,1,"Crawley, United Kingdom"
Delicious food,Met with some friends for an evening meal at Ladokolla. The service was fantastic and the food delicious and fresh! Loved how they served the food on paper. Definitely recommended and we will go back when we return next year!,Date of visit: July 2018,Ladokolla,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Amazing day trip,"What a fantastic day we had! Started in Agia Pelagia around 8am, coffee and fresh home baked cake soon after leaving the port, then set the new net and went to pick up the already set one which had quite a few lobsters! Set off to Pessada where we stopped for a swim while Antonia and her husband were preparing the fresh catch. We had an amazing meal and left around 15:30.
Antonia and her husband are lovely and very knowledgeable about fishing and the area. Their fishing is environmentally friendly, all the small catch is thrown back and they don't fish more than they need.

A lovely day with a lovely family, certainly the highlight of our holiday!",Date of experience: July 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Amazing Black Cherry Cheesecake!,"We done our yearly trip to St George's castle, and as usual we visited Kastro. We settled for cakes and drinks, and they were absolutely amazing! The Black Cherry Cheesecake is to die for and I can't wait to have it again next year!",Date of visit: July 2018,Kastro Cafe,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic pizza!,"The sourdough pizza is out of this world, so are the starters.
The service is excellent and friendly, a big thank you to Umberto for always making us feel welcome, he is a big part of why we keep going back.
The atmosphere is lovely and relaxed.
Well worth the wait if is too busy.",Date of visit: March 2018,Franco Manca Putney,1,"London, United Kingdom"
How on earth is this a top restaurant?,"I've been there twice, it was the same each time. What do I start with? The appalling service or the terrible food?
The waiters could not be bothered to work there, you could barely catch them to ask for something and when you did, they looked like you disturbed them and would take ages for them to bring what you asked for.
The food was pretty bad too. My cousin had beans with smoked pork, it was so old is was fizzy, he could not eat it! The Mici had nothing to do with mici, they were just minced pork meat shaped as mici and not even fresh, it looked like they were reheated leftovers from others, although we didn't eat them, we made sure they didn't end up on someone else's plate. The fries were reheated. The couple sitting next to us, barely touched their food and sent back the dessert.
A pretty much bad experience, been there twice, two years apart, and was absolutely the same.
Although is cheap, the poor quality of food and service is not worth it. Avoid!",Date of visit: February 2018,Casa Magica,1,"Busteni, Romania"
"Delicious, fresh seafood","We chose this bistro for our wedding anniversary. We went the day before to reserve a table and order the seafood platter, £75 of deliciousness worth every penny!
The seafood platter was absolutely delicious, fresh and cooked to perfection, they recommended a bottle of Portuguese white wine which was spot on. Luckily we didn't order any starters as the platter was more than enough for 2 people.
The atmosphere is relaxing and friendly, perfect place for a lovely dinner.",Date of visit: November 2017,Bistro Rosa,1,"Jersey, United Kingdom"
Not up to expectations,"After reading the reviews we decided to go there for dinner.
We chose the Tennerfest menu as we wanted to try different things.
My Surf and turf was supposed to be ribeye, what I got served was a bland sirloin, yes, I do know my beef.
The starter was 1 scallop cut in half, with a bit of pork belly and an apple/vanilla sauce that shouldn't have been on the plate, the flavours did not match.
The restaurant is too expensive for what it actually is, they want to be high end but the food coming out is more mid-range.",Date of visit: November 2017,Quayside Bistro & Grill,1,"Jersey, United Kingdom"
Stuck in time,"The hotel is quite dated, seems to be stuck in 1980's, everything from furniture to linen and cutlery is old.
The bed was quite uncomfortable.
The breakfast was average, but not a smile on the waiters' faces, they looked grim and unhappy.
The only positives were the cleanliness, it was spotless and the location, close to the town centre.
Would I stay here again? No.",Date of stay: November 2017,The Mayfair Hotel,1,"Jersey, United Kingdom"
Not too bad,"We booked a double room, however, the room was so small it should have been a single. The room needed some TLC. The table had a bad angle, things were falling of it, told the receptionist about it and they sorted it by sticking some wood underneath to level it.
The bathroom sink was very small, perhaps was suited best in a spare toilet, not functional for a main bathroom. The grout from the tiles around the door was missing, the shower was big but had low pressure and the handle kept falling off. The bed was not very comfortable and again, at an angle, I think the whole room was at an angle...
The breakfast was good and the staff was fantastic.",Date of stay: August 2017,View Hotel Folkestone,1,"Folkestone, United Kingdom"
Lovely family run taverna,"The setting is fantastic, above the beach with a lovely view. The atmosphere is lovely and relaxing. Stelios and his family are working hard and that can be seen. The food is delicious and the grill is to die for, no matter if is meat or fish! The garlic bread is just amazing.
Thank you Stelios and family for a fantastic experience and delicious food!",Date of visit: July 2017,Apanemo,1,"Crete, Greece"
Lovely place,"This is a lovely taverna right next to the beach. We ate there several days at lunchtime. The Gyros is fantastic, so is the souvlaki and everything else they have on the menu.
The service is good and the atmosphere relaxing.",Date of visit: July 2017,Kyma Taverna,1,"Crete, Greece"
Fantastic place!,"We spent 2 weeks at the lovely Manolis Apartments, which are just a couple of minutes walk from the beach, in a nice and quiet location.
Manolis, his wife Irene and the kids are lovely and always there if you need anything.
We had a 1 bedroom apartment and was spotless, well equipped and everything in good working order.
The kitchen got everything you need to cook, utensils, pots and pans, cutlery, fridge freezer, small grill/oven.
In the livingroom was a single bed and a sofa bed, the bedroom had a queensize bed with a comfy mattress.
The cleaning was done everyday and the towels and linen changed every 2-3 days.
There is a lovely pool in the garden, is kept spotless and they clean it on daily basis.
Manolis and Irene also serve a delicious breakfast, just let them know the day before. The cake and jams are made by Irene herself.
Would definitely recommend it and we will return!
Thank you Manolis and Irene for a lovely stay :)",Date of stay: June 2017,Manolis Apartments,1,"Crete, Greece"
Terrible!,"Visited it today with my wife and a friend. It was not busy, but it took them ages to bring the order. My wife's Americano must have been the coffee they collected from the tables, absolutely disgusting! Had to turn it back and she received a fresh one. The cakes we ordered came well after the coffees, and after we reminded them that we ordered cakes!
Never again!",Date of visit: June 2017,Patisserie Valerie,1,"London, United Kingdom"
"Good food, poor service.","Visited on a Saturday evening with my wife.
The main was good as usual, but the dessert (Black Forest Gateau) was disappointing, quite dry, not sure how fresh it was.
The service was quite poor too, waiters whizzing by but took a while to place the orders and to pay.",Date of visit: April 2017,Stein's,1,"Kingston upon Thames, United Kingdom"
Not impressed,"Went with a group of friends, understandably the food took a time to arrive, so did the drinks, some of them arrived after the food.
The food was ok, maybe a bit dry, but ok for the price.
I made the mistake of going to the toilet after the meal, the floor all through was absolutely dirty, when I came back up the stairs I could see the restaurant floor just as filthy and the bit of kitchen floor that I could see did not look much better! It turned my stomach and trust me, not many things turn my stomach!
If I would have noticed the state of the floor from the begin, I would have walked right out, I am shocked they got a 5* food rating, perhaps the day of the inspection was the last time they cleaned!",Date of visit: March 2017,Lebanese Taverna Express,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Fantastic!,"Fantastic food, service and experience!
The staff is very attentive, the restaurant is spotless, the food is outstanding with quality ingredients!",Date of visit: March 2017,Ottoman Turkish Cuisine,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Not keen on the donation queue,"Good museum, however, it is pretty embarrassing when you have to queue to pass by 2 ladies who make you feel extremely uncomfortable whilst asking you for a donation. Charge for a ticket or install donation boxes around (like other museums do) so people can donate how much they want, when they want, instead of being guilt tripped into it by being watched over by a museum employees to see how much they donate at the entrance of the museum.",Date of experience: March 2016,Science Museum,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Nice,"Although is a nice restaurant and apparently has the best loukoumedes on the island, but the service is poor.
We went at a time when the restaurant was empty, still it took close to 45min for the orders to arrive, then we couldn't see the waitress to ask for more drinks and for the bill, when we finally did, it took about 10min to get the bill, we gave up on drinks and bought some from the shop. If they take so long when the restaurant is empty, can only imagine what is like at busy times.",Date of visit: July 2015,Premier Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Amazing steak!,"We visited this restaurant several times in 2010 (sorry, did not find it on Tripadvisor till now!) and absolutely loved it!
Every single dish we had was delicious! As always, we went for traditional dishes, not burgers and pizza, you can get that back home!
I am a steak lover and I always spend a bit more to get a decent piece of steak, hand on heart, this was the best steak I have ever had in my life! Nothing came close to it ever since, not even in ""posh"" restaurants in London like Marco Pierre White's (don't waste your money there!).
Planing a short break there and this restaurant is definitely on our list!",Date of visit: September 2015,Restaurante Las Delicias,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Stunning,"Visited Alcudia quite a few years ago, it was one of my favourite places.
The old town is charming, with loads of little stores selling everything under the sun. We were lucky to go in a day when the market was on, we picked up quite a few fresh fruits and some gigantic olives which were out of this world.
Highly recommended, however, be warned it can be scorching hot in summer, always have some water with you.",Date of experience: August 2015,Alcudia Old Town,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Fantastic food,"Ate at Ma Goa several times.
Is a small family restaurant with excellent service and mouth watering dishes.
Be prepared for an explosion of flavours, no matter what you will order!",Date of visit: October 2014,Ma Goa,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Improvement needed,"I ordered a Caesar Salad with grilled chicken, what I got was a surprise...
The chicken was boiled and only 3 stripes the size of the finger, not grilled; the salad sauce was an ordinary mayo based sauce (no anchovies or parmesan).
It was a plain chicken salad which was not worth the price.
I give it a 2* because the staff was fantastic and the atmosphere good, but I do not recommend the food.",Date of visit: July 2014,Stag Hotel,1,"Lyndhurst, United Kingdom"
Delicous,"We ate at Eschbacher several times. Every single time to food was delicious and cooked to perfection and they make the best Austrian Goulash!
The service is outstanding, fast and friendly. The restaurant and bar are spotless and clean and I was more than happy to see the head chef coming out of the kitchen and checking that everything was ok, you could clearly see that he is a man who takes pride in his cooking!
A big thank you to Mike and his girlfriend!",Date of visit: November 2013,Hotel Restaurant Eschbacher,1,"Piesendorf, Austria"
Amazing,"We spent a day in the spa and thoroughly enjoyed it!
The prices are acceptable, is extremely clean and everybody is friendly.
They have 3 heated outdoor pools, two of which can be accessed from the inside. They also have 2 indoor pools and a huge water slide for adults!
The bistro and the restaurant are lovely and the prices are affordable.",Date of experience: November 2013,Tauern Spa,1,"Kaprun, Austria"
Restaurant review,"Someone recommended us this restaurant as being one which serves traditional local food.
We done the long walk from Piesendorf to them on a rainy evening, we arrived there and was the most unwelcoming place we ever set foot into.
The menu was quite poor and the food was ok, however, the service was a complete let down, the waitress was more interested in her mobile phone than taking the order from us.",Date of stay: November 2013,Gasthof Waidachhof,1,"Piesendorf, Austria"
Could do better,"The owner of the apartment was nice and friendly, however, the apartment was a let down.
This is the only apartment we ever rented where we were asked to dispose of our own garbage and no one came in to clean, not even once! Forget about having your towels changed. We even had to buy our own toilet paper...
We were upgraded to a 1 bedroom apartment which was on the ground floor, it was probably the only one left free when we arrived and the next morning at 7 we discovered why... Woke up to the lovely sound of ski boots marching down the hall and the door being slammed, this carried on until all the skiing guests were out for the day. That evening we requested to have another room and we were told that everybody will leave the next day and we'll be the only guests left, and we were asked to stay put.
The same evening was a bit hard to get some relaxing time as some guests decided to use the downstairs hall as a conference room for an hour or so and we could hear everything they were talking... We would have put the TV on to cover them up, but even that was not working as was an old one with a remote which didn't match and had to be programmed every time the TV was turned on and we were not told about this until a few days later when we asked.
The bed was huge and comfy, but the pillows were flat and thin, had to roll them up to make an acceptable pillow, the duvets were 2 singles and thin, doubled up with blankets. To be honest, the bed linen was very dated and worn, same as the thin over used towels and the stained chairs.
On the plus, the kitchen was fully equipped, with coffee maker and kettle, all the cutlery you need, pots, pans and frying pans.
With a bit of effort, the apartment would be lovely, providing that a door closer is fitted to avoid the slamming noises from the front door and that the apartment is cleaned on regular basis and not expect the guests to clean it, also a bit of TLC such as new duvets, new pillows, new bed linen, new towels, clean chairs would be welcomed.",Date of stay: November 2013,Mariandls Appartements,1,"Piesendorf, Austria"
Excellent location,"We spent a couple of nights at this hotel, here is our review.

Location - Excellent, close to the Cathedral, shops and restaurants.

Room - We had a double classic room which was facing the roof of the dinning room. The rooms are quite small, a Premier Inn room is much bigger. It was clean, but there was some mold in the bathroom and the shower holder was falling apart. For the price we paid, we expected a bit more.

Food - We did not have dinners at the hotel, but the breakfast was good, good continental and cooked choice, however, one morning I had Eggs Florentine and were pretty awful.

Parking - There is parking available at the back of the hotel, for an extra charge of £5 / night.

Overall is a good hotel, the price reflects the location of the hotel, not the quality.",Date of stay: March 2013,Mercure Salisbury White Hart Hotel,1,"Salisbury, United Kingdom"
Fantastic little place,"We stopped there one evening to have a few drinks and a bite to eat.
I had the butternut squash soup and my wife had the salmon platter which was enough for 2, both were delicious.
The atmosphere was chilled, the barman and Mike (the owner) were very friendly and chatty.
We will definitely return.",Date of visit: March 2013,Market Inn Salisbury,1,"Salisbury, United Kingdom"
Brilliant,"We loved our stay at Christina, Christina and Maikis went out of their way to please everyone, very friendly people and amazing hosts.
When we arrived there was a bottle of water in the fridge for us and a small bottle of wine... pleasantly surprised by it, as was hot and we had no water left
All rooms have sea view, safe, air conditioning, very well equipped kitchen, fridge with a small freezer (good to freeze a bottle of water for the beach).
The rooms were spotless, cleaned regular, bed sheets and towels changed regular and the apartment is well maintained.
At the back of the garden is a built bbq which you are more than welcome to use, a bag of charcoal is about €6.50 at the minimarket.
The place is very quiet, loved spending the evenings at candle light on the balcony, having a chat or just listening to the waves and the crickets.

The beach is quite pebbly, so a pair of beach shoes will be great, they are about €7 at the shop... The sun loungers are quite cheap, €6 for a set which is 2 sun loungers and 1 umbrella.
A couple of meters from the shore is all sand, but it's a pain to get in without the beach shoes... also it goes deep after 7-10meters, ok for snorkelling at both ends of it.

Quite a few restaurants on the beach, but we preffered Lorrain's Magic Hill, they have their own meats (sheeps, pigs & goats run free on their land in the mountain), free range chicken & eggs, home made feta cheese, olive oil, fresh backed delicious bread rolls, and all the veg is seasonal and fresh picked on the day from one of their 5 gardens.... the food is absolutely amazing, my favourite were char-grilled suckling pig, moussaka, baked feta cheese, kataif and the list is long... loved all their food :o)

Prices... At Lorraine's Magic Hill you can get a main for under €10, 1litre of home made wine for €9 and large beer draft for I think €3.50 or so.

Overall Christina's Studio Apartments are amazing, and we'll definitely return next year",Date of stay: June 2011,Christina Studios,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Amazing,"Absolutely amazing...
The hotel is amazing, as someone said, the reception hall is breath taking...
The food is great and can satisfy even the most fussier eater, plenty for everybody... and the waiters nice and friendly...
The room was spotless, cleaned daily, nice balcony, the only problem will be if you want to watch the tv... except Euronews, CNN and a couple of other news channels, there's no channel in english.
The gardens are amazing... take a couple of hours to wander around them, it's well worthed.

If you want a quiet and cool place for a lovely coffee, then just cross the road from the recetion to the Shopping Centre, go towards the supermarket Dine and just before it are some stairs going down, there is the EL ENCUENTRO Bar... Manolo and his family will more then welcome you... every evening from 9pm is karaoke night, and if you want to have a good laugh, ask Manolo to do the monkey song :o) You can also have a lovely Pepito and the spirits are not served by measure, but by eye and usual are pretty generous quantities.

If you want to go for a nice meal, we recommend the restaurant ""COFRADIA PESCADORES""... it's in the harbor on the way to the light house... you can't miss it, during the day is packed with locals and quiet in the evening... top quality food and without any exagaration, we had the best fish dish in ages...

Next year we will return...",Date of stay: June 2008,Hotel Cordial Mogan Playa,1,"Gran Canaria, Spain"
Be aware,"Completely disappointed!

We knew that the apartment was basic... but even basic has got a limit! Here is a list of what was wrong...

1. Above the pillows was a plug, a light switch, and a hole with wires sticking out (when complained, we were told to don't worry because are dead wires).

2. The fridge door was collapsed; we used a bottle cap to lift it up at an almost closed position to keep the food.

3. Bathroom taps (sink and shower) were corroded as if someone put acid on them and were green.

4. There was nothing to hang the shower handle on, had to hold it with one hand.

5. The shower hose was damaged.

6. One light bulb needed replacing, but it wasn't.

7. The stove (which we thought at first glance that is a microwave) was corroded and the oven not working.

8. The beds and pillows absolutely STANK of sweat, and I could feel all the springs in the mattress.

9. No safe in room (we were told it has been stolen).

10. No hot water till about 10am.

11. We were in room number 1 which is next to the swimming pool; pool table and bar... don't expect to rest till 3am.

12. We had to pay 15 Euro for a ventilator, as we were on the ground floor and couldn't leave the windows open over night.

It's a shame, as the owners are lovely people... but still... that doesn't make up for the conditions.

As for Libra Holidays... they are not going to do anything, as we didn't complain at the rep (which we seen only twice in a week). We arrived very late as the flight was delayed for 6 hours and we just wanted to go to bed, later the rep was nowhere to be found

We will ever go back to Irida?

NEVER... as someone else said... you go once, but then you know better for next year.",Date of stay: September 2007,Irida Chic Boutique Hotel & Spa,1,"Crete, Greece"
