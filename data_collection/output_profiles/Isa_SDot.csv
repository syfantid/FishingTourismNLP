Beautifull beach with free sunbeds and umbrellas,"One of our favorite beaches on Kefalonia. Clean beach (pebbles), clear water, many fishes. Big plus: the free sunbeds and umbrellas.",Date of experience: September 2019,Antisamos Beach,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Private tour,"Due to the late season, we were so lucky that Maria and the Captain gave us a private tour, just for the two of us. The tour started with a delicous breakfast during the way out to the sea to get the 1 km long fishing net. Some of the rare sea turtles greeted us on our way. Afterwards, the catch was inspected. The fishing net has a special size to catch the really huge and tasty shrimps. At a lonesome beach, that is only accessable by boat, we made a stop for swimming (about one hour). The lunch was prepared fresh and live on the boat.

Some maybe important facts:
toilette available on the boat
shadow on the boat thanks to awnings
lonesome and lovely beaches accessed by boat (dry feet) or, if preferred, by swimming
possibility to take a freshwater shower on the boat
tasty breakfast along with coffee
lunch composed of the catch of the day: fried fresh fish and huge shrimps accompanied by noodles and greek salat fruits as dessert
beverages included: we were served plenty of water, lemonade, beer, wine and ouzo
the price is reasonable and an awesome deal for the quality of this unique experience.

To summarize, we had a lovely day with Maria and the Captain and we are happy we had the opportunity to spend the day with them on the fishing boat.",Date of experience: September 2019,Poseidon Fishing Tourism Kefalonia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
