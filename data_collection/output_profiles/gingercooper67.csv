Relaxing Oasis in the Old Town,"We stayed 19th June for a week. If you want to immerse yourself in the old Town this is a perfect base . Our duplex was perfect for two and great to relax in on a hot afternoon , then straight out of the door in the evening to some fab little bars away from the busy area. Rhodes Old Town is amazing and you can easily spend a week exploring . Lena was a fantastic host providing an excellent breakfast in the quiet courtyard always able to answer any questions and helped on a couple of occasions making phone calls . We instantly relaxed at Petrino , we could have used the kitchen but chose to eat out mostly as so much on offer . Our bed was really comfy and we enjoyed everything about the apartment. Fresh towels and bed made every day .",Date of stay: June 2019,Petrino Boutique Hotel,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Money well spent,"We went out on Makarounas boat today ,fishing was great fun followed by swimming and then fabulous Greek Salad , Fresh fish from barbecue lovely bread and Melon to follow . There was cold drinks always available water and wine . The trip was perfect and such good value . I struggled a bit with my rod but help was at hand . We were out 5 hours and were so chilled on our return . Would definitely recommend. Thank you",Date of experience: June 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Perfect pie,"The best steak and Mushroom pie I‚Äôve had in ages . My husband had chicken wings to start then the sliced Lamb which he enjoyed. We shared the Lemon and Lime cheesecake . Staff were very polite and efficient. We had 3 diet Pepsi‚Äôs and the bill was ¬£32 , very good value in our opinion . Spotted someone having fish which looked very good so will return to try it another day .",Date of visit: March 2019,LEGS OF MAN,4,"Sandbach, United Kingdom"

Coasteering,"Had such an amazing afternoon with Pat and Greg , right out of my comfort zone but felt so safe so went for it, jumping from the rocks into the sea has to be done once in a lifetime although I think we‚Äôll be back for more !!

Just perfect,"Arrived following a shopping trip not knowing what I wanted, Bruce very quickly gave us samples of current Beers all of which were so good.

Playing Virus,We were a group of 5 Ladies ( yes its true) two had been before. We all really enjoyed losing ourselves for an hour and although we didn't get out of the room in the time given we were really pleased with what we did and determined to come back and smash it next time. Nathan was great at explaining everything without giving to much away. A great way to spend an hour before drinks and food in Manchester.,Date of experience: June 2016,Breakout Manchester,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Great stay in London,"We paid ¬£69 for a twin room as a base to go to a gig at Brixton academy , We couldn't fault it . The 196 bus takes you to Brixton and back .
