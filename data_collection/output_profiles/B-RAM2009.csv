Best Restaurant in Rhodes,"Been visiting this restaurant since it opened and it never fails to disappoint. Huge portions so make sure you have your elastcated shorts on !
Staff always remember us and are wonderfully hospitable.",Date of visit: July 2018,Mponiatis,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
Truely lovely trip,"We had read the reviews on here about this trip and set about finding it when we arrived in Rhodes harbour, passing big charters all trying to lure you in, then just as we thought we were never going to find it, there it was at the very end of the harbour.
We booked a few days prior and paid our deposit.
The trip itself was just lovely. Starting with a short trip viewing the old town from the harbour, then after a short journey on to fishing in a couple of different spots with plenty of shade and cold drinks on hand bobbing along with the crew on hand for much needed advice on catching fish.
From there a swimming stop in crystal clear waters while the lovely crew cooked up the days catch, which was delicious.
Highly recommended we will definitely be back",Date of experience: July 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
