0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bardsey123,September 2019,5,A magical day!,"An absolute must for anyone visiting Kephalonia even if you are not into fishing! Efi, Dimitrios and Mohammed are fantastic people who went out of their way to make every part of our trip enjoyable. Greeted with coffee, tea and pastries we set off to sail down the coast. We watched the hauling in of the fishing nets and the preparation of the fish, drinking refreshing tasty home made lemonade. We then had a swim in a beautiful bay before sailing further down the coast for another swim whilst Efi cooked the fish and prepared lunch. The highlight of this second swim was dipping into a pool of clay at the end of the beach and covering ourselves in this elixir of youth!! We all swore we looked 10 years younger afterwards!!! The very best part of the day came with the consumption of beautifully cooked fish with salad, potatoes and bread washed down with really good home made red wine, bliss on a plate! The company was really convivial and it made for one of the best days of our holiday.…"

Helping to take fish from the nets, then 2 swimming stops, then a lovely lunch prepared by Efi from the fish caught plus salads and wine etc. This was one of the best days of our holiday in Katelios, Kefalonia. Thank you Dimitrios and Efi, and Mohammed the crew man.…"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ramallah123,September 2019,5,Best day of my holiday. Fishing and eating with great hosts,"Such a wonderful day spent with Efi, Dimitrios and Mohammed on their fishing cruise. The experience is one I shall never forget. Swimming in the small secluded bays. Great company. The fish we caught in the nets were the best fish I have ever eaten all cooked by Efi. Served with lemon potatoes and salad and washed down with red wine, beer or soft drinks. Our hosts were exceptional. I cannot wait until next year so I can do it all again. Thank you for the best day of my holiday. A*** all the way 💕…"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y1422ASsusank,September 2019,5,Magical Fishing Cruise,"Getting down with the locals...... Well, what a perfect day spent with the wonderful, charismatic Efi and husband Dimitrios.   Together with the fisherman of few words, Mohammed (but when he spoke, his words were kind and full of wisdom). It was magic watching him work those nets.   It was a day of fun, wonder, relaxation and laughter, gently cruising the coastline of Kefalonia.  We stopped a few times to haul in the fishing nets and those who wanted to helped free the vast assortment of fish and crustaceans from the nets.  A real education for a complete novice like me.    So we continued, anchoring twice to swim in exotic coves that were almost inaccessible by land.  Meanwhile,  Efi magically conjured up the most delicious  barbecued seafood feast, accompanied with local fresh salad and Efi’s secret recipe of buttery lemon potatoes.  Not to mention carafes of local wine and fresh fruit.....  Amazing how sharing good food and a few glasses of wine can unite strangers into friendship, united by such a splendid experience!     Saying goodbye was hard.  The end of a memorable day, feeling very happy and content.  Very thankful to all three of our perfect hosts.…"

It’s a great experience to learn how to haul fishing nets in and about the array of fish caught. The day started with the most amazing cookies and coffee and a very friendly welcome.  Then it’s time to haul the nets, once all of the nets are in you stop of for a swim stop. while the fish are being cooked for lunch, which was amazing so tasty and the home brewed wine went down a treat.  Information about the different spots/places on the way which is a really nice touch.   I really can’t rate this trip highly enough and if your wanting something different to the normal boat trips this is definitely for you.  We received a lovely welcome and they couldn’t do enough for you.   Will definitely be booking the trip again when we are back to this beautiful Island.…"
