We loved it!,We went for 10 days in August and we loved this place. The garden was marvelous and the pool absolutely amazing! The view the atmosphere the spirit of calmness and nature is absolutely perfect and better that it looks on the pictures. Also the whole family of the hosts are so kind and discreet. We would definitely go again. In our case (a family of 3 for 10 days) the choice of the basement wasn’t the perfect one. But for a young couple or a short stay is great.,Date of stay: August 2019,Podere Raffanna Ecologic House,4,"Massa e Cozzile, Italy"
Excellent food and service!,"We liked a lot this place after 3 not so good choices in Lucca. The food is really good (fish fillet excellent! And nice tagliatta) and the people very nice and friendly. We sit outside but also inside the atmosphere is very nice. We didn’t like that much tiramisu, I wouldn’t suggest this dessert in this restaurant.",Date of visit: August 2019,Osteria da Rosolo,4,"Lucca, Italy"

Amazing view and nice food!,The view is fantastic and the food is really nice. I suggest to make a reservation before you go there. I loved the pasta with porcini!,Date of visit: August 2019,Casorino,4,"Massa e Cozzile, Italy"
Excellent experience especially for kids!,It is small though it is really nice. It is in the woods and this makes the experience much better. The animals look better in such a natural environment compare to other more artificial zoos. I strongly recommend it if you have young kids.,Date of experience: August 2019,Giardino Zoologico di Pistoia,4,"Pistoia, Italy"
Medium food and service,"It is not bad but it isn’t something special. There was a big delay to serve our dishes. We eat a carbonara that wasn’t good, a pizza that was ok and a pesto that was bad.",Date of visit: August 2019,Osteria Parlascio,4,"Lucca, Italy"
Fantastic! Strongly recommended!,A great experience for everyone! I strongly recommend it by feet or by bike. It’s a fantastic experience!,Date of experience: August 2019,Le mura di Lucca,4,"Lucca, Italy"
Not a good choice,The atmosphere and the people were nice. Nevertheless the food was really poor and the service as well.,Date of visit: August 2019,Ristorante Pizzeria K2,4,"Lucca, Italy"
"great place, disappointing service","i enjoyed my stay at La Bagnaia because this place is fantastic due to the surrounding, the nature, the calmness, the view and this village feeling. The rooms are very spacious and the breakfast really nice. Nevertheless the personnel of this hotel makes a lot of effort to ruin your experience they are actually impolite and this is the only bad thing to comment for the hotel. We were a big group of business people and everyone was commenting the rudeness of the employees. Disappointing. However I would go again if I had the chance because I like the landscape.",Date of stay: September 2018,"La Bagnaia Golf & Spa Resort Siena, Curio Collection by Hilton",4,"Bagnaia, Italy"

Excellent choice!,"Perfect position, great cosy atmosphere, very unique retro style/concept. All people are very friendly and professional, and provide an excellent service.",Date of visit: June 2016,Oineas Restaurant,4,"Athens, Greece"
Excellent dinner!!!!,A really nice place! Excellent atmosphere and decoration. Really good and friendly service. Unforgettable tastes! Inspired by Greek recipes but with an international twist. I would recommend it for a romantic dinner or a business dinner.,Date of visit: November 2015,Aleria,4,"Athens, Greece"
It looks better than it tastes,Nice atmosphere but very average taste. The menu is quite poor. The ravioli were really nice but ragu very bad. It is a nice place to be for a wine but the food is not something special.,Date of visit: November 2015,Inside Restaurant and Cocktail Bar,4,"Turin, Italy"
Beyond my expectations!,"Comparing to other Mercury hotels, this was much better! Really nice rooms, good amenities, tasteful breakfast. Better than I expected! The area is not good, but few meters is the very nice central road with all the shops etc, so position is very convenient to walk around in the center.",Date of stay: November 2015,Best Western Crystal Palace Hotel,4,"Turin, Italy"
Disappointed,The position is perfect. The architecture is great. The room is spacious and impressive but very terribly cleaned. I found hair everywhere in the bathroom. It seemed cleaned but obviously the cleaning equipment was dirty and full of hair That spread everywhere. Also from a 5 star hotel I expect to have slippers and facial which they do not provide. It is a pity for such a gifted place to be destroyed by the lack of hygiene standards.,Date of stay: November 2015,Grand Hotel Plaza,4,"Rome, Italy"
I love this place!,"Perfect village perfect position perfect hotel! We had excellent time, it is nice and quiet ideal for couples. The breakfast and dinner were fantastic! We loved it! Though it is away from the beach is an excellent choice for sifnos. The service in the restaurant could have been better but still it was a very nice place.",Date of stay: August 2015,Smaragdi Hotel,4,"Sifnos, Greece"
