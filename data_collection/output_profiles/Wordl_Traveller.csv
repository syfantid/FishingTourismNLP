Very disappointed. No music/ entertainment as website suggests,"Very disappointed. Booked a leaving party here for 12 people. Website suggested music and staff entertainment but all we got was elevator music all night. The waiter/waitress service was abysmal. Service was slow and inattentive and the waiting staff were so unfriendly and evidently didn’t want to be there.
The food was basic. Hummus and snacks (not enough) for starters and then after an hour’s wait we got the main course. It was embarrassing as I had organised the restaurant for the group based upon its website but it was just awful.",Date of visit: December 2019,Sarastro,1,"London, United Kingdom"
This is a “Must Do” if you are in Kefalonia,"Run by the two nicest people in Greece - Dimitris and Efi. We had the best day! We started at 8am from Kefalonia Harbour and set out to pull in the fishing nets that had been set the night before. Kids were Uber excited as we pulled in Parrot fish, bass, bream, mullet, Scorpion fish, squid and cuttlefish plus more - and everyone helped.
Then went to a deserted beach for swimming and discovered a hidden gem... natural mineral-rich clay which we plastered all over our bodies before swimming back to the boat for a FANTASTIC meal of the fish we’d caught plus fresh vegetables from Efi’s and Dimitrios’ garden all washed down by their excellent home made wine!
My 14year old daughter described it as “the best day of my life”
Enough said!
I really recommend it!

Used to be better,"Visited for dinner recently. Seemed less welcoming than previous years and service was not as good. It was difficult to attract a waiter once food had been served and we waited 20 mins for our check at the end of the evening.
Still a nice place and the fish is good - surprisingly doesn’t serve any of the usual Greek cuisine.
The opening of Cozy just up the road has raised the bar. Here, service was excellent and sophisticated. Captain Jerry’s has to up its game!",Date of visit: August 2018,Captain Jerry's,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Up-market restaurant in the heart of Katelios,"White linen on the tables, nicely set with glasses and cutlery (none of this knife and fork wrapped in a paper napkin) and very reasonable. Food was excellent. Service was impeccable. It really felt like this restaurant appreciated our custom.
I would have liked to see Dolmades or fried zucchini on the menu (maybe I didn’t look hard enough..) but that’s my only gripe!
Great restaurant. We will go back.",Date of visit: August 2018,Cozy,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Practical but no frills hotel,"There are several Foss Hotels in or near Reykjavík and this review refers to Foss Hotel Reykjavík. It is a very clean and functional hotel. Rooms are small with a very narrow wardrobe for hanging clothes. It has a small fridge and a kettle for tea/coffee as well as an iron/ironing board and hairdryer. There is no pool, no gym nor anything other amenity. It does have a bar. The Restaurant is nice but it is buffet-style.
It is close to the water but it’s not really accessible. The walk into the town for restaurants and shopping is about 15 mins and quite pleasant walk.
There are hardly any hotels in Reykjavik with spas or interior pools (an outside pool would be impractical as it’s too cold and windy).
All in all a nice hotel but I was expecting more until I realised this is the standard in Reykjavik for 4/5 star hotels.",Date of stay: July 2018,Fosshotel Reykjavik,1,"Reykjavik, Iceland"
Great attraction. Clean and well run.,"This is one of the classic places to visit. Take the luxury package with robe, towel, slippers etc

Only disconcerting thing about the place is that the changing room (either male or female) are not at all private so be expected to strip down to the basics in full view of everyone. !! There is even a notice telling everyone to shower before entering the lagoon but another spa warns you that you must remove all swimwear before going in the communal showers!! For those of you who are shy - beware! There are a few cubicles at the back of the communal showers so you can bypass the communal ones and try to find one of these but there are only a dozen or so.

All in all it was a pleasant attraction and only 45 mins from central Reykjavik.",Date of experience: July 2018,Hreyfing Heilsulind,1,"Reykjavik, Iceland"
Lovely Italian restaurant in the centre of the town,"Þingholtsstræti 1
101 Reykjavík
Iceland

This is an unpretentious but classy restaurant at the Old Harbour end of the main shopping street in Reykjavik. The ambience was pleasant, the staff were excellent and the food was the best we’d had in the entire week we’d been in town (and we’d dined at numerous expensive high-end restaurants). The price was very reasonable.
The prawns in spices as a starter was a little too oily and could have done with more garlic but my main course of mushroom risotto was phenomenal! My wife had a lasagne and salad and loved it.
It’s one of the lesser known restaurants but I would go back tomorrow. Enjoy!",Date of visit: July 2018,Caruso,1,"Reykjavik, Iceland"
Nice hotel. Very centrally located but perhaps too central!,"I booked a 3 night stay. It was a very nice hotel with plenty of amenities. It was in the very centre of Sukhumvit and literally joined to the metro by a walkway which also joined you to the shopping centre on the other side of the road.
It felt very much like. Business hotel that was in a very very busy part of town. There wasn’t anything “Thai” about it. I was upset to see that having made the reservation on booking.com they deducted the value of the full 3 night stay £800 from my credit card when I arrived and then when I checked out, they charged me the same amount again! I called them from my taxi to the airport when my credit card company sent me an alert for a charge of 2 x £800 ! They told me this was standard practice and that I shouldn’t worry because the £800 would be credited in “a few weeks”!! I was so mad as I didn’t see why the Sheraton should benefit from charging me twice and holding onto my money for a few weeks!

The next time I went to Bkok I stayed at Le Meridien, Sathorn which was fantastic, cheaper, classier, better located and didn’t rip me off.",Date of stay: April 2018,"Sheraton Grande Sukhumvit, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Bangkok",1,"Bangkok, Thailand"
Nice hotel. Pleasant location on the Marina,"Stayed 2 nights. Pleasant outlook onto the marina and the boats therein. Short 15 min stroll to the marina dining area in the evenings.
Hotel is clean and well run. Big choice at breakfast. My only complaint is that on the 2 days I was there I had to shower in cold/warm water until I discovered you have to run the water for a good 10 mins before you want to shower before it gets hot and that the shower heat controls needs to be positioned just right off mid-centre... such a waste of water!(and I was only on the 2nd Floor)",Date of stay: July 2018,Herods Herzliya,1,"Herzliya, Israel"
Terrible - no room for me despite confirmation,I booked this hotel because it was near to my company’s Paris office. We had experienced problems before when this hotel overbooked their rooms and so had to turn away some of our staff. This time it happened to me. They came up with a cock-and-bull story about several rooms being damaged and as such they could not accommodate me BUT they had booked me into a Mercure hotel in a gritty part of Paris a 15 mom taxi drive away!! This hotel is unprofessional and should not be trusted even if you have a confirmed booking. Avoid it like the plague!,Date of stay: July 2018,Hotel Paris Neuilly,1,"Neuilly-sur-Seine, France"
Adult dining in club-like atmosphere,"Food good but expensive for what it is. The crispy chicken was excellent. Glass of house wine £40.
Dark and club-like atmosphere with music a little too loud to talk comfortably. Have live entertainment of scantily clad ladies - which then appears on your bill as “ entertainment” at £15 a head - even if you didn’t want entertainment or like me, wasn’t expecting it.
Service good and staff very nice but to me this place caters for either people on an expense account or foreign wealthy guests trying to impress younger women.",Date of visit: April 2018,Park Chinois,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Hidden gem!! Far better value than many other acquariums,This is more than an Acquarium so don't try comparing it to the SeaWorlds etc or you will be disappointed. It's a small intimate learning facility which my kids loved. They saw the Sharks being fed and loved the exhibits. Take the boat tour which is pleasant (just 1 hour) very interactive and educational.,,Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium,1,"Sarasota, Florida"
It was pretty dull ...,I expected a less commercialised Gatorland but was disappointed. It's about an hour from Longboat Key and frankly not worth the trip. Entrance to the park is just $6 for the car and once inside there's not much to do other than take a walking trail or take the boat tour of the lake which costs extra (about $20 per person I seem to recall). Once in the boat you go Alligator viewing but all we saw were the heads of alligators which dropped underwater when we approached so much of the tour focused on bird viewing. The kids were bored and once we disembarked we left and drive home. Sorry! Nice peaceful place but this ain't a wild animal safari!,,Myakka River State Park,1,"Sarasota, Florida"
Nice but flawed,"This is a very nice resort where the staff are very attentive and the rooms are nice but they could do a few things to improve it:
1. Most sea view rooms look out over the beach and the swimming pool. The swimming pool is open till late( supposedly 8pm but there were lots of people in the pool way after 9 pm). When all you want to do is relax and have a quiet drink before dinner overlooking the Gulf this is spoiled by the noise of shrieking kids (I have 2 of my own) in the pool and teenagers in the hot tub. Please management.... Shut the pool by 7pm and have staff make sure no-one is using it!

2. Wanna get a sun-bed by the beach. Forget it unless a) you wake at 6am and go down to ""reserve"" a bed or b) bribe the beach attendants with a big tip for the week and they will reserve you beds in the front row and you can turn up at noon if you want to! Management... Please pay the attendants enough so they don't have to accept bribes or stop them from reserving beds for guests who haven't had the decency to come to the beach to reserve them. This really spoiled our vacation.

3. The hotel adds 18% service charge on everything and then expects you to add a further tip
Management ... Please put an end to this.",Date of stay: April 2015,Resort at Longboat Key Club,1,"Longboat Key, Florida"
Too many people and long long lines,"Nice place to visit but you end up waiting 45 mins minimum for every ride. You can pay an extra $30 per person for fast track tickets which covers the biggest most popular rides but on the day we were visiting they had sold out by 11am
If not for the interminable lines/queues for rides, drinks, snacks i would rate it higher",,Busch Gardens,1,"Tampa, Florida"
Waste of time and money,"Queued up for ages with 2 11 yr olds to part with 66 Euros. Aquarium was average and far inferior to aquariums in other major cities. There was no allowance made for non-French speakers as all descriptions, explanations and films were solely in French without any hint of a sub-title or translation. As the aquarium is marketed to tourists who pay the exorbitant entrance price they could at least make sole allowance for other nationalities.
My kids hated it. Couldn't wait to leave.",,Aquarium de Paris - CineAqua,1,"Paris, France"
Ignore you if you are not French,Nice enough French bistro - keep you waiting forever to order whilst they serve everyone else who is remotely French. Food is ok. If you come here you have to slam the table and demand to be served!! Not to be recommended for the faint of heart.,,le petit villiers chez Fred,1,"Paris, France"
Not as good as I'd expected,"I had visited the San Diego Safari Park the day before and found it much better than the zoo. My Californian friends urged me to visit the zoo but my entire family was disappointed and we left after 2 hours. I have been to far better zoos. My criticisms are:
- animal enclosures are woefully small. The Zoo might have been leading edge 20 years ago when it no longer kept animals in cages but nowadays people feel sorry to see wolves, tigers, lions confined in such small ""open spaces"". My younger daughter was in tears when she saw some animals pacing backward and forwards in enclosures too small for them.
- it is too commercial. There are more shops selling stuffed animals than there are exhibits
- not particularly educational. The 2 theatres they have are used for cartoon 4D shows, which have no educationAl basis whatsoever and are designed simply to extract more money from hapless tourists.
- exhibits very spread out and many of little consequence (who wants to see ducks or goats!!).
On a positive note. They don't charge you to park your car.

Overall, my recommendation if you have limited time in SD is to forget the zoo and go to the Safari Park instead.",,San Diego Zoo,1,"San Diego, California"
Poor food and unfriendly waitress,Visited recently with my family. Food was not impressive - small portions and poor quality (children's chicken nuggets were small balls of 70% breadcrumbs). Waitress needs to attend a course in customer service. She didn't smile once and at the end of the meal when told that one of the meals was in edible she said nothing and all but shrugged and walked away. We won't go back.,,The Frog at Skirmett,1,"Skirmett, United Kingdom"
Fantastic pub atmosphere,This is a well-run archetypal English pub on the village green. The food is excellent and the service is polite and homely.,Date of visit: April 2014,The George on The Green,1,"Holyport, United Kingdom"
"Pretentious, way over-priced and food very average","Table staff were overbearing and snooty. No kids menu. £75 minimum for a main course (kids or adult). Kept serving pretentious ""tasters"" between courses which were unpleasant and somehow used to justify ridiculous prices",Date of visit: May 2014,Ossiano,1,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
Nothing to it!,"This place took my family 10 mins to idle through and it was nice but nothing special. Entry was free for my family as we were staying at Atlantis a Hotel but I would have been peeved if I had queued to go in and had to pay a hefty entrance fee.
I honestly can't see for the life of me why this would draw such huge reviews other than if it was the hotel itself that was writing them... Improbable I know ... but honestly this was a non-event and a waste of time.",Date of experience: May 2014,The Lost Chambers Aquarium,1,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
£150 for a family of 4 for a buffet!! Please!,"My family and I queued to get in for 40 mins. We would have gone elsewhere but every restaurant had long queues to get in (we had only just arrived so didn't know we had to book!).
Once we got to the front of the queue the maître d took our rom number and informed us it was £50 per adult and £25 for children excluding drinks! When we got in... It was crowded and the food was mass-produced like any buffet - except for the fact this also had oysters and sashimi included which was great.
If you were on a meal plan this might have been bearable but the prices for buffet food spoiled it for us.",Date of visit: May 2014,Saffron,1,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
Not worth the drive from San Fran unless you are A tree-lover,"The park is a 3 hour drive from San Francisco but once you get to the Gate you have to drive a further 1 hour to get to the ""Yosemite Village"" at the base of the valley. It was pretty but all we saw were trees... Lots of the...and when you've seen one sequoia tree.....
The views of the mountains were nice. Didn't see any wildlife. All in all it was a pleasant enough day out but I regretted spending 8 hours in a car (4 hrs there and back) to see a pretty ordinary park. I wasted a day in my opinion when I could have done more in San Francisco itself. Don't go with kids.. they will be bored out of their minds... Sorry to sound so negative but I wish someone had told me what I am telling you before I set off.",Date of experience: July 2013,Yosemite Valley,1,"Yosemite National Park, California"
Great hotel next to the Falls,Great location overlooking Snake River with lovely patio area for drinks overlooking river. Staff v friendly. Great breakfast. Everything you could need from a hotel. They have a nice pool - shame it wasn't open-air but I guess it's better to have an all year round facility rather than a pool you can just use in the summer. Nonetheless the pool was bright and airy and overlooked the river.,Date of stay: July 2013,Hilton Garden Inn Idaho Falls,1,"Idaho Falls, Idaho"
Phenomenal resort,"I cannot praise this resort enough - particularly the Busakorn wing whe we stayed which is away from the main road.
From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff. My wife was not feeling well and in the elevator on our way to the room, the bellboy commented on it and asked if he could help. We declined but nonetheless, 10 mins later there was a knock on the door and the hotel nurse appeared. Se was incredibly helpful and gave me a prescription to take to the nearby pharmacy. There was no charge. It was just outstanding customer service from the bellboy who took the initiative, to the nurse who was so charming.
The hotel has 2 large pools. The one in the Busakorn wing is solely for the residents in that wing and it was beautiful and as good or better than most 5 star hotels I've stayed at.
The restaurants were the biggest surprise. We had previously stayed in Bangkok at the Mandarin Oriental but the Holiday Inn in Patong was far far superior in every way. Having eaten at ""Namh"", ""Vertigo"", and ""Breezes"" ( all top world-class restaurants in Bangkok) I was surprised to find that ""Sams"" restaurant at the Holiday Inn was comparable in terms of food quality, presentation, choice and service. it's a place to go for a special night out without the kids. ""Sea Breezes"" , the Thai restaurant at the hotel was also top notch and excellent quality.
The beach is literally across the road and the shops are all within a minute or so's walk.
This hotel is great value for money. Great for families or couples. Couples should pay the extra and ask to stay at the Busakorn wing.",Date of stay: April 2013,Holiday Inn Resort Phuket,1,"Phuket, Thailand"
Don't go!,"I visited with my young children and from the moment we arrived it became clear this was a rip-off with the sole intention of extracting as much cash as possible from tourists. I was immediately singled out as easy prey as my husband was not with us. One of the employees, dressed as a pirate, whose name was ""Jason"" shadowed me to the point of harassment continually whispering to me ""I hope you will show your appreciation for the staff milady.."". I told him to leave me alone but he persisted. It was very intimidating and it spoiled the entire day for me. I wish I had complained to management but it seemed, from talking to other visitors, that this was the 'norm' for this venue. From the moment you paid the entrance fee, you had to pay for everything else as an extra. The venue itself was small and very unprofessional. I have read the reviews of the Ocho Rios location and it seems that the Negril location is a lot different.
They only had 4 poor dolphins and the actual ""experience"" with them in the water was under 20 mins.",Date of experience: February 2013,Dolphin Cove Montego Bay,1,Jamaica
Disappointed - too British!,"I chose the Lindos Mare after reading so many positive reviews on TripAdvisor but the hotel did not live up to my expectations nor those of my wife and children. In summary, the Lindos Mare is a ""Brit Haven"" with over 70% of the guests British and the rest predominantly from Italy. As a result, our Greek holiday entailed us being surrounded by loud, beer-swilling, tatooed Englishmen wearing the ""Cross of St George"" and huddled around the bar drinking lager from 9:00am till late. It felt like being at a Millwall football club convention. The hotel is a haven for English weddings (wedding just about every day during summer) which accounts for the large groups of Brits arriving en masse.

The pros and cons of the hotel, to be fair are as follows;

PROS:
i) Very well appointed rooms, very clean with breathtaking views over the Bay
ii) Food was surprisingly good and plentiful with plenty of choice. The a la Carte retaurant - the Pelagos - had a nice atmosphere but limited menu and very slow service
iii)Staff were very friendly
iv) Entertaininment was provided most nights

CONS:
i) It was impossible to get a sunbed near around the pool unless you got up at 6:00am and ""reserved"" a lounger with your towel - by which time most were reserved anyway. There are not enough sunbeds
ii) The beach was described as ""sandy"". Its a long downhill trek to the beach (using 4 different lifts) which is a dirty brown/gray colour and covered with very small stones and fine coarse gravel - not pleasant to walk in. Nearest golden sandy beach is at Lindos itself but trying to park in the town is stressful and the beach, although excellent, is more crowded than Blackpool on a Bank Holiday.
iii) Too British.
iv) Too many steps.",Date of stay: August 2007,Lindos Mare Hotel,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
