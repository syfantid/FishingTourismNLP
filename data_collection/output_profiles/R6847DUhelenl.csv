A brilliant day at the beautiful apiary with Eleni and Thanasis,"Please visit this amazing place - gorgeous surroundings and such clever little bees with lovely hosts. Thanasis has been doing this for decades and he is clearly devoted to these much maligned insects.
You get to see the hives once you donne all the gear and the bees are not aggressive - I was quite calm for someone who hates wasps!!!
The honey is made predominantly from the thyme and the black fir trees and it's to die for !!!! We tasted pollen and royal jelly and discovered the virtues of propolis. We bought a load of jars home.
Their home is truly idyllic and it's only 10 minutes from the airport so it's easy to do on the last day of the holiday (as we did) - but IGNORE THE MAP ON TRIP ADVISOR - you'll never get there - Use google maps !!!! I admire these lovely bees even more than I already did xxxx",Date of experience: September 2016,Dias Beekeeping,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Brilliant day trip with amazing hosts,"Found on trip advisor and booked 2 days before with VERY quick responses from Antonia. Arrived at Agia Pelagia where Mr Michalouras moors the boat. Greeted with homemade cake and coffee. Mustafa from Egypt helps to bring in the fish on long lines while we watched. Squid and lobster and fish all prepped on the boat and cooked in the galley. Fresh potato salad - capers dill and parsley really lifted the flavours of the beautiful fish,and the pasta got a thumbs up from the Italians so must be good !! Jump into turquoise sea and swim or sit back and enjoy the sun. Nicky was very helpful and entertained the other children. REALLY RECOMMEND this trip !!!! Coming back next year with our kids- already booked the flights xxxxx efkharisto Antonia and Michal !!!!!

Fantastic trip with lovely hosts,Dimitris and Effi are part of the new fishing tourism in Greece - a most interesting way of getting out there to see what life for fishermen entails. Really educational and I'm bringing my children next year - they will love seeing the colourful and varied fish - and lobster- a lot of which is later cooked by the hosts and eaten on the boat. Just come with swimming regalia - and snorkel - jump off the back of the boat into the cerulean waters and you can swim whilst lunch is prepped. Best fish I've tasted and you struggle to find anything fresher. Katelios harbour is easy to find - there's a toilet on the boat - and everything very clean. Message Effi and she promptly replies. The return journey was really exhilarating when Dmitris turns up the engines. I felt a bit sick and Effi had far superior pills on offer than the ones I had at home. Thanks guys !!!!

Lonely planet recommendation - great place !,"Ignore the sea view restaurants and head for Platanos opposite the Lemon tree shop ( lovely gifts here )
Had 2 courses here - agree with previous reviews on the cold meze - it's beautiful and mouthwatering rice stuffed vine leaves - hot grilled goats cheese too - look at my photos of it drizzled in thick balsamic YUMMY
I chose pork souvlaki which were nice but with I had opted for the goat stifado which my husband ate - tender meat off the bone with lovely onions
Anastasis the waiter was helpful and spoke good English . We felt the meal was too cheap for the quality we got so tipped generously. Toilets very clean. Ignore the bad comments - I suspect these were written by people who expect fast food Macdonalds style ;) xxx Family run too .",Date of visit: September 2016,Platanos,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Good food,"A little confused !! Korean and Japanese but they present a "" Chinese"" menu perhaps for the non converted ?! Table next to me ordered crispy duck pancakes and Chinese dishes. Enjoyed sushi and pork Katsu and staff very pleasant. Food VERY quick !!",Date of visit: May 2016,Wokooshii,4,"Stretford, United Kingdom"
Happy accident !!,"Nearly bypassed Fortaleza coming back from cape st Vincent
Really cheap to get in and we spent hours here walking around and taking in the breathtaking, thundering waves which crash against the cliffs.
Limestone paving similar to Malham cove in Yorkshire . Really interesting plants and birds and amazing views of the Atlantic
Saw lots of people turn around without paying the few euros to go in.
There are grottoes where the wind blows in from the sea and a tunnel which harnesses the power of the wind to create a very powerful eerie sound as you walk around.
Loved it !!!",Date of experience: April 2016,Fortaleza de Sagres,4,"Sagres, Portugal"
Lands end,Drove here and there's not much really to see or do unless you are good at walking over rocky terrain. We had a wurst from the last European wurst van-cafe before you reach USA. Theres a lighthouse and you can sit and watch the waves,Date of experience: April 2016,Cape Saint Vincent,4,"Sagres, Portugal"
Olhau market,"Decided to take in the fish market here and spent the best part of an hour looking around. My children were fascinated and although we arrived late morning when stalls already packing up, it was still good and got some great photos of the place. Next door to the fish are fruits and vegetables in beautiful mounds of vivid colours - bought local honey and salt and almonds to bring home. Free entertainment and if you're self catering, the freshest produce you could wish for",Date of experience: April 2016,Mercado de Olhao,4,"Olhao, Portugal"
Simply scrumptious,"Found this in my lonely planet guide. Arrived early and lots of seats - chose indoors which was great as you could see the tanks with crab and lobster.
The best meal was my husbands clam, scallop and prawn ""stew"" in the most delectable tomato and onion sauce - my unsophisticated children chose pizza and lasagne - what a travesty with all those beautiful seafood dishes on offer !! They cleared their plates which says it all really regarding quality.
Staff attentive and friendly.
After an hour the place was heaving and no tables free.
Don't expect posh decor, it's simple and dated but who cares if you enjoy your meal and with 2 children of 9 and 5 years, we felt relaxed and welcomed.
Will definitely visit here again.",Date of visit: April 2016,Restaurante Marisqueira Rui,4,"Silves, Portugal"
Pretty - great views of Silves,It rained but we still walked around the castle - rather quickly as we were drenched. Have been here before and on a sunny day it's lovely to sit and take your surroundings in. Cheap entry fee but fitting as there's not much inside other than the castle walls. Choose a dry day ! Some interesting things to see though.,Date of experience: April 2016,Castelo de Silves,4,"Silves, Portugal"
Super little place,Third trip to Salema and very impressed with Boia and the staff. Sat watching the waves on the beach. Excellent fish soup and calamares. Children ate lamb chops - and the seabass was great. Didn't feel rushed and the atmosphere was pleasant. Used to eat at the hotel Atlantic - also good,Date of visit: April 2016,Boia Bar,4,"Salema, Portugal"
Surf and sand and sun and sea,Drove west again during our recent stay to avoid the rain and the Atlantic coast delivered again. We parked at the top of steep hill and took a short walk to narrow wood steps leading into rocks which you have to balance on the get to the sand for a good 3-4 metres. Surfers love it here. Any facilities involve going back over the rocks. Our children adored it.,Date of experience: April 2016,Arrifana Beach,4,"Aljezur, Portugal"
Jet 2 package holiday 5 stars !!,"I booked this hotel months ago and trip advisor ratings almost put me off but I held my nerve and it's honestly one of the best hotels I've been to. Travelled with my children under - 10 and staff were lovely but could sense some client dissatisfaction at times which is annoying as it's advertised as family friendly and if you want a child free zone then find an adults only hotel. Reception staff were SO helpful and our maid was really good. We emptied the bath one night and the water came up through the floor but maintenance were right on it and staff rang to check it hadn't happened again.
Stayed in 302 junior suite sea view and had a beatiful panorama of the pine cliffs and Falesia beach and the pool- temp of outdoor pool about 19 degrees - indoor 30 average- needless to say we swam inside a lot but we expected this. Falesia pool bar served the most melt in your mouth calamares. Lovely sandwiches and salads and lighter meals . Only ate once at night in hotel at Il Basilico and had beautiful veal. There are lots of nice restaurants outside the resort but we drove to the west most days and ate miles away .
Clean and sparkly Windows and floors and toilet facilities. Good disabled access. You get a prestige card for your next stay and this entitles you to discounts. They are a chain and I'm now very tempted to try sister hotels in Madeira and Brazil xxx thanks Porto bay and see you again",Date of stay: April 2016,Porto Bay Falesia,4,"Albufeira, Portugal"
Secluded awe inspiring beach,"Come here if you simply want sand and sea of the Atlantic roller variety.
Very simple beach hut serving delicious food. In April we saw about 30 people all day and a couple of canines. Access to beach served by a lovely wide wood ramp and steps straight onto soft warm sand. Toilets in the beach hut immaculate. Our children must have ran for miles up and down the shallows. Impressive but dangerous cliffs at the far sides of the beach but there's no need to anywhere near them. The river was about 20 ft across and 1-2 feet deep on the day so kids played in it for ages - not rocky - just a sandy bottom.",Date of experience: April 2016,Praia Da Amoreira,4,"Aljezur, Portugal"
Beautiful Japanese !!!! A must if you're in the algarve,"Spent a week in the Algarve and visited this place twice to introduce our children to Japanese food
5 year old LOVED the teppanyaki chicken and rice and 9 year old sampled succulent beef sirloin and scallops and California maki
Dourada sushi to die for
Brilliant tempura
Extremely talented chef/ owner working with his wife and the lovely Fatima and Edgar - waiter and waitress
They made us so welcome and the teppanyaki is a real show stopper
There are 2 other buffet style Japanese restaurants close by but would only visit Fuji
Thanks guys for 2 really good nights xxxxx",Date of visit: April 2016,Restaurante Japonês Fuji,4,"Albufeira, Portugal"
