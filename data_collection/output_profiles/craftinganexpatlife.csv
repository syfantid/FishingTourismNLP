Breakfast & Seafood buffets - Excellent!,"Breakfast & Seafood buffets both excellent. There were plenty of choices to make even the pickiest eaters happy. Seafood night: cold selection of seafood (like mussels and shrimp), grilled fresh fish, battered/fried fish, Tiger Prawns, lamb stew, beef medallions, ice cream, salads, potatoes, rice, sushi, etc. Breakfast Buffet: omelets, waffles, fruit, salad, sweets, beef bacon. Lots to choose! You were also able to make special requests in case you did not see what you were looking for. For example, on seafood buffet night there was a chef preparing pizzas (I assume on special request). All the staff were extremely attentive, fast and helpful (especially Ismail). The food was served to you very efficiently and safely by the very friendly and helpful chefs. Great experience. Good for families. Awesome seating outside with gorgeous view. Best of all, you didn’t feel rushed - you cold sit back, enjoy and relax.",Date of visit: November 2020,Al Khiran Kitchen,4,"Muscat, Oman"
This is where we take all our visitors. It’s the experience + food + the great $’s + outdoor seating +excellent service.,"I just love this place. In the evening, it’s always bustling with activity in and around this area. It’s one of those places that you can drive up to, honk your car horn, and get service right to your window. We prefer to park and enjoy the ambiance, sit in the outdoor area with the bright red chairs. The menu has a great selection of Middle Eastern type food - shawarmas, Tika Chicken, even pizza for the kids (if they so desire). They also have fresh juice on the menu. You are sure to receive tea with a fresh leaf of mint during your meal too. It seems that this a favourite place for visitors to Muscat and they return each trip to the city. The prices are affordable, the service is quick and food good.",Date of visit: December 2019,Old Turkish Restaurant,4,"Muscat, Oman"
"Love, love, love.","We spent almost three weeks exploring and touring in Greece and saw many things and went on many adventures but I think that this tour was, by far, the most amazing of all. Not only was it highly educational but it was just a good party! It was an interactive tour where you learned about the catch that day as the fish were unraveled from the net, you could touch and hold some of the fish too. I loved that we were able try to fish for ourselves with rods and lines. We could swim around the boat if we wanted to and the freshly cooked meal prepared by the crew was absolutely spectacular. I mean, seriously, the best meal we had our entire three week trip. We loved this amazing adventure and will rememberer it as one of our family’s favorite memories and experiences ever.",Date of experience: June 2019,Giorgaros fishing tours Santorini,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Magical Plankton,"What a cool experience to jump into the water and see the plankton light up all around you. The more you move, the more spectacular it is. I’m sure glad we didn’t cancel due to the rainy weather scattered with lightning and thunder all day long. Thankfully the weather cooperated for our trip and because the cloud cover was so heavy and dark the plankton were exceptionally visible. The atmosphere of the tour was relaxing and enjoyable. We felt very satisfied with the easy-going vibe of the evening tour. Just the right amount of time spent out in the water splashing around and never felt rushed at all. It’s definitely worth the time and the money to experience this while you’re on the island. Too bad you can’t get good pictures of this magical time!",Date of experience: July 2019,Karmakazi,4,"Koh Rong Samloem, Cambodia"
We extended our stay because we loved it so much.,We were attracted to the pool and the view when booking this place for our 4 day stay. I can say for certain that it did not disappoint. It was just the perfect little place to stay with children. The pool was always a good source of entertainment for everyone and the view really was stunning. Paddle boards and kayaks available to use for free. Food was great everyday and in good sized portions. Lots of selection. We loved the hammocks at the resort and wished that there were more of them to use. Could use a squeegee for the bathroom shower to drain the water quicker. Other than that. Just lovely!,Date of stay: July 2019,BOUNTY Boutique,4,"Koh Rong Samloem, Cambodia"
Burgers! Yum!,"What I really want to say is that “the burgers were so good. Enough said. Have one. Thank me later”. That’s all I really want to say but I have to post more characters than that. Lol.

The Spaghetti and Amok are also great. For desert, the brownie is pretty delicious.

Service was spot-on too.",Date of visit: July 2019,Sara Resort Restaurant,4,"Koh Rong Samloem, Cambodia"
"Beautiful view, good food.",Pizza was good. Spaghetti was good. Khmer Salad was also good. Just a beautiful view to enjoy a meal at night. A nice comfortable place with lovely ambiance. I’d recommend this restaurant to others.,Date of visit: July 2019,Cita Pizzeria & Italian Restaurant,4,"Koh Rong Samloem, Cambodia"
Basics Please - hand soap and decent towels!,"I’d probably rate this a 2.5 out of 5 if I could. The bathrooms could use a little work - no hand soap (?). We had to ask for some. Not enough towels and the towels were pretty ripped and ratty - they should invest in some new ones. The water pressure in the showers was weak and you’d have to wait quite a while for hot water. Probably the thing that disturbed me the most was the rust smell of the water.

We were on the second floor of the hotel and I did not see an elevator in the building. Our view sucked and the AC’s made it sound like there was a truck running through our room at night. But, hey, at least they worked!

Wifi worked best in the hallways.

The pool was well occupied all day long.

The restaurant food was good but overpriced for the, sometimes, very small portions. The service was slow too but the breakfast was good with lots of options.

Staff - friendly, pleasant and helpful.

Great location and transportation available just outside the doors (tuk tuks always parked there). Laundry services just outside the hotel too with affordable prices.",Date of stay: July 2019,Central Indochine D'angkor Hotel,4,"Siem Reap, Cambodia"
My new favourite restaurant in Muscat,"It’s a little hidden gem of a restaurant in Muscat. We went on a weekend at 7pm-ish and it was quite busy already but there’s plenty of seating available upstairs and lots of room between the tables to feel quite comfortable. Lots of families there with small children. The service was outstanding. Very, very attentive staff and they were more than happy to serve you. The food - so delicious. We all enjoyed everything we ordered (butter chicken, biryani, vegetarian dishes, naan bread and a couple new-to-the-menu dishes as well) and we were all stuffed when we left. Clean, lovely atmosphere. Really, really enjoyed this place. Oh, and they have home delivery too! Yay.",Date of visit: July 2019,Begum's,4,"Muscat, Oman"
Excellent. Great. Would stay there again.,"This place was just perfect for our family of 4. The suite had more than enough room for all of us to be comfortable. Enough sleeping spots for even more than 4 in our suite. Kitchen was spotless and very nicely stocked. The bathroom was so clean and large. Bath tub too. Amazing views! Patio so large and lovely to enjoy. Really nice breakfast selection. The owner was so kind (but sometimes hard to track down).

There was a hiking trail head just minutes walk from the accommodations. Also just a short walk to the center of town and all the activity. Even a little restaurant a stones throw away. Oh, and a park for kids to enjoy right there too. Lovely place.",Date of stay: June 2019,Alsos House,4,"Kalambaka, Greece"
Clean! Convenient shop below apartments. Sweet & kind Owners,"The first thing that I’d like to say about this place is that it is owned by the sweetest family, they were over-the-top generous with us. The owners speak very little English but they went the extra mile to make you feel welcome and comfortable. Always greeting you with smiles and even hugs when we left.

We were a family of 4 staying for quite a few days so we had 2 bedrooms joined in the middle with a kitchenette and small bathroom. We found it quite comfortable for our stay. The bathroom was a tad squishy but it worked. The kitchen had a little bar fridge and you could cook on a small stove. A nice kitchen table to sit two people and storage space there as well. The best part of it was that it was sparkling clean for us. So important.

The patio area outside the studio was our favourite place to play cards, enjoy breakfast and look at the view.

So convenient to have a little store to buy snacks and beverages just below the accommodations.

Only struggle was the amount of stairs to walk down to the centre of town and to the beach and then back up to the apartment. We got our exercise in everyday.

Really a lovely place to stay.",Date of stay: June 2019,Lorenzo Studios,4,"Paros, Greece"
Sweet!,"This place was absolutely a delightful treat. We were overwhelmed by the generosity of the lovely owner. We tried many, many of the desserts and all of them won us over. Our favourite was the warm doughnut balls covered in chocolate drizzle and a large scoop of ice cream. Oh, wow, it was delightful. We were able to purchase some good quality olive oil as well as some cookies and sweets to take home to share too. Very nice place.",Date of visit: June 2019,Tripolitsiotis Paradosiaka,4,"Paros, Greece"
Good portions of great food,"We had great food, good sized portions at reasonable prices. The service was excellent - staff so friendly and efficient and the servers really connected with the kids making sure they were happy with their meals. We would definitely return for another meal.",Date of visit: June 2019,Pizzarella,4,"Paros, Greece"
"Great food, bad service","The food is ok. I’ve had better, I’ve had worse. This would be a whole lot better if the staff dealing with the customers were pleasant, friendly, and helpful. It’s stressful trying to order and they don’t help you out at all. But, the menu had a lot of variety and the seating outside is quite nice.",Date of visit: June 2019,Ragoussis Bakery Bistro,4,"Paros, Greece"
Unique guesthouse.,"This is a really interesting little guesthouse. The decor took me completely by surprise when entering the building but in a good way. It was a welcoming little place to stay but you are sure to be awake at 7:30am with the ringing of church bells. The rooms were clean and sufficient yet very cozy. The breakfast table is the most interesting part of the experience as you can let them know when you’ll be ready for your spread and they’ll prepare the table for you for the time you state which means you may be seated with the other hotel guests for your morning coffee. We had a very good group of other guests to share our breakfast time with so it was a pleasant experience if you’re up for a chat with others in the morning. My only disappointment was with the lack of selection served for breakfast. Only bread, cheese, small selection of deli meat and spreads. No veggies, fruit, yogurt or cereal.",Date of stay: May 2019,Kallisto Traditional Guesthouse,4,"Litochoro, Greece"
Amazing little Boutique Hotel,"Nice location, clean rooms and friendly staff. Easy check-in and kid friendly. Buffet breakfast was well done with a lot of selection: olives, bread, yogurt, deli meat, cereal, sweets, tea/coffee, veggies, eggs, bacon and fruit. Location of hotel is perfect. View from dining area is just stunning.",Date of stay: May 2019,Kastalia Boutique Hotel,4,"Delphi, Greece"
Yum! These Gyro’s are awesome.,"We loved the food here so much that we intend on returning again for dinner. It was absolutely delicious. We tried the chicken gyro, pork portion, pork gyro and sausage gyro. All of them excellent. The favourite was the sausage though. It was so busy in there with bus loads of tourists specifically seeking out this restaurant to eat because it’s so good.",Date of visit: May 2019,Dionysios Souvlaki Gyro Shop,4,"Delphi, Greece"
