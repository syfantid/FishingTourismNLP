THE best day of our holiday!,"Its an early start, but so worth it. With only 12 passengers it was a very intimate and interesting trip. Giorgio was so friendly and makes everyone feel very welcome as soon as you get on board. You can have as much ‘hands on’ experience as you wish, helping to put nets in and out, taking fish out of the nets etc. Then relax in the sea for a swim before lunch is served. Fresh pasta, fish, salad and wine. Beautiful! All in all a truly unique fishing experience!
THANK YOU! Giorgio and team for a very memorable day",Date of experience: May 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Siesta Key Rum Tour,"Interesting, factual tour with rum tasting before and after! Perfect afternoon. Family run business with information on how rum is made and hand bottled and labelled. Well worth a visit.",Date of experience: July 2016,Siesta Key Rum,5,"Sarasota, Florida"
