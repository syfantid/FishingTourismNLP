Perfect Fishing Trip,"Vassilis and Antonis were absolutely great and gave us an amazing experience. We did not have any experience fishing but still managed to catch a couple small ones due to the very friendly crash course and expertise of the crew! Plenty of time for fishing, and we even made a second stop.
To top it up some snorkeling while Vassilis expertly prepares the days catch and some fresh salad and a nice trip back to the harbor!",Date of experience: September 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
