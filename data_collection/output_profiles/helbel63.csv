Delicious authentic food,"Fabulous food. Opposite Woodstock police station. Don't be put off by surroundings. Food is sublime, generous and reasonable. I have never been to Morocco but I felt like I was in Morocco once inside. If you looking for flashy first world looking area then don't go there.",Date of visit: October 2019,Andalousse Moroccan Cuisine,4,"Woodstock, South Africa"
Fantastic views and delicious food.,"If you drove past because the sign didn't grab you, turn back. We stopped for a drink and returned the next day for lunch. It was so delicious, generous portions and the decor is chic and trendy. Perfect spot. Unfortunately we were at the end of our holiday so ran out of time otherwise would have returned again and again. Very reasonable too. Need bunting flags on road at the sign to attract more attention to this superb spot.",Date of visit: July 2019,Hellenic Bistro,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Excellent value for money, basic and clean, why would you need more","Angelo and Anna welcome guests like family. The situation is perfect with the sounds of lapping waves putting you to sleep at night if you sleep with doors open. We stayed in Room 17 which had 2 bedrooms, 1 with aircon and double bed - room faces mountain and other faces the bay, 2 single beds and fan, no aircon. The bathroom is a wet room with hand held shower, hook for shower to be overhead would be great. Linen is white cotton, clean and fresh. Kitchen area has wash up facility, 1 plate stove, kettle and fridge. Why cook when you have a choice of fabulous tavernas at the bottom of the steps. We were a little disappointed in Fotis but highly recommend Taverna Agrapidos food and view, Syeki Grill where nothing is too much trouble, Dionysos and think the last one was called Hello Bello which had delicious fare. All on seafront and charming. I would highly recommend it as it was very reasonable and well situated. Poros is laid back and not a high end resort but has a stunning beach to the far left with umbrellas and loungers. Supermarket 10 steps from hotel has drinks, yogurt, fresh fruit etc. Lovely gift shop and generally prices lower than Skala, Lourdata etc",Date of stay: July 2019,Poros House Hotel,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great setting and good food,"Christina our waitrons was superb. They were very busy and we hadn't booked as it was our first night here. Nothing too much trouble so we went for a stroll and returned to find the best table ready for us. Moussaka, Greek salad and calamari/squid - fresh and yummy.",Date of visit: July 2019,Steki Grill,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Good position, food disappointing",We popped in here twice for tapas but we're a bit disappointed both times. The gyro was dry but the Greek salad was good.,Date of visit: July 2019,Fotis Family,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Superb,"Superb meal with a magnificent view. Perfect for our last night in Poros 8.7.19. Mussels Saganaki, Stuffed Tomatoes, Fried and Grilled Squid. Custard Pie to round off. Portions are substantial and easily shared. We took our own MCC with no issues. Charming waitrons and hosts.",Date of visit: July 2019,Taverna Agrapidos,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Day Trip on working fishing boat,"A lovely day trip on a working fishing boat with this hardworking family. On arrival we had cake and Greek coffee. Lunch was salads, lobster, soup, spaghetti and bruschetta for appetisers. Water, wine and juice included. Stopped off in a little beach alcove for lunch after collecting the nets with our catch for lunch. Whilst food is prepped you are free to swim from the boat and to shore. Generous portions and delicious. Dessert was watermelon and lemon cake although I think they usually only serve fruit. Everything is freshly caught and grown in their garden. Wine and olive oil is also made by them. We drove from Poros, 50 min drive then another 25 mins to port which is not well sign posted from the main road. We did a recce the day before as it is an early start 8am. Boat takes 12 so no crowds or loud party music. Antonia is w
knowledgeable and quite a character. Photos below of our lunch and location. Note they collect and drop fishing nets which takes some time but part of the experience. We returned to Port at 430.",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
