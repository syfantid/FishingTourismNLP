An excursion of a lifetime,This was a highlight of our visit to Santorini. Anthi is so very proud of what she does and her heritage. It bleeds through in all she does on the fishing trip. Her crew is very helpful and cheery as well. We truly enjoyed every minute. It was very informative to learn about several aspects of fishing from traps to nets to hand lines. We strongly recommend this fishing experience.,,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,1,"Santorini, Greece"
Wonderful stay,"The hotel grounds are immaculate. The staff are wonderful and attentive. This is an older complex but is well worth the money spent. There is a short, enjoyable 10 minute walk to town on a nice lighted pathway. The stay here was perfect.",Date of stay: June 2019,Hotel Eri,1,"Paros, Greece"
A Hidden Gem,Pass every other eatery and head straight here. The food is very fresh and delicious. They really take their time in preparation of food ordered. We will be back again!!,Date of visit: June 2019,Argo Restaurant,1,"Antiparos, Greece"
A must visit,We have eaten here twice so far and have relished every morsel. Everything is so very fresh and the staff is lovely. I have had pork pitas twice. My wife swears by the summer salad.,Date of visit: June 2019,Hellas,1,"Paros, Greece"
Do not waste your time,We were greeted promptly and were given drink menus as we had expressed that we had recently eaten in Parikia. We never were waited on after waiting for 15 minutes to see another couple and two bikini clad 20 somethings waited on ahead of us. The 20 somethings were waited on within 1 minute of arrival. We may have only been ordering beverages at this time but had plans on returning for dinner during our stay. Those plans are gone now. Treat all customers equally and you will have a better chance of retaining those customers for future visits.,Date of visit: June 2019,Markakis Restaurant,1,"Paros, Greece"
Poor service,You may want to skip this establishment if you are from the U.S. We were ignored by staff and were never served. We finally walked off after watching staff attend to others that had arrived after us.,Date of visit: June 2019,Sunset Ammoudi,1,"Santorini, Greece"
