Perfect place to visit with kids,"Downstairs you saw videos shot by tourists and upstairs news clips. Videos were short enough to keep you interested. Modern kids love videos, so this is a great place to get some information of Iceland.",Date of experience: October 2018,Tales from Iceland,4,"Reykjavik, Iceland"
Very basic,"Rooms were very basic. Radiator was on full blast and window was lest open. Window wasn't tight, so you got draft and noise from street all night long.
Shower was really miserable with the stinking water and adhesive curtain. It made the floor wet and you didnt have anything to dry it with. We both got allergic symptoms form the room. So I dont recommend at all.",Date of stay: October 2018,Metropolitan Hotel,4,"Reykjavik, Iceland"
