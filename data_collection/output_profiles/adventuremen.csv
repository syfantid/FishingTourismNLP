Truly amazing fishing trip! Must do in kos city!,"a friend of mine and I were looking for a fun fishing trip, and that's exactly what we found. when we arrived at the boat we asked for some information about the trip, which we immediately received with open arms. they were very clear about the possibility of catching fish that day and were very honest about it. Mrs. Timmy immediately indicated that the chance was small that we would catch something because of the strong wind and the big waves, we thought that was a shame but still wanted to join them on the fishing trip. the trip was about 4 hours and costs 40 euros per person. this is well worth it also because after the fishing you were able to eat the caught fish yourself at a restaurant that prepares the caught fish (voluntarily) for you for free, it is nice to order something on top of it, so they can earn something on it as they are not making any money on the brought fish. On board was Timmy (She likes to call herself the captain but is actually the fun maker on board) and alexis (the real captain who is actually present for the balance of the boat (that's how he liked to call himself). both very nice and happy to tell us how to catch the fish in the best possible way etc. despite the fact that they indicated before the trip that it would not be very successful we still caught 20 fish which we have eaten in the restaurant. it has been super successful and we had a great time. We even went with them for a second time. definitely recommended for all sport anglers to join the trip!
