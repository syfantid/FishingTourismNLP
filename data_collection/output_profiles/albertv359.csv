"Soothing, Tranquil, An Amazing Experience","This is a must do. Anytime visiting Santorini from here on out this will be on my Itinerary. Most relaxing time I had. From the fresh catch straight to the grill was oh so real. Fresh sea food does not come fresher than that. Enjoyed meeting the folks on the boat. The swim was nice and at the end get to watch the OÃ­a sunset. All in all I highly recommend this fishing experience. The host were great, kind, friendly",,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
