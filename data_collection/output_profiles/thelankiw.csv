Lovely diving session,It was my 1st time diving and Kostas helped me to calm down and explained things well. Enjoyable experience and look forward to having another dive when I next visit,Date of experience: August 2020,Marathon Divers Club,1,"Marathon, Greece"
Amazing day out fishing,"Best day of the trip, helped with the fishing nets and swam at a secluded beach while our lunch was being prepared. We got to see a few turtles as well, circling our boat while we were eating! Had a lovely lobster spaghetti as well as other fresh Greek dishes. Very friendly and excellent service, and really good communication. Really appreciated the quick responses whenever we had any questions beforehand, and thanking us by text soon after the trip and sending us photos, really added a personal touch. Would highly recommend to anyone who loves fishing, seafood and the sea!",Date of experience: July 2020,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
very rude staff,"Private room booking for bday party. Okay experience except the waitress allocated to our room was incredibly rude, replying back and making sarcastic comments. Having read similar comments i am not surprised at the feedback, and feel this should really be addressed as people go out to dine not just for the food but the overall experince-which includes friendly staff who put customers first and enhance the evening.
In addition The orders of the food were shouted out to us whilst we were in mid conversation, as if we were at a market. Felt very unprofessional and rude, which a few of my guests felt uncomfortable with. Would not recommend i'm sad to say. Also no phone signal at all in the room, which made it difficult for latecommers to find the room",Date of visit: February 2020,Tuttons,1,"London, United Kingdom"
