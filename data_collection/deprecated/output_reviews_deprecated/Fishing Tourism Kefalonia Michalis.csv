0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelA955,October 2020,5,A great insight into the fishing life of Kefalonia combined with amazing food and great swimming and relaxation too!,"Thank you for Michalis and Antonia for looking after us all so beautifully yesterday. As a family of six adults we were greeted on the dock with home made cake and coffee before we set off and then experienced in a very small way the life of the fishing boat. 2km of nets pulled in, hard work, brutal at times, explained in Antonia’s excellent English.   The fabulous appetiser and lunch interspersed time swimming in the azure seas and diving off the boat. By the time we set off back for the port we were all happily full, relaxed and tired.   What a lovely day out! …"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emybee393,September 2020,5,Unforgettable Experience,"Wow! What an incredible experience this was! Antonia and Michalis are wonderful, friendly people and they truly make you feel like family. Everything in the description is accurate and it’s worth your time and money! From helping with the catch, enjoying the ride on open water, eating a fabulous meal, swimming in a secluded area, to laughing and chatting, it’s truly magical. I hope to visit Kefalonia again so I can book this trip! Don’t hesitate! Book now!…"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R7767OTkarinr,August 2020,5,Great relaxing day out,Amazing day out with Antonia and Michalis. First great fishing adventure; getting to see the nets being brought up and the catch of the day. Very fascinating for kids. Afterwards you stop by in a small secluded bay where you can swim and jump off the boat while Antonia prepares the most amazing fish-based lunch.  We found it really interesting to have time to speak to Antonia too and ask her about local customs and other things we'd been wondering about Greece and the islands.   A great day out that I can warmly recommend!…
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malt73,August 2020,5,Fantastic day out with the best food!,"Absolutely fabulous day out with Michalis Fishing. Antonia greeted us with Greek coffee and the most fabulous cake which her daughter had made. Once the other two families had joined us we set sail for where Captain Michalis had set the nets the previous day. We watched as the nets were reeled in and the catch was removed from the nets, and then we stopped in a lovely bay for a swim. Whilst we relaxed in the water Antonia made the most delicious bruschetta with all fresh ingredients - so tasty.  Then we set sail for an alternative spot for another swim stop whilst lunch was prepared. I can’t describe how fantastic the food was. A good fish restaurant in London would have charged a small fortune for half of what we ate. Absolutely beautiful. The wine and water flowed all day too. After lunch and another few swims and relaxing on the boat in the sun we set off back to the marina.  It was the perfect day. The hosts were so friendly and it was really interesting watching the nets being brought up and emptied. And then the catch being turned into our lunch! But even if you don’t have the remotest interest in fishing you will still have a great day out on the water with lovely people. We would thoroughly recommend it. If you’re concerned about Covid-19 this year I can assure you they very much look after you - The boat is bigger than I expected but they don’t take out too many people so social distancing is not a problem. With temperature checks etc on arrival they clearly take every precaution to make sure everything is safe for their guests.  We absolutely loved it and will definitely book when we’re next in Kefalonia. Thank you to everyone on board for making our day so special.  Kat and Jonathan. X…"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Great_Expectations75,August 2020,5,This trip is a must if you like (love?) great food,"Let me just say this: before this trip, I had never NOT finished a lobster. With Michalis, we had so much of it (wonderfully cooked, just absolutely stunningly delicious!) that we just couldn't eat it any more! Antonia is a wonderful cook and a brilliant host.   We didn't catch much fish, but what we did catch was: a stingray (threw it back overboard), crabs (ditto), a shark (ditto), octopus (cooked and ate), a scary looking fish (overboard), and a few plain looking fish (also overboard as there were just too few of them to cook). Kids had a great time, we all ate loads, jumped and dived off the boat into crystal clear water of the lagoon Antonia's husband took us to while we were waiting for our lunch to be cooked. This trip is a must, really, and we'll definitely be doing it again when we're back in Kefalonia.…"
