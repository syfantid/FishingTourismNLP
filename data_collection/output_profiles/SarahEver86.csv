A week in Greek heaven!,"We had such a wonderful week staying at Peristera. The apartments are spotlessly clean and were kept like that for the entire week. The pool is absolutely lovely and the setting is stunning. The gardens are kept beautifully and it really makes for a relaxing break away from it all. The breakfast was tasty although we only had it a couple of days as we were usually out and about before it was served (9-11). He location is a convenient 10-15 minute walk from town, and Katelios itself is beautiful. Couldn’t recommend it enough, many thanks to our kind and generous hosts.",Date of stay: July 2018,Peristera Apartments,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely drinks and seevice,"We made sure we stopped here every night on our way into two for a drink or two before dinner, and occasionally afterwards too! It’s a lovely setting with excellent service and a nice place to unwind after a day in the sun. Yes the cocktails are a little more expensive than elsewhere but are by far the best. The wine and lager are about he same price as elsewhere and well worth the visit. Highly recommended.",Date of experience: June 2018,Alexis Cocktail Bar,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
A great place for lunch and drinks,We made sure we came to Nemesis every day for lunch or drinks. The service was excellent and food was great. The beach loungers we’re comfortable and usually available. Reasonably priced and well worth a visit.,Date of visit: June 2018,Nemesis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great service and great food!,We visited here a couple of times on our trip and were never disappointed. The food was delicious and the service was fantastic. The chicken souvlaki pita was to die for!,Date of visit: June 2018,Katelios Taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
A FANTASTIC TRIP!,"This trip was absolutely incredible. The hosts were so friendly and kind, we had such a fun day and enjoyed every moment. Efi’s cooking is so so tasty, and her homemade wine is even better! We caught and ate an wonderful amount of fish, the swimming in the sea was just paradise and the whole day was honestly one of best I’ve ever had on a holiday. Well worth every penny and can’t recommend the trip enough!",Date of experience: June 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Excellent stay in a lovely cabin,"Had a wonderful stay earlier in the year in one of the cabins. They are very well looked after and have everything you need for a nice break away. As a group of 6 adults we had more than enough room and didnt get under each others feet. The amenities are excellent, the location is stunning and the hot tub is great fun!! Would highly recommend. Excellent value.",Date of stay: January 2018,Herston Caravan & Camp Site,1,"Swanage, United Kingdom"
I’m sure it’s lovely... if you actually get to stay!,"I’m sure the hotel is lovely if you actually get to stay in it, it looks great in the pictures and would have been a great first holiday for myself and my partner and a lovely birthday trip away. Unfortunately after booking our trip circa 6 months in advance our booking was cancelled as they had ‘overbooked’. Presumably they bumped us for someone willing to pay more despite the fact that we’d booked so far in advance. From what I can understand from various reviews over various sites this isn’t uncommon for this hotel. Unable to cancel our flights we are committed to a holiday we don’t really want at an overpriced hotel we don’t want to stay in. Simply unacceptable.",Date of stay: May 2018,Thalassa Boutique Hotel,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Incredible holiday!,"Just got back from Manas Park after one of the best holidays ever. I have never written a review on here before but really wanted to tell everybody what an incredible hotel this is. I just don’t understand how anybody can fault it!!! Every single one of the staff were absolutely fantastic, always serving us with a smile and a chat. The chaps behind the bar and in the restaurant work so hard but were always so friendly and attentive. The food was absolutely delicious, you’ll never go hungry. The breakfasts were lovely, with fresh omelettes made in front of you and all kinds of different options. The lunch and dinner buffets were fantastic, so many different options – although the rotisserie chicken and lovely salads were usually my choice! And there’s always the snack bar if you fancy a burger or pizza and fries. The rooms were lovely, cleaned thoroughly every day and very modern. There was always room by the pool with plenty of clean towels. I have to say I wasn’t expecting the 24 hour bar to be on the all-inclusive, which was a lovely surprise, and the beer/wine/cocktails were all very, very drinkable!!! What really makes this hotel though is the staff, Bloody Erol and Garfield make you feel so very welcome from the start of the holiday, making everybody feel relaxed and at home. This creates such a wonderful atmosphere with the guests, I’ve never chatted to so many people on holiday and made so many new friends. The entertainment in the evening is also great fun, Bloody Erol had me in stitches every night!! Seriously cannot rave about this hotel enough, I will absolutely be coming back. A wonderfully relaxing hotel with coastal views to die for and great friendly staff who will do anything to help you. Thank you so much to Erol, Garfield and all the staff for making our holiday so fantastic!!

Worth a visit just for the hot tub alone!!!!,"Had a fantastic three night get away at this adorable b&b in the stunning town of Bath. We stayed in Room No.1 which had a fabulous four poster bed and beautiful decor. It was impeccably clean and a great size with a good view.

Breakfast was lovely with a great selection of food. The b&b is a good 25 minute walk from town, but it is all downhill and a beautiful walk, passing the Royal Crescent. Naturally we got a taxi back, which was easy and cheap(about £5). Its worth the distance away, just for the hot tub!! Had a wonderful two hours in an idyllic setting, perfect for the cold nights in winter.

The owners were very friendly and approachable, giving us very helpful advice regarding restaurants, how to get into town, getting to places etc.
One of the other great things about this b&b was the incredibly cheap mini-bar, which we made great use of after a hard day in the city!!!
