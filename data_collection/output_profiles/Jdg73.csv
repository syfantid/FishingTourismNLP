Cotswold idyll,"Good food, pleasant room even on the hottest nights. Young and friendly staff. We spent two relaxed and enjoyable days. Visited Kelmscott Manor (3 miles away). The local church is the resting place of the fashion designer Sir Hardy Amis.
Not only is this place dog friendly but is also horse accommodating with its own mounting block of local stone.",Date of visit: July 2018,The Bell Inn,4,"Langford, United Kingdom"
Favourite eatery,"This was our most visited eatery. The service was great, it has a homely family feel and the food is cooked to order. The single dish, oven cooked, meals are a delight. I can recommend the rabbit and my wife loved the shrimps. Sitting under the tree on our last day was a good memory.",Date of visit: May 2017,Maria's Taverna,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Spring break,"Would recommend this hotel for a tranquil break. Good pool spotless rooms, breakfast only but it is on the outskirts of the small fishing village with good restaurants, few shops no discos. Good walking country, spring flowers, wild life and adventures - see 'fishing cruise's Kefalonia.",Date of stay: May 2017,Villa Dei Sogni,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Catching lunch,"Highly recommended - a great day out, Dimitrios and Efthimia run a very tight ship with skill and good humour. On this trip you experience the real life of a fisherman, visit beautiful places to swim, weather permitting, see lots of strange creatures from the deep and get to eat some of them beautify cooked by Efthimia.
On our trip besides ourselves 74 and 68 there were another young couple with a boy of three and a baby of four months, all coped with, without fuss.",Date of experience: May 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Post Dickensian treat,"I knew this Dikensian pub in the 1980's and its conversion into a boutique hotel is very well done. We turned up early for check in and the reception could not have been nicer finding a table for us in the buzzy restaurant for a very good meal. We walked to the Barbican to see a production. Next day, after a good nights sleep, we took a Dickensian walk to Doughty Street for the Dickens Museum and took a peek at the Old Curiosity Shop on our way back to the station. All in all a great place to stay.",Date of visit: January 2017,The One Tun,4,"London, United Kingdom"
