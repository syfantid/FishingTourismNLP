Hot Tub break,"We stayed in early August for a weeks break using the hot tub as much as we could in the rain! This was a spacious and well kept lodge with all the facilities we needed, our boys had a room each and it was a great base to tour Oban from.

The Spar shop is just round the corner and the wee games room with a pool table and table tennis table is just enough to fill a bit of time at night. The staff are incredibly helpful and we thoroughly enjoyed our time here.",Date of stay: August 2019,Loch Awe Holiday Park,4,"Taynuilt, United Kingdom"
Serious lunch,"A fantastic setting looking out over the water makes a great start for this seafood extravaganza!

With plenty of choice across the board from shellfish to fresh grilled fish this is certainly a place where serious seafood eaters can enjoy a meal. The restaurant has its own boat and lands fresh seafood on the harbour every day so you can be assured of the best.

We had fantastic starters with scallops and langoustines followed by seafood stews, fish pie and a beautifully grilled sole with lemon butter.

This is a great place to eat with the only downside being the cost, bring your card!",Date of visit: August 2019,Cafe Fish,4,"Isle of Mull, United Kingdom"
Sometimes you win...,"With time wearing on and not having booked anywhere we chanced a gamble on Bar Rio as Oban was busy and we figured you can't go much wrong with Pizza and Pasta.

Unfortunately this was the wrong assumption and what was delivered to us was no better than a shop bought soggy disappointment. Loaded with too much cheese and overwhelmed with garlic the pizza was not what I had expected. The carbonara was heavy with thick cream sauce and was too stodgy to really enjoy.

Looking round the steak looked a much better option but by this time there was no saving Rio....

No win this time on a restaurant gamble.",Date of visit: August 2019,Rio,4,"Oban, United Kingdom"
Worth a visit,"Hidden out of the way close to Taynuilt is the beautiful setting of the Brander Lodge. Staying at the local holiday park we walked here to find ourselves in a lovely breakfast room overlooking the garden. It was a shame that it was raining as a seat outside would have been lovely!

We sat down to an excellent lunch with well presented food, lovely soup and sandwich combinations and plenty of choice across the menu. While it wasn't cheap, it was excellent and the staff could not have been nicer or more helpful in suggesting a trip down to the waterside.

I'd venture back here again.",Date of visit: August 2019,The Brander Lodge Hotel & Bistro,4,"Taynuilt, United Kingdom"
How it should be,"Please just forget about the restaurants and everywhere else selling seafood in Oban and head here. If you're lucky you might get a seat under the canopy if not just slum it on the edge off the harbour!

Whatever you eat from the massive Crab sandwich, to oysters or the giant seafood plate you will not be disappointed. The queue of foreign visitors tells a tale that this is the freshest of food from our beautiful shores.

Half a dozen oysters at less than a pound each and a plate of mussels meant that was in heaven, I don't think I'd want to eat seafood anywhere else in this town.",Date of visit: August 2019,Oban Seafood Hut,4,"Oban, United Kingdom"
Fantastic stay,"We stayed at this resort for two weeks and were very impressed with the service and cleanliness of the hotel. It's recently been refurbished and to a very high standard which is maintained by the constant vigilance of the staff. Nothing was too much trouble for them and really we didn't have to do a thing for ourselves.

The staff at the spa were excellent and my time in the Hammam was amazing! Very much enjoyed being treated like a king. The gym is reasonable and a good size, never tried the indoor heated pool for obvious reasons!

The buffet meals were varied and the food was always fresh for breakfast, lunch and evening meals. We tried the a la carte restraints but found the tasting menu a bit much to eat over the course of the evenings. The only thing that bothered me was you were not allowed to fill a water bottle at the bar area during the days, a bit strange.

There were plenty sunbeds for everyone and the beach area is very well kept. Evening entertainment got a bit repetitive but you could easily retire to the bars.

Local taxi rank is just across the road and there are a few excellent restraints and bars close by if you do want a change. I would avoid paying for ant Tui tours, it's easy to organise your own from the harbour for a much better price.",Date of stay: July 2019,Akti Imperial Deluxe Resort & Spa Dolce by Wyndham,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Relaxed lunch,"We spent a good few hours at Pedi beach being served by the staff here, it's well run and very well maintained. The sea deck where lunch is served is stunning and we were all very welcomed by the staff. We stuck with Calamari and shrimps and were not disappointed with the quality of the food. Loads of tasty bread and the best Garlic dip went down well with us, a bit more expensive than usual but worth it for the scenery.

We would all go back again!",Date of visit: July 2019,Restaurant & Beach Bar Katsaras,4,"Symi, Greece"
Exercise before lunch,"If you fancy some exercise before lunch then have a go at the 357 steps up to the village, there are plenty of great photo stops on the way and some great views at the top. It's less of a tourist place at the top where you can get lovely pastries at the local bakery or even climb the rest of the way to the church at the top. It doesn't take a long time but might be tougher in the mid day heat.

Give the Olive Tree Cafe a shot if you're looking for some tea and cake!",Date of experience: July 2019,Kali Strata,4,"Symi, Greece"
Absolutely idyllic,"We ended up here after climbing the Kali Strata steps and I have to say it was a very peaceful and beautiful location. Sunbeds are €5 each and run by the local hotel. The water is clear and still and there are a few fish to be seen if you bring your snorkels, the hotel brings drinks to the sunbeds and even brought some complimentary snacks out!

We spent a good ,3 hours here before catching the local bus back to the harbour, a cracking day out.",Date of experience: July 2019,Pedi Beach,4,"Symi, Greece"
Welcome break,"At the top of the Kali Strata lies a beautiful hidden gem of a cafe, ful of atmosphere, great food and very pleasant staff. The ladies that run this place could not be nicer and serve up some tasty dishes including excellent home made cake! The lemonade was sharp as refreshing and the view over symi was really great.

Thanks to the owners recommedation we took the ten minute walk t Pedi beach from there, well worth it. If you can make the climb don't miss The Oive Tree out of your trip.",Date of visit: July 2019,The Olive Tree Cafe,4,"Symi, Greece"
Can't move yet,"Holy Moly what an absolute feast we had at this outstanding Asian restaurant. Sushi, Sashimi or Miso are all catered for extremely well in this well appointed out of the way hotspot. We opted for some sushi and gyoza which came with a lovely sweet/sour dip and followed this up with a massive Korean barbecue complete with kimchi and lettuce wraps which took us over 2 hours to eat!

The only downside to this restaurant is the time it will take you to try and make up your mind what you want to eat!

Honestly if you're in Rhodes don't miss it, the place could make a fortune in the UK.",Date of visit: July 2019,Nami Sushi & Korean BBQ,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Good day out,"Definitely the best value for money park I have been in, there are a variety of ways to go with the local bus and free bus being the cheapest option. Depending on where you are located taxis all have set fares. Adult day tickets are €24 and can be bought online or on the day. The park is well organised and most rides are in easy walking distance of each other, for those too tired by the heat there is a little land train to ferry you around. Food was very well priced with most main courses around €8 with drinks at €2.

Wear water shoes as the ground is hot and they cost €10 to buy them at the park, rash vests and t-shirts are also allowed on all the rides. Huge variety of rides as well to suit all levels of thrill seeker. Lockers are available and you can also load up your wristband with cash to spend getting any back at the end of the day.

My only gripe is that not all the staff are as well trained and I found some to be quite abrupt and at times rude to customers, a bit disappointing.",Date of experience: July 2019,Water Park,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Relaxed lunch,Up a side street and out of the bustle is a lovely place called Zizi. With some pergolas and beautiful flowers all around it was a great place to stop. The food is fairly standard across Taverna's and opting for fried squid and mussels we were not disappointed. There is a family feel to this place and I enjoyed lunch here a lot.,Date of visit: July 2019,Zizi Restaurant,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
History buff,"If you like to look at ancient ruins and the civilizations of the past then this place in Rhodes is for you. To start with kids are free and it cost us €16 for two adults which is always a bonus, no gift shops either which avoids filling your house with junk! You have to go through every door to realise how big the place is and it's full of artifacts from all the ages. Favourites for me were the murals and the outdoor gardens, well worth a visit.",Date of experience: July 2019,Archaeological Museum of Rhodes (Hospital of the Knights),4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Grand Day Out,"We spent a fantastic day out on this trip paying €190 for the four of us. We were picked up from our hotel, which for a small company was a really nice touch. The boat sets off from Collona harbour and takes about 30 mins to reach the fishing area. Captain Mixhaillis was great at showing us how to bait and fish and was very patient with us when things were not going well! We fished for around two hours catching a variety of small fish and some larger puffer fish unwelcome visitors from the red Sea. We then took a trip closer to shore where we swam and waited while the captain prepared a fantastic fish barbecue and salad for us. This was a cracking day out and we couldn't have been better looked after!",Date of experience: July 2019,Captain Manolis Fishing Trips in Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Brilliant food,"A great meal tonight at a friendly local restaraunt. With two teenagers and a gluten free pensioner to feed in our midst there was still a fantastic range of food to suit all our tastes and a reasonable spread of prices across the board.

Excellent starter of chilli and garlic prawns with a really tasty side salad of sweet and sharp leaves with beetroot. Crunchy soda bread to dip and I was hooked. A pizza sized garlic bread light enough for a main course to follow on with.

My main of braised beef with mash, celeriac and pancetta was rich, thick and again really tasty, the two portions of sea bass were well balanced and the teenage staple of pizza went down really well.

The best thing about the whole meal was flavour, very dish had something going on and it was a delight to be eating for fun and flavour rather than just filling up! Great job Jam Jar!",Date of visit: February 2019,Jam Jar,4,"Bridge of Allan, United Kingdom"
A different day out,"With nothing on at the imax worth watching and a big fat no to any museums we voted for an hour of.....well we were not quite sure what.

Easy to find after a wee saunter from George square we had a wait upstairs in merchant square where we could have had our choice of foods then downstairs we went into Escape reality.

The very helpful Fran talked us through the process making sure we knew we were never really locked in but also keeping us mindful it was a race against the clock.

What followed ended up being 50 minutes of laughing, arguing, cheering and being frustrated as a family as we tried to solve a variety of puzzles to escape each room. It was a great chance for us all to talk and work together and way better than sitting in a cinema watching a screen. It was reminiscent for me of the adventure game or the crystal maze and I would happily go back and try some of the other games they have on offer. Perhaps a bit steep in price ( hence the 4 stars) for what it actually is but definitely something different. Good family entertainment.",Date of experience: February 2019,Escape Reality,4,"Glasgow, United Kingdom"
Hidden gem.,"Tucked away amongst the egg and chips and cheap beer bars is this delightful little Mallorcan restaraunt offering tapas and good value for money paella. What makes this place stand out though is the genuine pleasure the owner seems to get from serving his customers. We had a great conversation about the history of the place and his passion for good food and wine. I have to say the wine choice was outstanding and it made my meal.

Get down and try some tapas at lunch then head back for Paella at night with a few glasses of red, you won't regret it.

Salut S'Amfora",Date of visit: October 2018,S'Amfora Restaurant,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Return trips,"We had two meals out in the impressive Ticoli Terrace with the most eye catching feature being the large open grill. I must say I was highly impressed with the lovely steak that I was served and my son's grilled rabbit was outstanding. We followed up this meal with a visit later in the week to sample the pizza from the oven and this was great value for money.

There was good service from the waiters and the chefs and I felt that I could have easily sat and been entertained all night by the live musician who was on. This was a great family destination and a very well run business.",Date of visit: October 2018,Tivoli Terrace,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Great tapas.,"We sat down a bit wet and fed up with what had been an overcast and dull day and a bit of a long trek from our hotel. There was a fairly large range of tapas too choose from and from looking around us the portions were better than I have received in a lot of tapas restaraunts.

As a family of four we ordered drinks an five tapas from the menu, one on the recommendation of the waiter. I was pleased when they brought the tapas out as they were ready and that we were encouraged to stretch out our meal as long as we wanted.

This place is in a street covered with other places offering a taste of Spain but it stands out from the rest for its character service and authentic style. I loved my meal and would easily recommend it to others.",Date of visit: October 2018,Ca'n Punyetes,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Music and Food,This is a traditional Cuban food restaurant that gives good value for money and a real mix of tourists and Cuban people. Don't expect the fancy plates and pristine presentation. What you do get is excellent ( and I do mean excellent!!!) service from waiters who want to help and food that is honest. I had a great tasting Ropa Vieja along with a generous mojito. The entertainment of music and salsa was all we needed for a great night out. We stayed for hours after eating and the staff. We're happy to make sure we got a safe taxi back to our hotel. A great night out.,Date of visit: September 2018,La Mina,4,Cuba
On a walk route,"Like most Spanish squares this one too bustles with life, architecture and many restaraunts. Depending on where the sun is and how much shade you can get you will decide where to eat, drink or just sit and listen to the many musicians and bands that stroll around. It's perfect for any time of the day but it really comes to life at night where Cuban music and Salsa are the order of the day.

There are a number of routes that include Plaza Vieja but all are worth it.",Date of experience: July 2018,Old Square (Plaza Vieja),4,Cuba
Great rest on a tiring day,"We stopped by here to get out of the searing heat of Havana and were treated to some excellent service by the knowledgeable staff. Instead of allowing us to buy expensive drinks the waiter suggested a jug of home made lemonade which was cheaper for the four of us. It arrived promptly and was absolutely delicious. Based on this honesty we stayed for an outstanding afternoon meal where we were treated to some well cooked seafood and far too many side dishes to eat.

A stunning setting along the Malecon and drinking some Havana Club and watching the sun go down was a fantastic experience. Thanks to all the staff for the wonderful treatment.",Date of visit: July 2018,Sociedad Asturiana Castropol,4,Cuba
"Clean, tidy and plenty room.","We attend here for a week and were very happy with the room and the beds that we had. For a family of four there was a double bed and a double sofa bed it enough for our two kids 12 and 14.

The hotel is in easy reach of Spittlemarket U-Bahn, literally 100m away and is within 10 minutes of Unter Der Linden. Not far away is a small area of restaurants where there are enough options for everyone on the way to Alexanderplatz station.

The breakfast is quite a price and if you don't want to pay this there is a supermarket around the corner where pastries, and morning rolls can be bought at a fraction of the price.

There is an adequate gym and a sauna downstairs, there is also a kids area in the hotel where you can play Xbox games or go online. The free wifi in the room was also more than good enough for all of us.

The hotel was clean tidy and very well appointed throughout, we really enjoyed our stay here.",Date of stay: October 2017,Novotel Berlin Mitte,4,"Berlin, Germany"
Great plate of food,One of the few places where we were made to feel very welcome as a family in Berlin. The choice was obviously very German but the food that we all received was outstanding. All four of us enjoyed the food and the generous litres of Paulaner.,Date of visit: October 2017,Maximilians Berlin,4,"Berlin, Germany"
Best prices in Berlin,"This was an easy meal for the four of us and was the cheapest that we ate out over our weeks stay. Felt a bit sorry for the head waiter as he was rushing about like mad and was sure he'd get our order wrong but no!

Some great pizza and nicely cooked pasta, just a shame about the Carlsberg when you could have some great Berliner!",Date of visit: October 2017,Ristorante Piccolo Mondo,4,"Berlin, Germany"
"Great service, great food","What a fantastic find and a great place for homemade great tasting soups and stews. We thoroughly enjoyed the pumpkin soup and the chicken stew, just a shame some of the others weren't on that day. The owner was brilliant giving us extra bread and putting up with our very poor German. A place I would happily go back to again, if just for the comfortable seats and cushions. Berliners are missing out on this delight of a place.",Date of visit: October 2017,Karaca,4,"Berlin, Germany"
Dreadful service.,"This is such a shame as the terrible service really distracted us from really good food and great beer.

We were ignored for nearly ten minutes trying to get a table at night with no one even coming to say they were attempting to seat us. The uninterested and distracted waiter who served us eventually showed no sign of welcoming or helping us to choose from the menu and almost threw the food onto the table. He was visibly annoyed when we needed to order more drinks and clearly didn't even want to work.

The food was great with plenty of choice German dishes and the beer options while expensive were really good.

Shame really",Date of visit: October 2017,Brauhaus Georgbraeu,4,"Berlin, Germany"
Interesting for adults,"While the touristy checkpoint outside provides some good photo opportunities the museum itself was not really suited to our kids. There was far too much written and crammed into a massive space without any opportunity for interactive learning.

While I found it interesting having lived through the Cold War and the fall of the wall it didn't capture the kids. I'd give it a miss.",Date of experience: October 2017,Checkpoint Charlie,4,"Berlin, Germany"
History fiends only,"I really got a lot out of this place and was interested to read all about the transformation of the forerunner Gestapo site. The fact it is seated next to a remaining piece of the wall made it more interesting for me.

It didn't capture the kids imagination at all because like lots of the museums in Berlin there is little interaction with the exhibits and lots of reading.",Date of experience: October 2017,Topography of Terror,4,"Berlin, Germany"
Book and go,"If you like visiting tall buildings then this is the place for you. There are lots of options to do with dinner and drinks in the revolving restaurant but we just wanted to see the top.

A good tip is to plan your visit and book online or use the ticket machines where you can schedule your time to visit, that way you don't have to wait or hang around in Alexanderplatz.

The views from the top were great and you can actually get a picture of the complicated mixture of buildings in Berlin. The easy pictures on the viewing area actually gave us a couple more places to visit.

Top tip
Use the Berlin welcome card for a discount.",Date of experience: October 2017,Berliner Fernsehturm,4,"Berlin, Germany"
Outstanding,Literally the best choice of food in Berlin. Street food Thursday provides you with a massive variety of choices from around Germany and the world. Great atmosphere and a really friendly place. Take time out to pay it a visit even if it's not a Thursday.,Date of visit: October 2017,Markthalle Neun Berlin Kreuzberg,4,"Berlin, Germany"
Difficult but worthwhile,It's hard to try and rate a memorial as excellent because of what it is but this was a thought provoking and fascinating piece of history. It can quite chilling walking through the blocks and reflecting on why they there.,Date of experience: October 2017,The Holocaust Memorial - Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe,4,"Berlin, Germany"
Ancient History Tour,"We visited the amfiteatre first and bought a family ticket for all the ancient ruins in Tarragona. It was pretty cheap and allowed us access to all the sites. If you are into Greek and Roman ruins then these are for you, the kids were marginally interested but it's nice to see a city trying really hard to preserve and keep all of it's ancient monuments. It takes no longer than 20 mins to look around but you could sit for longer.",Date of experience: July 2017,Amfiteatre,4,"Tarragona, Spain"
Days journey,We visited here as part of the all day family ticket and spent about half an hour wandering around. There are some good views from the walls and enough to see to fill up a bit of time after lunch!,Date of experience: July 2017,Passeig Arqueològic,4,"Tarragona, Spain"
Port Aventuratastic,"We stayed in the Salauris Palace for two weeks in the height of tourist season. This is my review of the hotel and it's facilities.

Location. The hotel is placed in the ideal spot for visiting Port Aventura, it's a 10 minute walk to all three parks and is also only ten minutes from the Port Aventura rail stop. The town is a five minute walk and from there a choice of beaches can be accessed. There are plenty of shoos and supermarkets nearby but you may have to hunt for restaurants beyond the egg and chips!

Food. We opted for half board and were not disappointed. The choice and standard of food was excellent and there was not a night I was disappointed, particularly good seafood and plenty for the carnivores to love! There were times the restaurant was busy but usually 5 minutes was all we had to wait for a seat.

Facilities. The pool is one of the larger ones in Salou but was still very busy. The hotel ended up closing access to the pool before 9.00 am to avoid the towel brigade and this was a good touch. Thought the lifeguards on duty were excellent. The gym downstairs is a bit tired and not all the machines worked well could do with some work. The indoor pool, steam room, jacuzzi and sauna are very good but remember a cap for the indoor pool.

Entertainment. The entertainment team are the hardest working staff I have ever seen, on the go from early till late and if you've got small kids they'll be happy there all day. Some of the evening shows were really good. There were plenty pool tables (although at 2 euros a game it was a bit steep) and enough air hockey and an indoor gaming room to keep the kids happy.

Staff. Throughout my stay I was impressed with the staff and how helpful and pleasant they were, great at helping us plan our use of local transport and showing us where to go on our days out. Was also impressed with how well all the staff seem to work together across the hotel.

Rooms. We had a family room for four of us and it was more than big enough but a bit lacking in storage for clothes. The decor and furniture could do with some updating. Air conditioning was not the best and we found it really hot most nights.

I would recommend this hotel to others.",Date of stay: July 2017,H10 Salauris Palace,4,"Salou, Spain"
Super light show,This is a great end to a an evening meal at least as good as any fireworks show I've been to. Make sure you get down their at least 9.45 so that you can get a good spot to watch the show. The use of music and lasers in the show took me back to some nightclubs I visited in the eighties!,Date of experience: July 2017,Illuminated Fountain,4,"Salou, Spain"
Family fun,"There's enough to do in the park for the whole family with plenty of rides for all levels of thrill seeker. Best to arrive early so that you can find some sun beds in the shade and a base for the day. If you get a locker remember to keep the receipt as you need this to get your euros back at the end of the day. Queues were not too bad and the most we waited wax 15 minutes. Rash vests were allowed which was a bonus for our pale Scottish skin!

Food was pretty standard theme park but you could have lunch and a drink for about 10 euros each. You're allowed to take water in with you and no doubt could smuggle a sandwich in as well if you wanted!

I thoroughly enjoyed my day and would go back again.",Date of experience: July 2017,PortAventura Caribe Aquatic Park,4,"Salou, Spain"
Short visit,"Unless you are a serious Ferrari fan or a complete adrenaline junkie and desperate to add the Ferrari rides to your portfolio then this park is a waste of money. We went as part of the three parks in three days deal and were pretty much done in a couple of hours. There was genuinely not much to do beyond the two main rides and we were glad to get access to the port Aventura world for the rest of the day.

I wouldn't go back",Date of experience: July 2017,Ferrari Land,4,"Vila Seca, Spain"
A long day out,"We spent two days here and they couldn't have been more different. We went on a Monday and dealt with massive queues and really slow service from staff then again on a Friday and had short queues and a quick turn around!

Don't hold any stock with the ride times as advertised as these are never accurate, if you want to ride all the roller coasters then I would recommend a fast pass so that at least you can make them all in one day. You can stay from 10.00am till midnight but it's a long day.

Try to see some of the shows , the Wild West was pretty good and kept the kids happy.

Shambala everyone!",Date of experience: July 2017,PortAventura,4,"Salou, Spain"
Disappointing,"This could be a really nice park and it has a lot of potential but there is clearly a lack of funds available. There is a short garden and pond to look around and if you are into History then the past life of the park makes an interesting story but largely it's a poorly maintained piece of countryside.

If you have a car then try your luck but don't waste the taxi fare like we did, it's not worth it.",Date of experience: July 2017,Parc Samà,4,"Cambrils, Spain"
Great Tapas,"We were wandering round Tarragona and sat down here for lunch. The staff were excellent and service was very prompt, they speak little English but we got by on our mixed Spanglish! The food was fresh and excellent value for money, the shrimp and calamari were particularly good with ice cold beer.

I would absolutely recommend this cafe and would go back again.",Date of visit: July 2017,Tarakon,4,"Tarragona, Spain"
"Great Pizza, great views","We made a trip here from the far end of Port de Pollenca having heard the food was good. The choice of pizza and pasta was good and while we all chose pizza the plates of pasta coming from the kitchen looked impressive. If you eat in good Italian's you know that the smell is what delivers and the whole restaurant is filled with this. We chose some pizza from the menu and added a few toppings for a small charge, and were really impressed with the amount and the taste. Service from all the staff was great and I would recommend this as a family place.

Allows in with drinks came to about 60 euros.",Date of visit: April 2017,Little Italy Puerto Pollensa,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Quality food but.....,"We stopped here for lunch tempted by the impressive choice of tapas on offer for what seemed like a great price, 25 euros for five tapas which we were assured would serve two. Having gone with ten for four of us they came out as they were cooked and I found them to be good quality and tasty. Unfortunately there just wasn't enough of it for our liking and tbh I could've eaten five by myself.

The quality of food was good but I don't want to feel hungry after I've eaten.",Date of visit: April 2017,Can Punxo,4,"Majorca, Spain"
If you love fish....,This is a great restaurant if you are fish and seafood lovers. We found the quality of the food to be great and were happy with the price and simplicity of the food. Squid and Cuttlefish were great.,Date of visit: April 2017,Bodega Can Ferra,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Great Easter break,"We travelled as a family with two kids aged 11 and 14 on a package with Jet2. In a bid to age some money we gambled on half board for an extra £150 and were pleasantly surprised by the evening buffet. Fresh fish and veal most nights with Paella and some other Mallorcan dishes throughout the week. Surprised also by the fact they would cork up wine and save it for your next night if you didn't want the whole bottle. We had a junior suite big enough for four with a nice sea view, balcony was great but a bit spoiled by there guests smoking. The room had sent recently renovated as had the whole hotel and we were very happy with it . A real bonus was the new gym and spa free for guest use, just remember to say when you want to use it. I can see in high season how this hotel might struggle as the dining room is small for the size of it but at this time of year it was excellent. The fact the beach is directly over the road means this is a great family choice

There are a few restaurants to the right of the hotel offering to quality food at a price then the town is a good 10 minute walk away. The local Spar is a 2 minute walk offering fresh bread and plenty of food from easy lunches.",Date of stay: April 2017,Hoposa Uyal Hotel,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Pre Lunch workout!,Took the 345 bus from Port de Pollenca to Pollenca town for the day so we could wander the street and try the Calvari steps. To be honest it's not a tourist attraction it's a viewpoint and it's worth the climb. The steps are well maintained and there is room to rest at the sides if you are tired. Take some time at the top to look around the views of Pollenca and see if you can spit your hotel! There is a small cafe at the top if you need a drink and it's worth looking in the church and giving a small donation if you can.,Date of experience: April 2017,The 365 Calvari Steps,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Hearty lunch!,We stopped here after the Calvari steps and enjoyed a massive baguette and a beautiful plate of ham and cheese. The Scalinata special was devoured by my teenage son and the homemade burger was very tasty. Food takes a bit of time but it's a popular place and the kitchen work hard. Good value for money lunch!,Date of visit: April 2017,La Scalinata,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Out of the sun,This is a lovely quiet garden to get some shade and relax in. There are a lot of interesting photo opportunities with old architecture and a mix of light and shade.

A Grand day out,"I'm not sure who posts this as average or complains about the lack of stuff to do but clearly they belong in the theme parks of the world rather than the real world.

The fairy pools are a 45 minute walk from bottom to top if you stop and admire the natural beauty around you. The backdrop of the Black Cuillins makes it a fantastic place for a picnic and a few outstanding photos.

There's no doubt that some of the photos can make the pools seem larger and more outstanding, dependent on the amount of water in the river at the time but it's still a fantastic wee walk.

We were lucky enough to get a parking space on a clear but warm October day. We set off and explored as we went up stopping for a wee paddle and some lunch at the last of the pools near the top. All in all a decent hike that both the boys enjoyed.",Date of experience: October 2016,Fairy Pools,4,"Isle of Skye, United Kingdom"
Into the Shire,An absolutely beautiful spot to visit and wander round. The natural formations look like Hobbit homes rising out of the ground. If you enjoy a wee ramble then this is a lovely spot to walk and have a picnic,Date of experience: October 2016,Fairy Glen,4,"Isle of Skye, United Kingdom"
Not quite a 10 minute stroll!,"This is a pretty good hike up a hill that provides a clear and well marked route. I would have liked to combine this with a proper walk up the Storr and then over the rest of the hills but we were short on time.

If you just go up and back then there are clear views across Skye, look out for the Eagles overhead as you go. If you have walking poles then they are useful on the way down.",Date of experience: October 2016,The Old Man of Storr,4,"Isle of Skye, United Kingdom"
Plenty to eat here,A really interesting and varied menu meant there was something for everyone here. Totally impressed with the huge choice of teas available. Staff were very attentive and gave us great service. Kids had some really good looking toasted and I plumped for the massive chicken club which finished me off!,Date of visit: October 2016,Cafe Arriba,4,"Isle of Skye, United Kingdom"
What a surprise,"Totally blown away to find a restaurant that really just does one thing and does it to the highest standards.

This is an oven fired pizza restaurant that serves up the best pizza you are likely to find anywhere. The great service combined without the speed our food arrived at meant this was genuinely a delight.

The kids loved seeing the oven-cam showing their pizza cooking and for £48 for a meal and drinks this was excellent value for money. Definitely worth more than one visit.",Date of visit: October 2016,l'incontro Take away,4,"Isle of Skye, United Kingdom"
Surprisingly!,"On our way to Coral beach we stopped here for lunch because we couldn't find the Old Schoolhouse restaurant. I'm glad we didn't.

The prices were quite high for a tea room but you pay for the quality of the food. This was an excellent lunch and the hand made potato bread was amazing. Great tasting soup and bread and a huge slab of lemon drizzle cake to finish.

Service was excellent throughout and I would definitely come back again.",Date of visit: October 2016,Lochside Crafts,4,"Isle of Skye, United Kingdom"
Journey into Mordor,"We booked an online trip to loch Cuirisk and this was a really easy process. The journey to Elgol itself is fairly difficult and you need to take your time on the single track roads but the scenery is worth it.

The trip on the Bella Jane was informative and fun thanks to Robert and Henry and we saw a few seals, cormorants and a Heron on the way over. The time on shore was spent exploring the shores of the loch which would be nicer on a less overcast day.

On the way back the hot chocolate was really welcome!

Would easily use this company again as the service from all (especially the skipper) was excellent.",Date of experience: October 2016,Bella Jane Boat Trips & AquaXplore,4,"Isle of Skye, United Kingdom"
Fantastic Fish,"On a rainy cold day we made the trip to the Quayside tempted by tales of seafood rarely seen outside of European cafe's and we were not disappointed.

Sporting a fine menu with choices for the whole family we opted for the east coast fare and ordered Cullen Skink followed by lobster and the dressed Gourdon Crab. At a mere £11.00 the Crab was outstanding value for money and was more than enough. Despite the lure of the burgers my youngest opted for the mixed fried fish and the plate of salmon, prawns and haddock disappeared quickly.

The knowledgeable staff were extremely helpful with our gluten free diner and managed to give us exact information on every dish. Top marks there!

This is an unpretentious restaurant attached to a busy fish and chip shop that just serves excellent seafood. The smells of the sea and the views over the harbour made the visit for this east coast boy.

Check the opening times before you go as its not open all the time but definitely take the trip.",Date of visit: September 2016,Quayside Restaurant & Fish Bar,4,"Gourdon, United Kingdom"
Full day out!,"We spent a full day on the Coba tour with our guide Raul who was full of some extensive information about Coba and the surrounding area.

The ruins themselves are quite small if you've been to Chitchen Itza but are definitely more realistic as ruins, still being encased in jungle and trees. Kids will recognise the setting from the game Temple Run!

The climb to the top is fairly steep and care needs to be taken as it can be busy at the top. The views across the canopy are spectacular.

The day was well managed by Raul and the lunch then visit to a Mayan house kept the kids going. Highlight of the day was swimming at the denote which was in a beautiful setting. Add to this tasting natural chewing gum, being blessed by a Shaman and tasting some tequila it really was quite a trip.",Date of experience: July 2016,Coba Mayan Traditions,4,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico"
Not quite all inclusive,"We booked what was described to us as an all inclusive trip to Xel Ha and on the whole it probably was but there is a vast amount of additional activities which do require payment.

The free stuff could be enough but if you've got kids the temptation to do the other activities is immense.

Snorkelling in the lagoon is awesome with lots of fish and stingrays to see, the water is calm, warm and there's room for everyone. The adventure area is good with zip wires and ropes galore but it can get really busy here. My kids enjoyed the cliffs of courage where they jumped off ledges around 4.5m into the river. We didn't have time for the lazy river

Expect to pay between 35-50 dollars each for all the other activities like zip bikes, snuba, sea treks with a lot more for dolphin or manitou experiences. Take a waterproof camera or a waterproof case for your phone as there is no way to avoid getting wet.

It's a beautiful area with excellent restaurants, bars and facilities but the extras were expensive and took a bit of shine of the day.",Date of experience: July 2016,Xel-Ha Park by Xcaret,4,"Solidaridad, Mexico"
Excellent family holiday,"We stayed two weeks in this resort and were impressed with the grounds and facilities on offer.

The grounds and swimming pools are extremely well maintained and provide ample space for families to relax and enjoy the Mexican sun. There is a choice of pools from quiet spaces to the activities area where you can sit and be entertained. The beach area is equally well set out and provides loads of things to do including free kayaks, games of volleyball and beach soccer. The gym and spa facilities are amazing and can be accessed by everyone with Spa prices very reasonable.

The rooms themselves could do with a bit of attention as they were below the standard I had expected for the price we paid but again we were in our room very little.

We ate at most of the restaurants and the buffet and would definitely recommend the steakhouse and the teppanyaki restaurants. On the whole the food was excellent and the beach grill burgers were absolutely fantastic. Top tip is to book as many nights as you can in the main restaurants.

Take as many small peso notes (20 -100) as you can as larger notes are hard to change and you always need tips!

The hotel runs a shuttle service into Playa del Carmen at 50 pesos each but you can get a taxi for four at a cost of 240 pesos at any time. These are strictly regulated and a fair price for the length of the journey. Get cash out while you're in Playa as the peso machines in the hotel are rarely full.

Enjoy your holiday",Date of stay: July 2016,Grand Riviera Princess,4,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico"
Awesome battle!,"We booked a half day trip with two adults and two kids ( 11 and 13) and were put on a boat ourselves which seemed like a great deal.

After trawling for an hour with only a couple of interested bites we asked to go bottom fishing so that the kids would keep interested. The fun began then with everyone pulling in fish right, left and centre. After another hour my line struck hard and I spent a good ten minutes fighting a large yellowfin tuna which was the highlight of our day.

I would recommend this trip but book direct with the shop as it's much cheaper than going with an agent in your hotel.",Date of experience: July 2016,Captain Ricks Sport Fishing,4,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico"
"Excellent seafood, top class service","On a very busy day our family of four was welcomed into the main dining room around 6.00pm. The service from all of the staff was absolutely outstanding, very friendly and helpful from start to finish.

We chose a sharing starter for four which was a big plate of seafood with a whole lobster, some well prepared mussels and shrimp and some really tasty home made fish fingers. We'd had a big lunch so went straight for dessert and there were some excellent choices on the menu.

I'm very happy with our meal there and would definitely return.",Date of visit: April 2016,Nether Abbey Hotel,4,"North Berwick, United Kingdom"
Great value for takeout,"Despite it being hidden away down a side street this is a good value restaraunt serving decent meals.

The staff are attentive and a bit quirky but do there job really well. We had takeout pizza several times from here and it was really cheap ( 4-5 euros for a 12 inch pizza)",Date of visit: July 2015,Ristorante Moonlight,4,"Sant'Agnello, Italy"
Very hot,"We took an organised tour around Pompeii lasting two hours which was just at the limit of our kids patience.

Having done Vesuvius in the morning it was nice to be on the flat ground and I was glad of my trainers. While you can do this yourself with an audio guide the city itself is so vast (60 acres) we thought the tour would be best.

We learned loads about Ancient Rome and were able to take some good pictures despite the crowds. As with all archaeological sites in Italy the kids were free but if they do look near 18 then proof is required.

There were loads of water fountains so bring your bottle, top tip is to freeze a couple of small bottles overnight as the fountain water is not that cold.

Plenty stalls outside sell water and food if you wish.",Date of experience: July 2015,Pompeii Archaeological Park,4,"Pompeii, Italy"
Fish without the fuss,"A unique rustic experience awaits you in this out of the way restaurant. Huge portions of fresh mussels and soft fried fish provide an ample starter for everyone, add to this a gifted bowl of chickpeas with smoked mackerel meant we were almost full before we began.

The staff have an excellent knowledge of the menu and are more than happy to help you make a choice.

Wine comes in carafes and is good value, water flows freely all night! We took a good two hours in a marathon night of eating and we were not disappointed by any of the food. It can get a bit hot inside so dress appropriately in the summer months",Date of visit: July 2015,Osteria Melafumo,4,"Livorno, Italy"
Rome's past revealed,I'm a fan of history so this stroll around the ruins of Rome was informative and interesting. The ticket came as an add on to our family coliseum visit but the kids had had enough so I ventured on my own. The Palantine hill gardens were a nice stroll and you could sit and have a drink in the shade. ( remember some insect repellent here). The rest of the ruins were impressive to me and its nice to see Italy taking care of its past.,Date of experience: July 2015,Palatine Hill,4,"Rome, Italy"
No Pizza!,"A fantastic restaurant to take a break from tourist fast food. Serving a few regional dishes from Pisa with an emphasis on home made this was a joy. The staff were keen to help us out interpreting the menu and we plumped for the Tuscan soup, pork steak and Rabbitt with olives. It's been years since I've had Rabbitt and this was an absolute treat for me. I washed it down with a half carafe of red and after a wee dessert there was still change from 60 euros!

If you like real food then this is the place to visit, if you're a pizza/pasta tourist then don't bother.",Date of visit: July 2015,Trattoria S. Omobono,4,"Pisa, Italy"
Amazing but expensive,"This was probably the best organised of Italy's monuments and was the easiest to manage. It is however the most expensive for families to visit. If you can't prove your kids are under 11 then you will all pay 18 euros which for a family of 4 was a tad expensive.

The good points are you get a specific time slot and once you have tickets you can go away and wander the streets, have lunch or see the other attractions in the square.

No bags are allowed in the tower but across the grass a free cloakroom allows you to store your bags, cameras are allowed. There is a short explanation at the bottom before a spiral 147 steps takes you to balcony one then around 30 steps to the bell tower. Beautiful architecture and stunning views in a non crowded ( max 35) tower.",Date of experience: July 2015,Leaning Tower of Pisa,4,"Pisa, Italy"
"Great park, but plan your transport","As a waterpark it lacks some of the excitement that others have and the slides can seem a bit tame. There are two rubber ring tubes, 4 single person tubes, two sheer drop slides ( not huge ) and a 6 lane open slide. There are also a few smaller kids slides in one of the pools. That said it's well managed and very safe and has a better atmosphere than some of the parks I have been in before, both my kids ( 10 and 12) were happy.

Where this park exceeds others is in the entertainment offered. At several points throughout the day we had foam parties, a rave in the pool, exercise classes, kids entertainment in the pool and some reasonably priced food!

We arrived in the afternoon and paid 56 euros for a family of 4 and then finally managed to find some shade and an umbrella on a grass bank. You can pay for a gold standard entry and be guaranteed a bed but we chanced it.

The downside for us was getting there. Having followed some directions to get to Cornelia metro stop we then waited for the fabled 906 bus and waited......and waited. After almost an hour we gave up and got a cab which cost 13 euros and took about ten minutes ( much better than the advertised 30 minute bus). On the way back we got the park to call us a cab and again it was only 13 euros. The bus stop is only round the corner to the left of the exit but as with all Italian buses there is no timetable!

If you can arrange your transport this is a fantastic day out!",Date of experience: July 2015,Hydromania,4,"Rome, Italy"
Free and less crowds,"If you are a fan of architecture then this beautiful building is a must. It's free entry and is set in a wonderful square where you can sit and admire.

Free from crowds means in relation to the colloseum and the Vatican. It's still busy but you can move, take your time and generally see what you want to see.

Our kids came and went in and out as we looked over the resting place of Raphael and the stunning architecture.

Not far round the corner is Piazza Navona where you can sip on a vastly overpriced beer or just sit in the square and watch the world go by.",Date of experience: July 2015,Pantheon,4,"Rome, Italy"
Do your homework!,"This can be a good day trip if you do your internet research. I would advise to buy tickets online and if you can print at home even better. Kids still need tickets and online they cost two Euros ( a booking fee ). We went for an audio tour costing 11 euro for two guides and a map and we were off, it took us 15 mins to enter having booked online. Remember it is Rome in July and is punishingly hot, take plenty water(there are taps inside you can fill up with). Be prepared for being jostled and hassled outside by sellers and tour guides and jstled and hassled by tourists inside but it is worth it. The nicest part of the day is using the joint entry to tour the forumad the palantine hill!",Date of experience: July 2015,Colosseum,4,"Rome, Italy"
Ice Hockey for Football daft kids,"We had a fantastic day out at this attraction despite knowing very little about Ice Hockry. Our kids aged 9 and 11 were fascinated by the jerseys and the all star player profiles. The chance to be a goalkeeper and have a go at shooting some pucks kept them amused for ages. I was totally fascinated by the old players cards and seeing the trophy room and the Stanley Cup made it a really special day.

Good tip, pick up a wee info card and get a free Hall of Fame bracelet for the kids.",Date of experience: July 2014,Hockey Hall of Fame,4,"Toronto, Canada"
"Surprise, No Fries!","A haven away from the endless parade of restaurants offering burgers, pizzas and fries, this wonderful Ramen house serves up some authentic and tasty dishes well within the family budget. Sticking to four main dishes they offer noodles to everyone's palate and add some excellent dumplings and extra meat if the carnivore in you isn't happy. The setting on Dundas street is unassuming and the clean and plain interior seats businessmen next to families as we ate our way through a tasty and generous bowl. Such a winner we went twice in a week.",Date of visit: July 2014,Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4,"Toronto, Canada"
Prepare to pay!,We probably chose the wrong day for this trip as we tried to do it on a Saturday and it was absolutely mobbed! The queue for the Ferry was over an hour and as a result we took a Water Taxi which was about ten dollars dearer. The amusement park was a huge disappointment for my kids as all the rides are aimed at very young ones and operate at a horrendously extortionate rate. We hired some bikes which at eight dollars an hour wasn't really the best either. Despite this the island itself is stunning with some beautiful shorelines and gardens and if it hadn't been so crowded would have been awesome. Try and go on a week day to avoid disappointment.,Date of experience: July 2014,Toronto Island Park,4,"Toronto, Canada"
Great hotel in a good location,"We stayed here in July this year and I was very impressed with our room and all the staff who worked in the Hotel. The place is very clean and everything about our room looked like it was almost new. We had a queen room on the seventh floor with two large beds and two televisions perfect for a family of four. The room was serviced daily and the hotels excellent Eco policy was adhered to with recycling collected and towels only when we needed them.

Staff could not have been more helpful, especially the concierge who made sure we didn't get lost in the city. The front desk staff were happy to print all our documents and the internet was easily accessible in the lobby. Free WiFi might have made the hotel more attractive for me but there was a reasonable weekly charge (around forty dollars).
The hotel was a hop away from Dundas square and within easy walking distance of loads of attractions and restaurants. Forget the airport shuttle as the hotel limo can whizz you to Pearson faster and as the movie says for only a Few Dollars More.",Date of stay: July 2014,Bond Place Hotel,4,"Toronto, Canada"
Fully stuffed! Crepes and Kids!,Took both our kids ( 9 and 11 ) for breakfast here and found that we could barely move after consuming an amazing stuffed crepe. Sweet and savoury were both on offer with a good choice of daily specials even at that time in the morning. Service was as good as we have come to expect in Canada and my coffee was just what I needed. A bit on the expensive side for breakfast compared to the UK but we skipped lunch as we had eaten so much!,Date of visit: July 2014,The Crepe House,4,"Port Dover, Canada"
Massive meals!,"Spent a nice evening in here eating with the kids. The portion sizes were huge and we ate enough to sink the ship! I felt they could make more of the fact that the fish is local and done a bit more than just fry it, everything seemed to come in a nice even brown coating. It was still a very good meal but I wanted a bit more from this promising place.",Date of visit: July 2014,Fisherman's Catch Bar,4,"Port Dover, Canada"
Zippy Day Doo Dah!,"What an awesome day my son and I had on the zip lines. Dutchie and Drew could not have been nicer hosts as we learned how to work the wires. All the interesting information on the way round helped to make this a tour as well as an adventure. As for the Zipping well it was incredible, particularly the last Bombers Run at 800ft ! We had an absolute blast, back soon for a half day kayaking.",Date of experience: July 2014,Long Point Eco-Adventures,4,"Turkey Point, Canada"
Great Sunday Family Lunch,The well appointed menu didn't disappoint any of our party of four adults and three kids and they were more than happy to adjust some of the kids meals. A great family atmosphere and the Sunday roasts were all superb. The Med has undergone several transformations over the last few years and I feel now they've struck a good balance. Staff were great and when I went online I was surprised to receive a 25% discount voucher which really meant the kids ate free. There is a plethora of good eating places in Bridge of Allan and now the Med is really able to compete with the best of them. We'll all be back again!,Date of visit: May 2014,The Meadowpark Pub & Kitchen,4,"Bridge of Allan, United Kingdom"
Great place for a family outing,"A great place to spend a sunny afternoon with the kids, a free playground and always full of of other frazzled parents trying to find things for the kids to do. The added bonus is the reasonably priced food and the opportunity in the summer months to pick fresh fruit and take it home.

The play area has trampolines, some go karts ( in need of a bit of repair if I'm honest ) , a smaller track for young kids, a zip wire, a multi play area and a giant fort that my boys love to run around. There's always a football kicking about and you can happily spend an hour or two watching the world go by.

There are seats inside and out and a small farm shop if you want the taste of Angus to stay with you just that bit longer.

The best bit........no charge for the play area!!!",Date of experience: July 2013,Charleton Fruit Farm,4,"Montrose, United Kingdom"
