Fabulous!,"With beautiful surroundings this site gives you peace and tranquility for your camping experience. The pitches are large and spacious, we stayed on ""Fern"", giving you plenty of room to feel as if you are alone camping in meadows. Each pitch is partly surrounded by hedgerows and juvenile willow hedging, making for good shelter and lovely sounds as the winds blow.
The fire pit and a plentiful supply of logs gives you the opportunity to enjoy sitting out late at night and with little or no light polution you can enjoy stargazing and appreciate the beautiful night sky.
The undercover table allows you to spend time outdoors no matter what the weather chooses to do.
Lee & Abi have not missed a detail! Recycling bins, food waste, wheelbarrow for carrying your water carrier and logs, axe for cutting kindling and of course the ""Diddy Little Shop"" in case you forget your firelighters, marshmallows or popcorn.
For families there is a great childrens playground, probably one of the best maintained ones I have seen.
For the dogs there are great meadows and woodlands to ramble and enjoy, one field allows the dogs to free run and enjoy their holiday too. Plenty of discrete dog ""poop"" bins meaning the whole area was exceptionally clean and cared for.
As we visited during Coronavirus problems, we were happy to enjoy our own showering and toilet facilities.
Lee & Abi have done a fantastic job of creating a feeling of cleanliness and safety in these uncertain times.",Date of stay: September 2020,COASTAL MEADOWS - AWARD WINNING CAMPING - CAMPFIRES - NR COASTAL WOOD & BEACHES,1,"Amroth, United Kingdom"

A real jewel in Kefonias crown,"From the moment we arrived we were made to feel so welcome. From the lovely Rosemary scented gardens and the authentic charm to the genuine Greek hospitality this little gem of a hotel has it all. Supra Stella cooks some amazing local specialities whilst Labros excels at his meat or fish barbeques. The fantastic VFM room rate is all you pay, there are no hidden extras to pay for.

Day of fun and laughter,"Fabulous day spent with Danny & Lisa, such great hosts.
A gentle morning cruise enjoying sights and sounds. The mud experience is certainly not something you find every day in Kefalonia but great fun!
Lovely lunch on board before enjoying the afternoon winds and making sail. Nothing better than a peaceful afternoon listening to the sails and shared with great people.
Thank you Danny & Lisa it was a perfect day!",Date of experience: September 2018,IraklisSailing,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely weekend,"Lovely site located a short but tough walk from a peaceful secluded beach. Very busy due to a swim/cycle/run event taking place locally. The staff worked really hard to maintain cleanliness in the on site facilities, pity some families can't ensure their children do the same. There was also a school from Bolton on site. The head teacher should be very proud of those boys, they were polite and extremely well behaved. Very warm welcome on arrival and nice to be able to choose our own pitch. Although lovely that the on site shop supports local goods, it would be nice to be able to buy more mainstream items without needing to travel off site.",Date of stay: July 2018,Trevayne Farm Caravan and Camping,1,"Saundersfoot, United Kingdom"
Lovely weekend on a happy site!,"From the moment of our arrival we were made to feel really welcome!
Lovely clean site with loads of room for our 4 grandchildren to play and roam safely.
We had an issue with a large group being very noisy late, but it was handled quickly, tactfully and efficiently with very sincere apologies offered.
All the management and staff were constantly on hand if only for a chat.
Lovely touch having the bar for a ""sundowner"", pity it was closed Saturday evening as we were leaving Sunday morning. Great to have the firepits for a lovely glowing fire into the evening.

Lovely day but,"Lovely day with family wandering around and enjoying our heritage. Curator staff lovely, very knowledgeable and happy to educate. Still waiting for ""The Vulcan""? Wonder how long before we can enjoy that too. Downside to the visit was how unreasonably expensive basic food and drink was. The shop doesn't really cater for ""pocket money"" budgets either.

Fantastic Day,"A fabulous day spent on board enjoying the stunning coast and sea of Cephalonia. Stopping to swim, snorkel and enjoy the therpeutic mud, very good for the skin I was told.

Very disappointed,"Recommended by someone on Kefalonia Unplugged we looked forward to our visit. Had the days special of chicken. It was very poor! Sadly I thought it to be overpriced.

Quaint & Charming,"Small, friendly and charming building a stones throw from the Castle. It's age does mean it's a rather quirky establishment with tiny narrow stairs and doors. Very warm welcome on arrival.
Room was tired and in need of some TLC but more than adequate for our needs. Lovely fresh white bedding although some of the towels need replacing. The floor was ""undulating"" in places that made for an eventful trip to the bathroom in the middle of the night.
Breakfast was freshly cooked and tasty using good quality products. The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming.",Date of stay: August 2017,The Woodfield Arms,1,"Chepstow, United Kingdom"

Devils in the detail,"Lovely welcome on site with large pitch areas. Grass and borders kept neat and tidy. Each field had their own shower and toilet block although at busy times I can see that there could be a problem as on our field there were just 2 toilets and showers with an additional family/disable one. Superficially clean, but thorough cleaning could be improved. Not a major problem though just details. The shop is well stocked and reasonably priced. The animal walk is a lovely extra, it was nice to be woken by the donkeys braying. In general a good inexpensive site.",Date of stay: August 2017,Lleithyr Farm Carvan and Camping Holidays,1,"St. Davids, United Kingdom"
Great little Gem!,"1st visit with a friend for some ""catch up time"" with a friend. Made to feel very welcome! I've seen some rotten reviews and can honestly say I did not encounter any of the issues previous reviews met with. Although a Tuesday night it was still busy but we did not have to wait for long for our fabulous food. My Cypriot Salad was FAB! Even iF there had been a long delay waiting for food it was worth it. Besides which those familiar with eating ""Greek"" know that if you are impatient to get your food..... you really don't have enough time to properly enjoy and savour the Greek experience. Well Done Hellic Eatery I will definately be returning!",Date of visit: February 2017,The Hellenic Eatery,1,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"
Beautiful Family Run Hotel,"From the moment we arrived the welcome was as big as the view. Lovely welcoming fast check in. Our cases were whisked off to our room while the owner, Billy gave us his welcome chat. Our room was lovely, all rooms have sea view, lovely large balcony on which to enjoy the sun rise. Our room and indeed everywhere around the hotel was immaculately clean with some pretty decor. Every single member of staff were efficient, friendly and good fun to be around. Particularly Yanni the resident entertainer (that should read barman, but he is so much more than a barman) brought everyone together in the evenings making for some great company and good fun. We were sad to leave but will return next year for more of the same.

Big Macs Wholly Soul Band,"We stayed following a great night of live music with the above band. The 3 course meal was hot, fresh and ample portions. Dan and his young team were friendly, helpful and enthusiatic. Well Done guys!
Our room was small and dated but had a fabulous view over the gardens and hills beyond. Really poor quilt and pillows, although linen was beautifully clean. Bathroom again small but perfectly acceptable. The shower over the bath not the best but had plenty of piping hot water. Lovely large fluffy white towels. Any of the minor faults were unerstandable ""quirks"" of the beautiful old building.

Well done all!",Date of visit: January 2016,The Merrie Harrier,1,"Penarth, United Kingdom"
Fabulous Holiday at Fabulous Hotel,"Having booked our holiday quite some time ago we were getting very concerned after reading some very unpleasant reviews. My conclusion? Some people just love to moan about absolutely nothing or minor things.
On arrival we were greeted by a lovely young lady at reception, welcomed with a drink and escorted to our room by ""Buggy"" with a charming driver who spent time showing us around before arriving at our room. Great guy! Every time we encountered him during our stay he acknowledged us with a very cheery greeting.
Our room was a Bungalow with limited sea view, but an absolutely smashing location. It was large, cool and spotlessly clean (lovely Elafonifi)she took great care of us all week and works extremely hard! The air con worked really well and maintained a lovely cool atmosphere for us the whole holiday.
The restaurant was very busy but everyone took the time and trouble to speak if spoken to. The food was fresh, hot, plentiful, varied and of very good quality.
The main bar was OK there was a gentleman there that wasn't always very personable, but then we can all have ""Off Days"". The theatre bar and Calypso bar were fab. Doris & George seemed to make it their mission to make us over indulge on alcohol and we did!. Word of warning alcohol measures are generous to say the least.
The animation team are probably one of the very best I have ever encountered, Simone, Tony, Yuri, Mariella, Vicki, Mauro what can I say??? they are a fantastic bunch of energetic youngsters who strive to give you an amazing time. Their interpretation of the Lion King was stunning. Simone even took the trouble to find a Sports Bar for us to watch the rugby as we felt the hotel bar was maybe a bit inappropriate for 2 enthusiastic ""Welshies"" when playing England. Thank you very Much Simone! You should be very proud of your team!
The grounds are beautifully maintained and very pretty for an early morning or evening stroll. Even the gardeners took the trouble to chat.
The general manager seemed to always be around (Does he ever have a day off? I suspect not)
We celebrated our wedding anniversary and my birthday whilst there and was very touched to find cakes, chocolates and champagne set out in our room on the their respective days. I was very touched by this gesture.
I had a fantastic holiday and hope that people contemplating this hotel look beyond the spiteful and unfair criticisms made. You will never find the ""All Perfect Hotel"" but this could well compete for that title.
Thank you all very much for an mazing holiday!!!",Date of stay: September 2015,Iberostar Creta Panorama & Mare,1,"Crete, Greece"
Better places to visit than here,Though a fair way away from our hotel we did visit it briefly. we found it to be decidedly sccruffy & grubby and didn't make a return trip.,Date of experience: November 2014,Kardamena Beach,1,"KÃ³s, Greece"
"Again, a brilliant time","Yet again our family enjoyed a great day out at Folly Farm. Though we visit many times over a year, we never tire of the experience. Always impressed by EVERY single member of staff, they all work tirelessly to ensure you have great day. Always spotlessly clean and kept clean neat & tidy all day.
The animals are all fabulous examples of their species and kept in superb environments.
Food outlets offer good fare at reasonable prices but for those who wish to picnic there are ample areas and seating.
Children's play areas and climbing frames are some of the best I have seen anywhere.
WELL DONE FOLLY FARM!!",Date of experience: August 2015,Folly Farm,1,"Begelly, United Kingdom"
Dreadful Avoid,"Having enjoyed some lovely food and coffees here last Summer I decided to take my Mum for lunch.
There was none of the nice friendly welcome we had previously enjoyed, just an icy glare whilst I helped my aged disabled Mum get seated. Looking at the menu, where had all the beautiful food selection I remember from my previous visit?
Menu choice very poor, boring and over priced!
One positive.... it is much better without the spiral stairs.

We decided to leave.... disappointed!
My recommendation for an alternative with excellent home made
Food, and a warm welcome go to ""Victoria Tea Rooms"" on Cornerswell Road",Date of visit: July 2015,Penarth Pier Pavilion,1,"Penarth, United Kingdom"
Not all it promised to be,"My expectations of this hotel were very high when booking as it is purported to be 5T, the reality was somewhat different and personally would only rate as 4T.
Having contacted the hotel directly before my departure date with a query regarding some concerns I had about some Trip Advisor Reiews, I was assured the rooms were of an excellent standard I should be reassured.
However, our delux room turned out to be not so much delux as ""Standard"".
Room
Booked as delux, it didn't offer delux amenities I'm afraid. The terrace had a dreadful view with poor sunbeds on a open lawned area offerng no privacy at all. Neighbouring children next door and above viewed it as ""Communal"" space. At night the irrigation system for this lawneed area started and left muddy puddles thorughout the next day due to poor drainage. This in turn encouraged a plethora of bugs into our room. In general the room seemed dull, uniinspring and dingy, and dare I say Grubby. The towels were were very poor (not delux standard). However, on a positive note the aged bathrobes and new slippers were welcome as was the drinks supplied in the fridge. The bed however was one of the best beds I have ever slept in so the room did redeem itself somewhat.
Food
Excellent quality and plenty of it, though at busy times empty trays were quite slow to be refilled. The dining room was pleasant with a choice of inside/outside seating, but the outside seating really do need cushons for the seats because after sitting on them for the duaration of your meal you had the wicker seat imprint on your legs for some hours after. I was disappoined to note that despite the brochure and the hotel welcome pack pointing out that there was a dress code for the restaurant in the evenings, it wasn't followed. Again as a 5T you would expect certain standards. Additionally, pushchairs were allowed to be brought into the restaurant whch with close proximity seating can and did cause people already eating their meal to have to move. It really isn't necessary for puschairs in the dining room as there was an ample supply of high chairs and booster cushions. My son his wife and 2 children travelled to this hotel last year and said they were not permittted to take puschairs into the dining room and that the dress code for evenings was adhered to. The dining room staff were amazing, excellent personalities and service, in particular Fotis and Slovena. The daytime snackbar was again fantastic!! Excellent food, excellent staff and spotlessly clean.
Bar
Amazing staff, great personalities making excellent drinks. Linda in particular looked after not just us but everyone in the bar during the evening.
Entertainment
Little or nothing for ""grown ups"" after 10pm. The music in the bar was not to our taste, maybe others. The entertainment area for adult entertainment after the childrens earlier session was badly laid out and left untidy. It would make for a much better experience for ""grown ups"" in more intmate setting ie 4-6 chairs around a table instead of the existiing theatre lay out. Very quickly and easily arranged after kids club. But even the enterainment here stopped very early. The Greek Night Entertainers were excellent we enjoyed them very much!! But then returned the the bar with a guitarist playing miserable music.
Pool
The hotel welcome pack asked that people did not reserve sunbeds around the pool! Most morniings the majority of sunbeds had towels on them by 7am. I personally saw large groups (ie 4-6 beds) having towels on them from 7am and no
one returned to them until after lunch??
Car Hire
Savaas was brilliant with his advice and iirections to things to see and do. Price was again excellent.
Recepton
Fabulous friendly staff, efficient check in though we did have to wait for a shuttle buggy to our room.
In general we had a pleasant stay and if I had expected a 4T hotel I would rate this higher. But, 5T Delux room? I cannot rate any higher.",Date of stay: May 2015,Atlantica Aegean Blue Resort,1,"Rhodes, Greece"

Concerns Unfounded,"Prior to my holiday, 21\9\14, I read a lot of reviews which now I can only think of as malicious. I contacted the manager directly with some concerns after reading the nasty reviews, and can say his response was SO positive and helpful. Even taking time out of his busy day to meet with us.
It would be very unfair to give praise to one single member of staff as they were all FANTASTIC!
Service on all levels was 1st rate.
Rooms are a little dated, but spotlessly clean, and cleaned every day.

All staff from the moment of arrival to departure were friendly and approachable. The childrens entertainers worked extremely hard giving kids of all ages great fun filled days and evenings. I can highly recommend the Sunday Roast Carvery, more than enough to fill even the hungriest appetites.

WONDERFUL HELP DURING DISTRESSING TIME,"We chose to stay here after a disasterous stay at ""NORBRECK CASTLE "" 2 weeks earlier.
We were staying to attend my brothers funeral. I arrived with my frail elderly Mum and from the moment we explained our circumstances to the reception staff we were afforded every help and assistance. The staff's care and compassion was way above and beyond their normal duties. From giving us privacy when needed to maps for locating the crematorium to arranging an early check into my daughters room on the morning of the funeral...... Nothing was too much trouble!

Welcomed with plenty of Mulled wine, teas, coffes, squash, sausage rolls, mince pies, biscuits.............. and not a penny extra to pay! A WARM COSY ROOM, Children able to play whilst we wait for an immaculate train to arrive to go off in search of Jack Frost and his magic badges.
We were never rushed the children enjoyed Santas story and receiving gifts (Brilliant quality books & toys).

The room was spacious and comfortable, the hospitality was warm and friendly, the views were spectacular, and the food (including home-baked bread) was excellent. Manor Farm is about halfway between Avebury and Salisbury, near Marlborough. coming from Salisbury. The turn-off is harder to see from the Avebury direction.

A distressing Time made worse by AWFUL Hotel,"Having been called to Blackpool to attend to my VERY sick brother I booked this hotel purely for location.
Sadly my brother passed away. 24 hours after my arrival. Did the Norbreck Castle"" care? NO! After explaining the situation to a generically trained receptionist, we were expected to check out as normal at 10am (including my frail elderly mother) leave our bags at reception until they could find us a room later in the day. Clearly expecting a bereaved family to wander ""homeless"" until they followed their procedures. Many many other issues too many to go into detail but suffice to say at no time were we ever offered any help or assistance given that we were terribly upset in a strange hotel without a direct support network. No offer of assistance at all! At the very least you would expect a modicum of human compassion and kindness.",Date of stay: November 2011,Norbreck Castle Hotel,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"

Lovely Asimina,"Fed up of tour operators rubbish hotels we booked ""Asiminas"" to try to get a flavour of typical Greek hospitality, and we wern't disappointed! Asimina was lovely! Very welcoming even though her English and my Greek was sketchy. The studios were spotlessly clean with everything you needed. Asimina was always pottering around her garden which gave an air of safety and security. I would give caution to using the nearby Oasis apartments as when we visited we found it to be very Tatty, and grubby and not at all welcoming.

A rare jewel,"It is very rare these days to find standards as high as this Park offers, in both park maintenance and customer service. I did encounter a few issues, but the way my concerns were addressed and handled were excellent, well above average. Problems encountered are rarely a problem so long as they are addressed efficiently and promptly! All staff were extremely approachable and ready to listen and rectify. Being grandparents with 2 x 3 year olds, the location and facilities were excellent. A short stroll to the beach or some party games in the family bar (Well Done Gayle!) gave us everything to entertain the little ones whilst enjoying the ambiance of our surroundings. Our accommodation was beautiful, clean, well located and afforded us everything we might need. I am told there are plans for a restaurant/food outlet. Good idea! but please make it in keeping with such delightful high standards you already adhere to. Anyone wanting takeway style food could always order it in from Cardigan, we found a few who would be delighted to deliver! The pool and pool area is one of the best I have ever enjoyed here and abroad, Well Done!
Small point for future note, might I suggest a ""Rogues Gallery""of staff to include their names in reception. A small point but in my experience putting names to faces can often be a major contributor to allaying complaints and encourages compliments.
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR A MOST ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE AND STAY!",Date of stay: June 2011,Cardigan Bay Holiday Park,1,"St. Dogmaels, United Kingdom"
Trying to be something it's not and can never be!,"Chose this hotel purely for its location and it didn't disappoint! Stunning breathtaking views out over Skiathos town. THATS WHERE MY PRAISE ENDS!
The rooms are extremely dated and shoddy, given this hotel advertises itself as 4*. We all know Greek standards of stars but even by those standards it failed miserably. Our room only ever had a cursory clean in the entire week of our stay. Under the beds were very dusty and covered in hair. No CD players as advertised. The bathroom taps broke repeatedly and the bath was unusable.

We booked half board but had to complete a menu choice each evening straight after eating a very poor dinner. Our 1st night we were given the Al La Carte menu (Pretty poor food) only to be told we shouldn't have had that food. Very loudly for all to hear, and told we should have filled out a menu choice earlier in the day.Most embarassing! The menu hardly varied day to day so gave up on it and ate out most evenings.

The shuttle bus was infrequent and always full with only one trip being made, thank goodness we had a car!
Breakfast was a typical Greek buffet affair but very poor! The staples i.e cereals, jams etc were never cleared away and left on the buffet table until the next breakfast. Often containing wasps! Coffee was poor and always cold! Hot breakfast was made up of mostly eggs fried, boiled, omelette and something else that I couldn't quite fathom!
The pool area was inadequate and as the hotel was barely half full there never seemed to be enough space or sunbeds.

The owners never gave the impression of wanting to speak to us and often took over along with their family the prime seating areas around the pool, bar and lounge.

With the exception of one or two staff the majority were rude surely and very poor at their job.

Bar prices extortionate! 8 euros for a whiskey & coke! Cheapest bottle of wine? 24euros?

The owners maybe an architect and an interior designer BUT!!!!
A beautiful canvas to start with but the owners have tried too hard to be something its not and can never be. Too much 'Faff & Fancy' not enough attention to details such as cleanliness and service.",Date of stay: September 2010,Kivo Art & Gourmet Hotel,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
