Lovely meal and superb team,"A lovely meal was had last night, the food was excellent as was the team. Special mention to the manager and the chap ( shorts!) who took care of us. Loads of energy and personality. Will be back in October and can't wait for our booking on NYE!",Date of visit: August 2020,Porthminster Beach Cafe,1,"St Ives, United Kingdom"
"Great views and setting, amazingly overpriced for average fare","What a great job the owners have done with the build and setting, the gardens are beautiful as is the space itself. It all screams quality but I'm afraid that's where it stops. The food and drink is insanely overpriced. £17 for a cosmopolitan is daylight robbery, I won 2 cocktail bars in London and that is a serious mark up, some of their cocktails go up to £25! That is pricey anywhere in unless you are in Mayfair. The food too was way overpriced for small portions, late £20's to mid £30's for mains, pork belly (3 small cubes) and duck ( half a small breast at best), £15 for 3 cheese's with more grapes and chutney than cheese! to charge that sort of price for cheese you need a cheese trolley served table side. The food itself is average at best and lacking care and seasoning. The chef is trying way to hard fancifying dishes rather than think about taste and value for money. The service was surly with zero personality, the staff were more interested in loudly setting up for breakfast than looking after guests. After coming to St Ives multiple times every year for the last 25 years I was really looking forward to coming here, loving it and newly adding it to the list of places we come to on every visit. Could be an amazing place but fleecing customers because you have a nice view is not cool.",Date of visit: August 2020,Restaurant 1894,1,"Carbis Bay, United Kingdom"

Superb as always,"We go to Poros every year and this is by far the best Fish Restaurant in town. Always buzzing and full. Service is quality.

Nice but dark,Great place but hard to find ( probably the point of a secret bar) but too dark and drinks Weren't amazing just ok.,Date of experience: June 2017,Karova Music Club,1,"Warsaw, Poland"
Awful,"Booked a table for breakfast even though they were quiet but the table wasn't ready. Surly host who seemed to be in charge was not bothered and looked like she would rather be in bed. Cheer up you're meant to making people happy.

A cup of tea and orange took as long as our burnt breakfast 20 mins and that was only after the host shouted "" are these done??"" Hardly keeping her incompetence down!

No care or attention and we were one of only a few tables

A disgrace considering how nice it could be and the location

Only slight saving grace was a polite chap who was the only one doing any work

Avoid",Date of visit: July 2017,Porthgwidden Beach Cafe,1,"St Ives, United Kingdom"
Now Average used to be brilliant,"Being going here for 20 years + and now nowhere near as good as back then. For the last 5-6 the menus stayed the same pretty much. They have a lovely garden but don't use it, it seems.

Oysters served on tin foil isn't a good look and mains far to big

Instead of spending money on a new al fresco area spend it on the menu to match the view.",Date of visit: July 2017,Porthminster Beach Cafe,1,"St Ives, United Kingdom"
Beautiful,"Brilliant place, great food, good selection of drinks/ cocktails/ wine, Cosy decor and service was great
