Perfect day!,"We booked this trip via the gift shop on the walk down to the beach from our hotel. We wanted something different from the usual boat trips and we wasn't disappointed. We boarded the boat at 8am at Katelios harbour and were welcomed by Dimitrios and Efi. They are a lovely couple and we felt like family rather than tourists. There is a maximum of ten people per trip and on our day there was eight of us and we all got along really well. Once we left the harbour, we were presented with bread and gorgeous homemade marmalade, biscuits and tea and coffee. You then watch Dimitrios start pulling in the nets and you then see what fish has been caught overnight. Efi then untangles them from the nets, you can help if you wish or just watch and learn whilst taking in the beautiful scenery. Once all the nets are in you can swim off the boat to a small beach whilst the fish is prepared for lunch. Efi then amazingly cooks the fish to perfection on limited facilities. Amongst our catch we had parrot fish, red snapper, cuttlefish and two small lobster! Back on the boat for lunch which was served with Greek salad, potatoes and bread together with homemade wine. Totally delicious! After lunch you are taken to another beach for a swim if you wish or you can stay on the boat and chat with Efi and Dimitrios and other guests. You return to Katelios harbour around 3pm. This is a fantastic trip made special by Efi and Dimitrios and a must for anyone visiting kefalonia. Highly recommended. Thank you both.

Perfect Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for two weeks and have just returned. The hotel is perfect, rooms are lovely and cleaned daily. Sakis and his team are wonderful hosts very friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. The pool area is lovely, plenty of sun beds and a pool bar. Undercover seating area where breakfast is served and meals throughout the day. Food is excellent and weekly BBQ is great value for money. The hotel is in a lovely quiet location about 15 minutes walk from beach with lots of tavernas and few bars. This was a lovely relaxing holiday which we cannot fault and would definitely stay here again. Thank you.",Date of stay: July 2018,Pacifae Golden Village,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Beautiful apartments!,"We have just returned from two weeks at Zozefina. These are lovely family run apartments, very spacious, spotlessly clean and modern decor. The owners are so friendly and welcoming and will do anything for you. They are situated on the main road, which is shame as there is road noise and unfortunately for me was a problem. However the walk into town was about 20mins and if you go through the back streets it's lovely and although they are situated on a hill this was okay for us and did not cause any problems. The pool area is lovely with outside toilets and shower facilities, plenty of sun beds and also a jacuzzi. There is a nice bar snack menu which is adequate for breakfast and lunch. We enjoyed lots of walks through olive groves and found hidden churches. This,was my fourth visit to Parga, last being seven years ago. I am pleased to say it still maintains it's charm and the only real change was the invasion of sun beds on all the beaches! Zozefina is a lovely base for your holiday as no where is very far. My only downside is the main road.",Date of stay: July 2017,Zozefina Apartments,1,"Parga, Greece"
Traditional greek taverna,"Great menu choice, lovely surroundings and friendly waiters. off the beaten track away from the busy harbour.",Date of visit: July 2017,Perivoli Restaurant,1,"Parga, Greece"
Our favourite !,"Lovely family run taverna on quiet back road to the harbour. Traditional greek food plenty of choice, and lovely waiters.",Date of visit: July 2017,Yannis Taverna,1,"Parga, Greece"
Disaster buffet!,"We visited this restaurant with two friends last week. There is a buffet twice a week and we happened to go on one of those nights. I think this was a mistake as it was not very enjoyable. There was no space between the tables as they had crammed so many in. They managed to seat you as soon as you arrive but then we had to wait a long while to order drinks. After doing so the waitress said you can get buffet now. After a challenging walk round tables and other diners we queued for the buffet. Nothing was labelled so you didn't know what you were selecting. Lots,of dishes had run out as they couldn't keep up with demand so another congestion formed whilst people waited for trays to be re stocked. The desert dishes were not separate or marked so we ended up with pineapple fritters with our rice as they looked like chicken balls! When the noodles finally arrived and we got back to our seats they were cold. We could find no prawn crackers, would have been nice to have already on the table. From other reviews I think maybe the set menu on a non buffet night may have been a safer choice!",Date of visit: July 2017,Shanghai Chinese restaurant,1,"Parga, Greece"
Perfect!,"Just returned from two weeks at this lovely hotel. What a gem, perfect location with lovely views of the port. Rooms spotless, cleaned every day staff always on hand to help and very friendly. Pool area lovely with lots of shade and tables and chairs. Breakfast buffet had plenty of choice to set you up for the day. Would have liked a kettle to make tea/coffee in room but we bought one from hardware store round corner and that was no problem. A safe deposit in room would have been nice as there wasn't enough for everyone in reception area. The hotel is within easy walking distance of tavernas and supermarkets. The port is only a 5 minute walk where you can book many trips either by boat or coach. Our favourite cafe/bar was 'Swell' on the right of the main beach front painted blue so you can't miss it. The staff were amazing and lovely free nibbles with your drinks. We had an amazing holiday and would love to stay at this hotel again as it's so perfect for us. Thank you.",Date of stay: July 2016,Ionia Hotel Skopelos,1,"Skopelos, Greece"
Great find!,"This is an excellent cafe/bar which we discoverd whilst on a walk about. The staff are so friendly and the food is excellent. You get an amazing variety of free nibbles to go with your mythos or wine! The setting is perfect to chill and watch the world go by. It's open from 10am to 2am and caters for everyone. Am certainly missing this place now I am home!
You must visit at least once during your holiday! Thank you Swell Bar for making,us so welcome, Mark & Dawn Essex. X",Date of experience: July 2016,Swell Coffee Bar,1,"Skopelos, Greece"
Disappointing!,"My birthday lunch was very disappointing, total disorganisation from the start. Was a lovely day and as they now advertise 'al fresco' dining we chose to eat outside, as did many others. However they obviously are unable to cope with both indoor and outdoor diners! Our nibbles while we wait arrived with the starters! The mains didn't arrive together and were cold, the fishcake didn't have any fish, and 4 drinks took 90mins to arrive! There was a reduction in the final bill but on reflection I wish we had left and not paid. Shame as this was one of our favourites, won't be returning.",Date of visit: May 2015,The Hawk,1,"Battlesbridge, United Kingdom"
Valentine Treat!,"Lovely valentine meal. There was a set menu but a choice of three starters, three mains and four deserts together with champagne on arrival, two soup 'shots' and a cleansing sorbet, for Â£30.00 per head. The restaurant was decorated beautifully to suit the occasion. Very friendly and helpful staff and the food was delicious. Was nice to meet the chef in person and will definitely be returning soon. Highly recommended.",Date of visit: February 2015,Blackwater Bistro,1,"Mayland, United Kingdom"
"Perfect holiday, stunning views!","Have just returned from 2 weeks at this hotel. Our room had sea views and this was stunning! The staff are very friendly and Yannis who manages the pool bar and cooked lovely food, is fantastic and very friendly. The rooms are spacious and very clean. There is a steep walk up to the hotel from the main resort centre but is well worth it, torch recommended. Some walked down but got taxi back. If you walk left from the hotel you come to a bus stop, take a right here and just pass the bend on the right you will see steps, 253 to be precise, up to a tiny church. Most of this has a hand rail and is well worth going, the views are stunning and there is plenty of shade, make sure you take water and your camera! There are plenty of Tavernas just before the main resort centre which is very busy. Our favourite was Anixis, which you could see from our balcony. This is family run and the waiters are lovely, one is a Greek ""Arnie"" and one we'll never forget! Perfect holiday, will definitely be back!",Date of stay: July 2014,Hotel Ziakis,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
George Hotel Nidri. 30/6/13-14/07/13,"We have just returned from a two week holiday at the George Hotel Nidri. The Hotel is very clean and you can have clean towels everyday if you need them. There is however, very limited cupboard and drawer space for your clothes. The staff are very friendly and helpful although the only time I spoke to Maria was when I handed our room keys in on departure! The breakfast is very basic, the same everyday and no choice of cereal or Greek yoghurt, but filled a gap. The hotel is situated 5 min walk from the busy Main Street, and this is enough to make it very peaceful and just far enough away from the bars and nightclubs. The beach is quite narrow and pebbly but has everything you need and only a 10min flat walk away, as is the harbour and tavernas. You are spoilt for choice with eating places and they all try for your custom, once you have eaten there though you are then their friends! Our favourite on the harbour was Roots, first on the left as you turn into the port, fantastic value, friendly staff and perfect food! Also the Apollon, a little further along, exceeded our expectations. If you like the traditional Greek, take the turning off the main road opposite the church and go to Fantastica, it's a family run taverna, with a lovely elderly Greek lady welcoming you as soon as you arrive. This is fantastic value for money and outstanding food, especially the breakfast special omelette! This is what Greece is all about. There a lots of boat trips to keep you occupied and also just to the right of the hotel, and a pleasant 45min flat walk will take you to the stunning waterfall, well worth a visit. Don't forget to have a drink in the taverna at the bottom when you leave, it's well worth it. This is the perfect place to relax and unwind, and we spent many an afternoon/evening at the 'la minute' bar people watching, and watching the boats returning from their day trips. Perfect!",Date of stay: July 2013,G. George,1,"Lefkada, Greece"
Perfect!,"We have just returned from 2 weeks at the Imerti Hotel Skala Kalloni Lesvos. This was a perfect holiday and the hotel was a lovely family run complex. Very friendly and could not do enough for you. Very clean and recently refurbished rooms to a very high standard. The hotel is in a perfect location, approx 15 min walk from lovely beach which has very shallow waters ideal for children. Approx 10 min walk from harbour front with lovely friendly and very reasonably priced tavernas. Recommend the Akti Bar for drinks and snacks and Sampos, Dyonisis and Ambrosia (by the church)Tavernas. A must for all greek lovers! Will definetely go back soon!",Date of stay: July 2012,Imerti Resort Hotel,1,"Lesbos, Greece"
