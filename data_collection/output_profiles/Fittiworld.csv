Honeymoon at Doryssa,"Second visit to Doryssa this year. Came in June and got engaged so had to come back for honeymoon. Doryssa gave us a lovely surprise of loads of fresh fruit and a bottle of bubbly, a really nice touch and well received.
We love this hotel as it perfectly suits our Samos experience. We had bed and breakfast board as there is such a huge selection of great restaurants and bars in Pythagorion which is about a 15 min walk or 5 euro taxi. The breakfast is amazing, loads of choice of hot and cold and typical Greek cold dishes, that kept us going for hours. Each to their own but I cannot imagine having all inclusive as the choices both in the hotel and especially outside are really good. Last June I was struck by the staff, always smiling and nothing is too much effort, a few months on and nothing has changed, I hope they enjoy their close season break, they deserve it.
I could pick fault with the characterless AI bar but I will not as there is always somewhere else to go if you don’t like it.
To summarise, thank you Doryssa for an amazing honeymoon, I can’t wait to return to Samos and Doryssa next year.",Date of stay: September 2019,Doryssa Seaside Resort,4,"Samos, Greece"
Simply the best....,"Amazing boat trip with Yiannis and Nancy on honeymoon holiday. What an experience, 10 of us started and by the end of the day we were all friends. Yiannis had so much time for everyone and Nancy’s cooking was first class. Everybody caught fish and they were all prepared and cooked on board and enjoyed by all.
The 440hp engine gets you there very fast so had lots more time fishing and swimming in beautiful location than other trips I have tried.
I can not recommend these lovely people highly enough, so go ahead and treat yourself to this trip.
Can’t wait for next years trip but I fear booking will be required...",Date of experience: September 2019,Samos Fishing Trips,4,"Samos, Greece"
Excellent dining experience,"Really buzzy cafe/restaurant offering a fairly small but very tasty menu at very reasonable prices. I had chorizo and bacon hash which was delicious and a big bowl cost about £8. They had a huge selection of cakes which looked amazing but I was too full to try a bit, will be back to put that right.",Date of visit: September 2019,No.33 Cafe Bar,4,"Norwich, United Kingdom"
Still very good...,"This is our second visit to this excellent resort, and pleased to say the standards have not dropped. The sea view rooms are a good size and the views are worth paying a little extra for. The food is extremely good and varied, better than any all inclusive we have stayed at before.
The staff are brilliant, most were the same as last year which tells its own story.
The evening entertainment like most all inclusives was a bit disappointing, especially as this is an adults only hotel so you would think that they have the opportunity to offer something a little more lively. For this reason only I have deducted a star, but I am looking forward to visiting again and marking it up.
The cave bar was being refurbished, looked like a major undertaking, so it could be that when completed this will offer something a little more lively for people who did not want to go to bed at 10 pm. Worth baring in mind that there was quite a lot of banging and drilling going on during the day around the cave bar, but I am guessing that will be completed soon.
In summary, I love this hotel, it offers a great break in lovely peaceful surroundings with good food and very good staff, we will definitely be back.",Date of stay: April 2019,Globales Cala Vinas,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Perfect vacation in St Petes,"We stayed at Beachcomber resort in late January to celebrate a milestone birthday and could not have been happier with our choice. From the moment we arrived at reception nothing was too much trouble, the staff were friendly and helpful, as they were throughout the resort.
The location is perfect, step straight out onto the amazing beach and all guests have use of a beach cabana, being part of the resort charge.
The rooms were large, we had a junior suite, and were very clean.
There were 2 bars, the Players Sports bar and the brilliant Jimmy B’s beach bar, which had good live music every afternoon and night, as well as reasonably priced food and drinks. We were only there on week days, but was never too crowded, with a good cross section of people. If you needed a change of scenery there are many excellent bars and restaurants within easy walking distance, Rumfish and Snappers were excellent fish restaurants.
We liked this hotel so much we came back the following week for a few days and it was still perfect!
Look forward to visiting again.",Date of stay: January 2019,The Beachcomber St. Pete Beach | Florida,4,"St. Pete Beach, Florida"
Great experience,"My visit was a surprise for a special birthday and it did not disappoint. From check-in to check-out the staff were exceptionally friendly, small touches such as hand made chocolates in the room and a cake at breakfast were much appreciated. We had 1 hour treatments from Tracy and Enya that were wonderful, and made full use of the spa facilities.
The day finished with a 3 course dinner where although the menu was small the food was very good.
Cisswood House is a handsome quirky place, full of character, and Alex was happy to take time out to show us around the many areas of interest.
All in all a very good experience and we will be back.",Date of stay: January 2019,Cisswood House,4,"Lower Beeding, United Kingdom"
"Good, but could be better","We arrived at the hotel via a short private shuttle which took about 12 minutes and cost about 35 euros for return journey for 4 people, good value I thought. We were greeted by very friendly and professional receptionist and check-in was completed very quickly.
The Junior Suite Rooms were huge with separate lounge area and kitchenette and large balcony.
The hotel is perfectly located adjacent to the beach with a few bars and restaurants very close, and about a 10 minute walk in either direction brings you to a shopping centre or marina.
We were all inclusive and this was we had a few issues. Regarding the food, I am not a fussy eater but I would describe the food as average at best. The breakfasts were good, plenty of selection, but we found the lunch and dinner buffets disappointing. Although there was always something acceptable to eat, many of the dishes were under/over cooked or had been hanging around for a bit. Regarding alcohol, the dining area and lobby bar had self-service for wines, beer and soft drinks which worked well.
The hotel staff were amazing, and must give special mention to Dalila, Michael and Libby, always smiling and happy to serve.
However problems arose after a few days as one of the management, (Honorio?), in the lobby bar starting discussing in Spanish how they had to make more money from their all-inclusive guests and it led to an uncomfortable atmosphere in the bar. The next day the self- service wine function had disappeared in the lobby bar and we were informed that now all drinks had to ordered through the bar staff. Although this may not sound too onerous, in reality the single bar staff now had to make various coffees and hot drinks as well as serve wines and spirits, and this caused delays in getting served. This is a 4 star hotel and I don’t think that actions like this improve the customer experience, if you need to raise more profits then surely raising the price would be a better option than cutting some services. At the very least, I think that some better man-management skills could be employed by senior management when discussing hotel policy in front of guests as some guests can speak Spanish.
To summarise, would I return, yes if the hotel was the same as when we arrived, but unfortunately no if it remains as when we left.",Date of stay: October 2018,Eurostars Las Salinas,4,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Excellent service and great food,"Returned to BP for lunch after having several memorable meals over the last few years. Enjoyed another excellent meal, good food, well presented and still good value, especially for lunchtime menu. £11.95 for 2 courses, braised beef and fillet of Haddock were excellent. I shall definitely be returning in the future.",Date of visit: April 2017,Bistrot Pierre,4,"Leicester, United Kingdom"
Excellent Dining Experience,"We really loved this restaurant and ended up dining here about 5 times in 10 days, and never had the same thing twice.
The setting is superb, overlooking the sea, and everyone receives a warm welcome from Paco.
The menu is mainly fish as you would expect in a fishing harbour resort, but there are plenty of very good meat dishes as well, (chicken and lamb kebabs about 12 euros, leg of lamb cooked in the oven- 18 euros was exceptional).
The fish dishes are very reasonably priced, whole grilled sole about 12 euros, prawn dishes around 8 euros.
House wine 7.50 euros.
Very popular, but never had a problem getting a table, would highly recommend and missing the lovely fish dishes already...",Date of visit: April 2016,Bar Restaurante Eclipse,4,"Caleta De Velez, Spain"
Lovely food at very reasonable proces,"We ate at this restaurant a couple of times and always enjoyed the experience.
It is situated just off the main road, so does not have the sea views of other restaurants, but it makes up for that with the quality of dishes and very good value.
We were blown away by a huge grilled sole at just 9.50 euros, but all of the dishes were very reasonably priced, (entrecote steak 11 euros), and good house wine about 7 euros a bottle.
Fairly small outside dining area, but plenty of tables inside. Would recommend.",Date of visit: April 2016,Restaurante La Fuente,4,"Caleta De Velez, Spain"
Definately worth a visit,"I visited The Scarlett Arms for lunch with a friend after it was recommended. Although there are other well regarded Pub/restaurants in the area, I was looking for something a bit quirky as well as offering good food, as in the past I have found that often the food offered does not in my opinion offer good value.
On entering it felt very warm and friendly. I was greeted at the door by Tracy, the owner/manageress, and after a pint of very acceptable Badger ale, we were taken to our table. The pub is split into about 4 separate areas, all of which were warm and welcoming. There is a varied selection of food, a lot of it Malay, Moroccan, which is a house speciality. There is also a huge portion of fish and chips, (£12.95) and other more usual offerings such as home made burgers and vegetarian dishes. All of the meat is sourced locally. I had Moroccan chicken with Pitta bread and fetta salad and chips, (£10.95), which was excellent.
All in all I would be happy to recommend the restaurant and the atmosphere, and I will definately be returning in the future.",Date of visit: October 2013,Scarlett Arms,4,"Walliswood, United Kingdom"
Same quality hotel,"My third visit this year and I am glad to report the same high quality remains. The location is perfect for me and I must say that I didnt have any poblems with noise from the fairly close bar, but the seagulls in the morning were better than an alarm clock!
The cooked breakfast is superb, especially as it seems the continental beakfast option is creeping into other B & B's.
I stayed again in the Trafalgar room, which although spotlessly clean is on the small size for some people, but that is reflected in the price.
Outside is a small park overrun with squirrels and overlooking all the rides and pier etc.
Would certainly recommend this boutique hotel for any Southend stay.",Date of stay: July 2012,Hamiltons Boutique Hotel,4,"Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom"
exceeded all expectations....,"Booked up this hotel one day before departure, bought on by rubbish weather in UK! Transfer from airport was painless and took about 35 minutes, and we were warmly welcomed with Ouzo and sandwich at reception as was early hours of the morning. Really didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised by everything. The resort is very large and well spread out in 10 accommodation blocks. We were in block 10 which worked well for us as was very close to the beach and beach bar, but away from the noise of the main pool. The rooms are spacious with very large beds and I found them very comfortable. Most of the blocks have 3 floors and I was on second floor with an oblique sea view, (room 1040). I would recommend not being on ground floor as not so private and had some ant problems.
We actually changed our room and the staff, (Maria) could not have been more helpful, nothing is too much trouble. The food on the all-inclusive I thought was excellent, plenty of fresh choices and local produce. Alcohol was served from about 10am to 11.30pm and many an hour was spent in the beach bar overlooking the sea. Slightly annoyingly, all drinks are served in flimsy plastic cups, although I realise that glasses would not be realistic, but I would have thought that something a bit less flimsy should be possible.
Even thought on AI, there are a few exceptional bars on both sides of the resort, just a couple of minutes walk along the beach, and they are really worth a visit. The one to the right of the hotel was amazing, all hammocks and like something from Arabian Nights
On our last day our transfer wasn't until 6pm and the hotel offered us continued use of our room for 40 euros, which for 2 people and use of all the facilities I felt was reasonable. There was an alternative of booking a 30 min slot in a room with a shower later in the day, and there was no charge for this.
I would also say that I have never seen so many children in a resort, mainly aged about 1-5, and while they seemed to have a great time, if you get wound up by noisy children, then this might not be for you. As for me, I found that because the resort is so big, there were plenty of places that were more peaceful than the main swimming pool area with all of the flutes.
Th summarise, I found this to be a well run excellent hotel with brilliant staff, in a fantastic location. Would I return...... you bet!!",Date of stay: June 2012,Labranda Sandy Beach Resort,4,"Corfu, Greece"
Wonderfull place to stay in Southend,"Was lucky enough to stay here for 4 nights and was really impressed. The building has been beautifully restored and retains a real charm. Nothing seems too much trouble for the owners, John and Janet.
There are lots of nice touches, quality towels and fittings and a really comfortable bed, even the coffee in the room was a jar of Gold Blend, not your usual sachets. The room and the hotel was spotlessly clean and it was obvious that great pride was taken in its appearance.
The breakfast was also excellent. The Dining room is absolutely charming, very light with chandeliers etc, with views over the estuary down to the pier.
Locationwise, for me it was excellent, being about 50 yards from the pedestrianised High Street and looks down onto the pier and amusements if that is your thing.
As far as parking goes, there are plenty of metered places outside, but it is possible to park free on road about 10 mins walk away.
I would certainly recommend Hamiltons if you are visiting the area, and I have already re-booked for my next visit to Southend.",Date of stay: March 2012,Hamiltons Boutique Hotel,4,"Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom"
"Very basic, be careful if wanting to check in before 3pm..","This is a very basic hotel but it does have some redeeming features. It is very well situated, behind the hotel is a picturesque stream with a walkway. It is about an 8 minute walk to the centre past beautiful Edinburgh houses and churches. At the hotel there is a small adequate bar and free WiFi.
Now the downside........
Upon arriving at 2pm we were told that it was not possible to check into our room until 3pm. Ok, fair enough, but on enquiring whether we could leave our bags at the hotel until then, we were told there is no facility for this, and there would be an additional charge of £10 to check in early as the room was actually ready. I felt conned, but had to pay up.
I was in a twin room which is very basic, but it is after all a budget hotel. The beds were very narrow and not very comfortable and the blankets would not be sufficient for some people, but apparently rthere were more available from reception.
The water was also cold when trying to take a morning shower, but the hotel was very busy so this may have been unusual.
All in all, it probably represents fair value if you can get the right price, but there are better budget hotels in Edinburgh",Date of stay: February 2012,Britannia Edinburgh Hotel,4,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Lovely food and view - enjoy...,"The approach to Flisvos restaurant from Parga is up a seriously steep set of steps but with the help of a couple of pit stop bars, (all with amazing views over Parga), made it for lunch. There are a couple of other restaurants very close together, but I would definately recommend Flisvos for quality of food, price and fabulous views over Valtos beach. Usual lovely Greek dishes and great fresh fish, ( whole fresh fish approx 11 euros, lamb 9 euros). Carafes of wine 4 euros, ouzo free!
Lovely walk back to Parga, (downhill!) through all of the little tourist shops, was a great day.",Date of visit: May 2011,Flisvos Restaurant,4,"Parga, Greece"
Still a little gem,"Last went to Perivoli last year and loved it. I can honestly say it is even better this year. It is a short flat walk from Parga, (about 7 minutes), through olive trees and passing amazing displays from fireflies. Perivoli is a pretty restaurant, half outside and half with just roof cover. Was a bit concerned about mozzies, but no problems at all. The food is excellent, typical greek dishes along with fresh fish. Lovely starters, (amazing tomato soup and stuffed auborgines etc, about 3 1/2 euros. Main dishes about 8 euros and carafes wine 3.5 euros, the red is really nice.
Trif, (Trifornas but bound to be spelt wrong!) makes you feel really welcome and you feel that you could stay all night if you wanted, (ouzo allowing!). Would definately recommend and look forward to nexr year.",Date of visit: May 2011,Perivoli Restaurant,4,"Parga, Greece"
Perfect location in Parga,"We arrived at Prevesa Airport which is a small but very adequate airport about 70k from Parga. We decided to book a small car from Hertz at the airport as the cost of transfers is quite high. The rental book-in was a doddle, taking only about 10 mins as opposed to a large queue for taxis. Taxi transfers to Parga are 75 euros each way, and the car rental cost was 160 euros plus petrol, (which worked out at 15 euros for the week). We felt that it was worth paying the small extra, and so pleased we did... the main road to Parga is very easy to manoevre and it takes about 50 mins to get to Parga.
Although you do not need a car to get around Parga, we found it perfect for getting to Lichnos beach which was our favourite and otherwise would have been a real uphill walk.
The Dallas Studios are run by Tasos who is always around to help, very friendly indeed. The studios are perfectly located right on the town beach, with beautiful views over the sea from the balcony. They are fairly basic inside, so be aware that everything is in one room, (bed, sitting area, kitchenette etc), with an en-suite bathroom with shower. The studios are very clean with bedding etc changed regularly. The shower is good with plenty of hot water heated by solar power.
From the balcony you can watch people about to struggle up the hill to other apartments!
Basically you have a smaller studio in a perfect location instead of a bigger apartment up the hill. Internet connection can be arranged from Tasos, (free).
Parga itself is beautiful, with a real charm. The Greek people are warm and friendly and it hasnt dumbed-down to tourism. There are loads of bars and tavernas along the front and in the town itself. The food is really good and very reasonable in price, (you will pay more for a sea view). 25-30euros with wine for 2 people is about average.
Special mention to Perivoli, Arkoudas and Bacchos tavernas as they rate a special mention.
The main beach can get a bit crowded, (8euros for 2 sunbeds and umbrella), but we liked Lichnos beach, beautiful, much quieter and with a few tavernas right on the beach, (also only 6euros for beds).
All in all, a wonderful holiday and would definately go back.
Shame that the transfers are a bit expensive, you would have thought that it would have been possible for a few of the apartment owners to arrange a cheaper minibus option, but maybe in the future.",Date of stay: May 2010,Dallas Studios,4,"Parga, Greece"
