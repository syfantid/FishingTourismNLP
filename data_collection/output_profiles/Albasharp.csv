Not value for money....,"Positive points:

Interesting to see real fishermen/woman at work and see net fishing techniques
Hosts very friendly but only the lady speaks English so hard to communicate and ask questions of other hosts
Boat was very clean and organised
All kinds of fish are caught including: flying fish, lobster, calamari, crabs, barracuda, sea bass, scorpion fish and many more!

Negative points:

You board boat early at 08.00 and you are greeted to a jug of hot water and instant coffee with dried breadsticks and very dry biscuits- I think decent coffee and cake is more appropriate to the price paid.
A bit boring watching and helping to bring the fish in as it takes time to release from nets could be made more interesting by imparting knowledge of the fish etc
I saw photos on TripAdvisor of calamari and lobster with pasta served for lunch which looked delicious and encouraged me to book but reality is that they choose the fish you get to eat which in our case was a small offering for the 12-people in the boat and no sign of the calamari or various other fish which were caught. Seemed like they were set aside to sell in the restaurants and we just got a meagre portion. The two lobsters we did catch were cooked and split in four and looked delicious but they decided to pull straws for who got them and would have been much fairer to give each of the four families onboard one half each. We didn’t even get to pull a straw never mind taste it!
No wine was served in the boat and we were told they had finished it as they produce their own and it was the end of the season so there was non left-not acceptable if you are selling it as part of your excursion, particularly if you don’t drink beer? It should have been replaced by the local robola wine from one of the Kefalonian wineries and explained that they had run out but it was a good local substitute.
When eating and deboning fresh fish one needs a knife. You are given only a fork so hot fish straight off the grill and no knife is not easy to eat!
Drinks are VERY limited and hidden away somewhere so that you need to ask for them. They should have done a briefing at the start of the day to explain where drinks were so that people felt comfortable and at ease in drinking what they wanted. I drank a glass of lemonade and a water all day long.
You are taken to a few bays but there isn’t really anything to do other than swim and they make it quite clear when it’s time to prepare lunch that they want you off the boat til it’s ready. It would be a good idea to invest in some paddle boards and flippers so that you can go off and explore in the caves when you’re kicked off the boat.

All in all I left feeling VERY ripped off and not really able to say anything about it as it would ruin our day...hence I hope they read this and use it constructively to enhance what they are currently offering. I would value that experience at a maximum of €40 for what we experienced and sadly would never recommend it to anyone. For a couple it cost €150 and I feel that is taking the mikey really.",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,3,"Cephalonia, Greece"
A good little find!,"We went to this beautiful restaurant a couple of weeks ago for a lazy Sunday lunch. We were greeted by the owner who was charming and very attentive and he took us through the menu explaining the provenance of every ingredient. .which is pretty impressive! It's easy to see his passion for cooking and knowledge for sourcing out the very best ingredients Italy has to offer. The bread was made in the restaurant with original antique grains,(not the mass produced for mass consumption treated and genetically modified grain) obviously organic and by using natural yeast. The pasta is made here too from the same grain and had a lovely nutty taste to it. We ate wild board pappardelle which was delicious. We both chose the grass fed locally sourced steak fillet which had a wonderful flavour and was cooked to perfection. All of this washed down with a wonderful red wine from lazio made for a very enjoyable afternoon. The owner/chefs passion coupled with the excellent standard of food and customer service has put this restaurant on our list of favourites in the area. Thank you for a wonderful lunch...we'll be back soon!",Date of visit: November 2018,La Cantina,3,"Formello, Italy"
