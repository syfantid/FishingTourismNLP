Fantastic day out!,"Our family spent a fantastic day with Cpt. Giorgos last week. My children (aged 15 and 13) had the most amazing time learning about the fishing and then diving in from the boat in some of the most beautiful spots on the island. Nothing was too much trouble and the communication throughout was excellent. Cpt. Giorgos even suggested we wait a day before going on the trip as the sea conditions would be calmer for the family. Everything worked perfectly. You can park your car next to the ship, coffee and pastries waiting as you leave the harbour and the fresh fish lunch was delicious. I would also recommend taking a map and a pen as Cpt. Giorgios will also tell you about all the best beaches, tavernas and things to do on the island. It was like having your very own tour guide! I would highly recommend this trip and hope to return again one day!",Date of experience: August 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Excellent transfer from Costa Navarino to Kalamata Airport,Fantastic transfer from Dionisis. Car was immaculate and arrived in plenty of time for schedule pick up. Dionisis was exceptionally helpful and provided us with lots of detail about the area on our way to the airport. Would not hesitate to recommend and will definitely use again if we return to the area. Thank you!,Date of experience: September 2019,We Transfer You,5,"Kalamata, Greece"
