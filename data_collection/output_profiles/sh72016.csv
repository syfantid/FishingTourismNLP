Lovely holiday made perfect by the host.,"Perfect holiday. Location was quiet, but restaurants and supermarkets were in easy walking distance, sea was in sniffing distance. The villa was very clean and well maintained. The icing on the cake was the host. Irini went out of her way to make sure our family holiday was perfect.
Perfect holiday for myself, husband and two daughters.",Date of stay: August 2020,Villa Coral for 4/6 persons with 2 bedrooms and private swimming pool,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Spalite Hotel,"Stayed for 7 nights over two weeks. Trish is a genuine, friendly and accommodating host.
The rooms stayed in were clean and tidy. Breakfast was cooked to order and was tasty and filling. The hotel provides excellent value for money and is located a stone throw from the quays.
Would not hesitate to book again.",Date of stay: July 2019,Spalite Hotel,5,"Gloucester, United Kingdom"
Can not fault,"My daughter and I qualified in the UK earlier this year and are both very nervous divers. I can not praise Chris and Maria enough. Yes we saw colourful fish, yes the water was lovely and warm, but the most important element of our dives is that we both felt safe. Chris and Maria went out of their way to empower and reassure us with out any element of trivialisation.

We can not rated them highly enough.",Date of experience: August 2018,Apollo Dive Center,5,"Corfu, Greece"
Amazing service and food,"Ate here for four nights, tried other eateries in Nissaki but this was by far the best. The host went out of her way to make sure my fussy daughters had a good meal. The service was quick and non-intrusive. The meals were very reasonably priced, comparable if not cheaper that other venues we ate at.",Date of visit: September 2018,Taverna dora nisaki,5,"Corfu, Greece"
"Amazing day, amazing food. Best meal of the holiday.","My husband, two daughters and I recently had the pleasure of this experience.
Firstly the food is amazing, even though we ate out at different restaurants every night of our holiday this was easily the best meal. Antonia is an amazing cook who goes out of her way to make sure everyone is looked after and happy.
Secondly the sea was so blue, the scenery so beautiful, the day out so calm and peaceful.
Finally this it is so interesting to see how the fish is caught.
This is a must do!",Date of experience: August 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Something different, well worth a visit","My 7 year daughter was really scared of bees, I say was, because thanks to this fabulous visit and the hospitality of Eleni and Thanassis she is now cured. As another review has mentioned the 2 hours flew, although you do not feel rushed. My husband, 2 daughters and myself learned so much, it was a highlight of our holiday.",Date of experience: August 2017,Dias Beekeeping,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely experience.,"None of my family have ridden before but a lovely experience for myself, husband and two young daughters. A lot of care and time was spent ensuring our safety before we started the trek.",Date of experience: June 2016,Kefalonia's Horse Riding Stable,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
