Fantastic day out,We had a wonderful day out with Dimitris and Efi. They were so kind and accommodating to us and our 6 month old baby. We were made to feel very welcome and nothing was too much trouble. The lunch of our freshly caught fish catch was absolutely delicious and the views of the coastline from the boat were beautiful. All in all it was a relaxing day out which we would highly recommend.,Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Outstanding Overnight Safari,"My two friends and I went on an overnight tour with Paul and we had an incredible time. He has so much knowledge and taught us loads about the wildlife, the landscapes and the areas we travelled through. It really made the journey part of the experience. We had many trip highlights, but the beautiful Hluhluwe reserve was definitely the best. We were lucky enough to see elephants charging at a pair of lions up close, as well as a very fortunate zebra who just escaped the clutches of another lion.

I have no idea how Paul can sense something big is about to happen, he has an uncanny ability to get you in the right place at just the right time! His energy and enthusiasm is boundless and we loved our night walk to view glow in the dark scorpions just as much as seeing the big wildlife. Highly recommended.",Date of experience: March 2018,Mzansi Safari Africa,5,"Durban, South Africa"
