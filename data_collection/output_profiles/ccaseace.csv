Super nice beach,"The beach is very beautiful and calm, one just has to be aware of the tar which comes out of natural tar-wells, wetshoes are recommended becausec it is a stone beach. The Keeper of the beach, who also rents sun umbrellas and sunbeds, is always on guard and informs you when it is better to watch for the tar on the water or steps in when some sailors or motoboats come to close ashore. Once a day a nice old man visits the beach to sell drinks and incredible fresh fruit salad. Thx to the two guys for some perfect days on your beach.",Date of experience: July 2018,Marathias Beach,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Five Points are not even enough for a day to remember all your life!,"If you want to experience some vey special hours with, friendly, heartwarming and nice people then you definitely need to do a trip with the Poseidon.
Our day started in the port of Lixouri where the Poseidon and her captain Gerasimos and his companion and crewman panos where awaiting our arrival. After a friendly welcome they served breakfast with ""kefalonian"" feta cheese, which is one of the most tasty pieces of cheese we have ever tried, fresh tomatoes from the region, a wonderful olive oil, handmade bakery, cookies and even original greek coffee.
While we were closing the meal, the captain already set course to the location where he has casted out his fishing-net early in the morning.
The net was reeled quickly and a respectable catch was revealed, now it was time to remove the fishes from the net, and if you want to, you can also participate and give them a hand. But this is not an easy thing, which I experienced when I was trying to get our designated food out of the nets hooks. Fortunately and to my advantage the captain Gerasimos was very patient and gave me advice more than once.
Now we had some time to enjoy a swim in the ionian sea and a bath in the sun, so the Poseidon casted anchor in a beautiful cove, where we were brought ashore in a small boat by panos. As true professionals and predictive Fishermen they also brought a sun umbrella, an air mattress a pair of flippers and diving goggles to experience the underwater world neat the surface.
While we were enjoying our visit to this lonesome beach our two friends on the boat where already preparing lunch, which was served some time later while the Poseidon was lying in calm waters south of the island. They served their traditional fish soup, ""Kakavia'"" which has an overwhelming taste and freshness, a beautiful fried fish and a tasty glas of white wine. Gerasimos proofed that he was not only an experienced fisherman and mariner but also an impressive cook. During our time on this beautiful boat we had lots of time to talk to Gerasimos and Panos and to share memories, experiences and funny moments. The only bad thing of which we can report is the fact we had to leave the boat in the afternoon and to say good bye!
Thank you Gerasimos and Panos, for this incredible day and for giving us an understanding of your life near and on the ionian sea. Im sure we will see us again!",Date of experience: June 2019,Poseidon Fishing Tourism Kefalonia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
