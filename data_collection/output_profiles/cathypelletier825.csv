great vibe!,I had the pan seared tuna. It was wonderful and artistically presented over quinoa & edamame. The service was stellar and my husband loved the steak. The prices were average and the restaurant was adorable. Highly recommend!,Date of visit: August 2018,Kome,4,Curaçao
great outdoor space,"Enjoy dinner in an adorable outdoor garden. Red snapper was good, but the filet mignon w/ peppercorn sauce was outstanding. Excellent service with a menu in 3 languages. Great little spot!",Date of visit: August 2018,Rozendaels Original Cuisine,4,Curaçao
Breathtaking view!,Mother nature stole the show with a full moon and crashing waves just feet from the restaurant. The view is just unbelievable. We only had a pizza and a calzone which were fun. The service was stellar. Jhonny was completely attentive and welcoming. Great experience.,Date of visit: August 2018,Dal Toro,4,Curaçao
Perfect!,"Our driver/tour guide, Appolstolis spoke excellent English, was friendly and very knowledgeable. He promptly picked us up at our hotel and drove us to the main sights in Greece. He even walked with us through a park to see the changing of the guard in front of Parliament. He took us to a great little shopping/lunch area in Plaka. Excellent tour, the best tour guide and driver! I highly recommend this tour.",Date of experience: July 2018,Athens Half-Day Sightseeing Self-Guided Tour,4,"Athens, Greece"
Best tour in Greece!,"I cannot say enough about our Captain Anthi and her crew! We had more fun on this tour than any other on our holiday. The experience was so authentic and enlightening. We ate, swam, fished and felt part of a family with the crew by the end of the tour. Don't miss this tour!",Date of experience: July 2018,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
