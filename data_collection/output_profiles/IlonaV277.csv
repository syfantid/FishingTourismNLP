The best holiday ever ❤️,"This place in not only about its location and facilities. It’s also about the host! We were warmly welcomed met and explained everything as well as cherished with a homemade cake and olive oil.
The room was facing the sea and the garden. Very close to the beach, tavernas, shops , vineyard, bus stop and whatever you need on your holiday. The area itself is quiet , at the same time you will find what you need: a place to eat, shops, busstop are at your hand. Highly recommend.",Date of stay: October 2019,"Kefalonia, Lourdata: studios near Lourdas beach, swimming pool, sea view",5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
