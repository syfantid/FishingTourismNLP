Such a lovely visit,"Great afternoon tea, a lovely walk (wish it had been a little bit longer) stunning views. Something a bit different I highly recommend!",Date of experience: July 2020,Charnwood Forest Alpacas,4,"Boundary, United Kingdom"
What a let down,"So I will start with the positives as there are a few. Location is an absolute dream so close to the beach, shops and restaurants. The pool area is wonderful- a pleasent few pools, plenty of sunlougers and a great atmosphere. We only went bed and breakfast and it was really nice; great variety.

However all of those were overshadowed by a considerable leak in our room from the ceiling. It started on our 3rd day. DRIP DRIP DRIP. It was about 2am. Rang reception who said there was nothing they could do until the morning- fair enough (1 night of disturbed sleep) they said they would call us back first thing in thr morning- they didn't. It took 3 phone calls the following day to get the engineer out to fix it- he heroically arrived with masking tape. Shockingly the following morning we were awoken by DRIP DRIP DRIP the leak came back. We called 2 more times for the engineet to come out and he arrived with some thicker tape- hallelujah. That night we arrived back from a lovely evening to a huge puddle on the floot DRIP DRIP DRIP the leak had started again. We rang reception who said that there was nothing they could do until the morning. We asked if we could move rooms as it was getting a tad annoying. They said no. (2nd night of broken sleep.) That morning someone came out to fix the leak while we were out at the pool. But later in the afternoon when we returned you guessed it DRIP DRIP DRIP tgabk heavens two engineers came with the thickest masking tape I had ever seen to fix it and then that night (our last night)we came back to discover DRIP DRIP DRIP. Another huge puddle in the middle of the floor and bedding soaked at thr bottom. We rang again- at this point they offered us a different room 8 hourse before we were leaving for the airport- by this point we'd had enough and said forget it. (3rd night of broken sleep.) So paying for 7 nights and we didn't really sleep for 3 of them

Also on top of this the cleaning wasn't really up to scratch and we had a plant growing from behind our bed- which after reporting to reception they simply pulled out the visible bit and allowed it to continuing growing into our room.

Beware if you are looking gor a 4* hotel this isn't up to the expected standard. There are many great features and if you don't have any problems (eg a drip) you may have a pleasent enough time. But my friend and i had no apology and at time the staff at reception were rude and dismissive like we were an inconvenience and they were fed up of us calling- trust me so were we!",Date of stay: August 2018,"MSH Mallorca Senses Hotel, Palmanova (Adults Only)",4,"Majorca, Spain"

Not a very tasty dish,Had dinner here during our holiday and I wouldn't go back. I love carbonara but what i was served here was the most tasteless dish ever! The pizzas are a much safer bet.,Date of visit: August 2018,Abracadabra Pizza Restaurant,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Oh wow!!!,I was a little sceptical eating a curry abroad but I am sure glad I gave it a try. It was delicious- one of the best curries i had ever eaten. Very polite and attentive staff. I highly reccommend eating here.,Date of visit: August 2018,Saffron Desi,4,"Majorca, Spain"
Amazing inflatables,Today we went to Tattershall Lakes and the inflatables were incredible. Such good value. We also stopped at the Spitfire Bar which was a great place for drinks. There seemed to be ao much to do there and my friends and I will be booking a short break there in the neat future we were so impressed with the park and the facilities.,Date of stay: September 2017,Tattershall Lakes Country Park,4,"Tattershall, United Kingdom"
Wonderful hotel,The hotel Semiramis is set in a peaceful location yet only a 2 min walk from the beach and a 10 min walk from plenty of restaurants. Beautiful newly refurbished rooms- clean and fresh. The only downside is a tiny shower. The pool is also quite small but as its 2 mins from the beach who cares! Overall an excellent place and i would highly reccommend.,Date of stay: August 2017,Semiramis City Hotel,4,"Rhodes, Greece"

Wow what an experience,Just a fantastic afternoon. Great fishing with plenty of support for those who are unsure. A lovely bit of snorkelling (equipment provided) and gorgeous freshly cooked fish all combines for an incredible holiday experience. If you are visiting Rhodes this is a must!,Date of experience: August 2017,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
An interesting experience,Fun and educational this is a great way to spend a bit of time and a wonderful way to find out about history while still engaging people of all ages.,Date of experience: August 2017,Throne of Helios,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Karaoke and laughs galore,A tiny place filled with laughs. Incredible staff yet sometimes questionable karaoke. This place has a home away from home feel. We just loved spending time here!,Date of visit: August 2017,Martini Bar,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Yummy,Great food in fact incredible food. Great staff and reasonable prices. Would highly recommend. A lovely atmosphere.,Date of visit: August 2017,Yamas,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Wow cocktails to die for,This place offers the best cocktails i have ever tried. Peach collins and blue lagoon is a must! The staff are friendly and there is a buzzing atmosphere. The guy at the front of house is a little pushy (to say the least) but you will thank him for tempting you in as these cocktails really are to die for.,Date of visit: August 2017,Local Bar Restaurant,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
A great trip to a new and fresh caravan site,"I attended this site one month after opening and was impressed with the experience. The caravan we stayed in was a luxury caravan and it certainly did deliver luxury. With a well equipped kitchen, comfortable lounge and wonderful hot tub and decking areas. The twin room were very small and the beds tiny- but something which can be expected of a caravan. The description of the accommodation was slightly questionable, as they described the double room as having an en suite which it didn't. We did have a slight issue with the smell due to the location of the caravan but our complaint was dealt with quickly and reasonably. The bar/restaurant was lovely on site and reasonably priced. The leisure facilities were also excellent great pool, spa and lots for kids to do. The only thing that let the site down was the noise and smell of the virador pumping sewage and the price to get new towels mid week- Â£10 for a bath sheet and hand towel is a ridiculous amount of money to pay- you should be provided with fresh towels when staying for 5 days.",Date of stay: August 2014,Piran Meadows Resort,4,"White Cross, United Kingdom"
