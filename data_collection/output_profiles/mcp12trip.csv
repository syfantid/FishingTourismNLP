Authentic Aegean Fishing trip.,"Exceeded all expectations despite glowing reviews! Must, must do. Captain Anthi puts you on the bite. And her crew is competent and friendly. Just as all the reviews have stated earlier. That would be enough for a great day fishing. But these folks go way beyond. Anthi was constantly teaching and educating our family. She taught the adults and teens technique, species, history, and conservation. She protects the sea and has an incredible passion to teach others to do the same. We've fished fresh and salt around the world. The Giorgaros tour is at the top of our list!",Date of experience: July 2019,Giorgaros fishing tours Santorini,5,"Santorini, Greece"
