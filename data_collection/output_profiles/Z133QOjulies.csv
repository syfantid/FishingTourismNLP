Fantastic boat trip,"Had a fantastic day today on this boat trip! Amazing scenery, amazing fresh caught and cooked seafood and wonderful hosts who take very good care of us and the other guests. Our 2 boys loved it, especially swimming in the beautiful clear water. Would highly recommend this trip if visiting Kefalonia.",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
