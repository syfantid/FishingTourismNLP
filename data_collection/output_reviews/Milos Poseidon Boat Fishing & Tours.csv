It is absolutely one of the best isle in Greece. The cruise is an all day one starting from Pollonia Beach in the morning. We had a stop for a bath at least of 30 minutes in Kato Mersini Beach, Galazia Nera Beach (Blue Bay), another beach in the south coast where we had lunch and finally in another beach in the north coast of Poliegos. He made us to visit some caves along the path too. The captain sailed along the coast trying to make us to see all wonderful water along the coast: he is very expert because he is a fisherman in Milos during the wintertime. We were luckly because the wind, waves, sea and weather so we succedeed to go around completely in Poliegos. We visited also Epano Mersini Beach (Mersine Beach) and Ammoura Beach where is the lighthouse.  We had a very long lunch stop where he offered a delicious lunch composed of salads and pasta with fish. It's offering you all drinks for free anytime you would like, not only during the lunch: juices, beer, coke, water and so on.   The captain is VERY kind and funny, the boat is small so there are few tourists on board so the enviroment is very familiar. You can freely ask everything you need at the captain and he'll make the best to satisfy! That money spent with the cruise are the BEST spent of your holiday there! ;) I advice to sail with him because you will not be able to forget easily this ""familiar-cruise"" because Poliegos and the captain Andreas!…"
