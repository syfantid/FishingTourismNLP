Comfort food- the way Yia Yia would make it.,"Dining in Santorini typically goes like this: Great view=average/bad food;
No view=great food. We were reluctant to eat here, only because the place looked a little dark and uninviting from a distance. Don't let that fool you.The food here is better than the white table cloth places where we dined. Everything here is great! The food, the staff, the prices. The service is quick and friendly. The waiter was so happy that I ordered in Greek, he smiled a big smile and shook my hand. If you order the Moussaka, make sure you're hungry; the serving is large enough for two.",Date of visit: September 2017,Posidonia Greek Tavern,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Great experience!,"Anthi and her crew gave us a great fishing and dining experience on our vacation! First, shuttle service to and from your hotel; all the gear for fishing,snorkeling, and swimming (towels) is provided; the fresh catch of the day is cooked right on the boat (grilled or fried), with Greek salad, ouzo, wine, beer and soda included in the cost. The meal was so good, I couldn't stop eating the fish!
You can help haul in the catch, and clear the nets, or just kick back and relax. I also want to mention that my girlfriend cannot eat gluten, so Anthi took great care to keep the fried fish (and orzo) separate from the gluten free food. We loved our time out on the Agean! Thank you.",Date of experience: September 2017,Giorgaros fishing tours Santorini,5,"Santorini, Greece"
