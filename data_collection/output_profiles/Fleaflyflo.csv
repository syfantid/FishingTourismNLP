Lovely meal,"Fabulous meal had here last week, lovely welcoming service and great food. Already looking forward to returning!",Date of visit: July 2020,Katana Japanese (Teppanyaki & sushi) cuisine,4,"Spalding, United Kingdom"
Beautiful holiday ❤️,"We have just spent 11 nights at the Sotiris Studios and have enjoyed one of the best holidays in Greece we’ve ever had. From the most welcoming of owners and staff to the gorgeous (if huge!!) meals, cooked fresh each day to the spotlessly clean gardens and pools there really isn’t anything we’d change here. The beach is a short walk away and whilst in a quiet area it had all we needed. An easy bus trip into Argostoli means you can dip into a busy town when you feel the need and if you take the 9oc bus you can watch the turtles swimming in the bay, simply amazing to watch.
We have never returned to a holiday spot before but are struggling to find a reason not to rebook next year, we hope to be back soon! Thank you for a fab break, Andy Lisa and Emma Agar",Date of stay: August 2018,Sotiris Studios,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely beach,"A lovely beach with plenty of sun beds and umbrellas even at the peak of the school holidays. Waiter service is available from each of the sets of sun beds and a cafe at one end of the beach which served nice quality sandwiches, salads and drinks. Quite good snorkelling and although the beach shelves quite quickly there are large sandbanks you can easily swim to if you want some space to yourselves. There are hoses/showers to rinse your sand off when you leave the beach and the only small downside would be a steep slope down/up from the beach to the roadside but anyone able bodied will easily cope. We will happily return",Date of experience: August 2018,Ammes Beach,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best day of our holiday!,"Spending a holiday in Svoronata we looked into the boat trip here and emailed to pre-book-it was the best decision of our holiday! The most welcoming of hosts, superb company and gorgeous food together with swimming off the boat made this an idyllic day. This trip was worth every penny and if we’d had time we would have gone again the next day. During our trip our hosts were disappointed by the size of the day’s catch and seemed genuinely upset that they would be letting us down. Nothing could be further from the truth, the food cooked by Antonia and wine were plentiful and delicious. I cannot recommend this trip more highly, thank you all for a truly memorable day Lisa, Andy and Emma",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely hotel,A really good hotel for a few nights in Paris. It's situated close to the Gare de Lyon and was around 20 mins walk to Notre Dame. We were blessed with really good weather so instead of walking everywhere as usual we invested in Batobus tickets for both days and used them to hop on and off of-money well spent! We chose not to have breakfast in the hote but all that we saw looked good. The rooms although not huge were clean and fine for all our needs. The only small gripe was that the air conditioning wasn't very good and with 30 degree heat we struggled to sleep at night. The staff were really helpful and welcoming and the car parking on site was a real bonus. I'd happily stay here again :),Date of stay: May 2017,Ibis Paris Gare de Lyon Ledru Rollin 12eme,4,"Paris, France"
Lovely museum,"Fab museum, we visited later in the afternoon so no queues and good value as our teens did not need to pay to enter. Plenty of time and space to see some amazing and very famous work without the usual stuffy feel of a museum.",Date of experience: May 2017,Musée d'Orsay,4,"Paris, France"
My favourite!,By far my favourite part of a trip to Paris. Luckily for us there were few hawkers trying to relieve us of cash this visit and the Basilica was fairly quiet. Last visit we all climbed to the top but be warned that as well as plenty of steps the climb is up a steep circular staircase which isn't for the faint hearted! If you do venture up the views are wonderful though,Date of experience: May 2017,Basilique du Sacre-Coeur de Montmartre,4,"Paris, France"
lovely to wander round,"We wandered round Monmartre after our visit to the Sacre-Coeur and it's a lovely spot to see some of the artists painting or just to get a coffee and watch the world go by. Fairly ""touristy"" but still a nice way to pass some time",Date of experience: May 2017,Montmartre,4,"Paris, France"
Easy way to get about,"Excellent value for us, with the 30 degree heat we were happy to hop on and off the Batobus to save our legs and avoid overheating! We paid for 2 day passes for us and our teens but be aware that you will need passports to prove childrens ages, we didn't have ours with us so paid full price purely because we didn't want to waste time going back to get them. Both the ticket sales staff and staff on board spoke really good english and were happy to help.",Date of experience: May 2017,Batobus,4,"Paris, France"
Sunday lunch,"Visited Bentleys today and enjoyed a gorgeous roast. Everything cooked beautifully-no soggy veggies and plenty of choice. Happy, welcoming staff who looked after us well even though the restaurant was quite busy. Looking forward to visiting again, really good value for money.",Date of visit: November 2015,Bentleys Bar and Grill,4,"Spalding, United Kingdom"
fantastic location,"Stayed here for our first trip to Rome and would happily return tomorrow! The hotel is situated in the main shopping street with plenty of restaurants offering tasty, reasonably priced food. We booked a terrace room and although compact it had everything we needed. The sun terrace was a lovely to sit in the morning or rest your feet after a day walking round the beautiful sights. One tip (not hotel based) would be COMFORTABLE shoes-the cobbled streets take their toll!! Although the hotel is on a busy street the room was quiet enough at night to sleep with only the shutters closed, wonderful on a warm night. Breakfast was plentiful and topped up frequently by helpful waiting staff, a good continental selection with an option to purchase hot food if you wanted to.The staff throughout the hotel were very welcoming and the reception staff were helpful and accommodating. Rome is a stunning city and when we return again the Hotal Regno will be our obvious choice, thank you for a wonderful few days!!",Date of stay: September 2015,Hotel Regno,4,"Rome, Italy"
Perfect for a few days enjoying Paris,Having recently returned from a short stay here I would happily return tomorrow! The room was spotless and although not huge it was certainly large enough for our needs. It was quiet and comfortable-exactly what you need after a long day tourist trekking and the swimming pool was lovely to relax and revive in. The hotel's location was perfect for rail travel and there are plenty of restaurants close by which open late. Having stayed once before with the Novotel group I will happily make them my first choice in other cities.,Date of stay: May 2015,Novotel Paris Gare de Lyon,4,"Paris, France"
Another good stay at Disney,"A lovely week spent at the Cheyenne, our 5th visit to Eurodisney since it opened. The rooms are basic and clean and are a perfect base for a Disney break. Our children are older (12 and 15) and there was enough space for all us. Although busy, breakfast was always well stocked with the basic continental fare and we always found a table with ease. This may be due to us eating later (at 9am til 10am). The early park hours aren't as useful for us as the major rides don't open any sooner so we made the most of the park being open until 11, with the rides quietening from 9ish. We chose not to use the hotel bar, preferring to stay in the park or the village. All in all a really good holiday :o)",Date of stay: May 2015,Disney's Hotel Cheyenne,4,"Marne-la-Vallee, France"
Fantastic views,"Long queues but well worth the wait!! If you can, pre book your tickets-at peak times you're looking at up to 3 hours queueing like we did. Luckily we were in the May sunshine and it passed quite quickly. Fantastic views from each stage and well worth the time and cost",Date of experience: May 2015,Eiffel Tower,4,"Paris, France"
Best in town!,"Lovely restaurant, with superb food and friendly welcoming staff. Indus are happy to support the town with fund raising evenings and every visit is as lovely as the last. Would thoroughly recommend!",Date of visit: April 2014,Indus,4,"Spalding, United Kingdom"
