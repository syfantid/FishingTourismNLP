Great place to shop for jewelry for gifts,They have a beautiful selection of jewelry and price is super reasonable. I bought a bunch of bracelets as gifts.,Date of experience: August 2019,To Komboloi Tou Psiri,4,"Athens, Greece"
Fava hummus!,"It was our last night in Athens and yes, we are upset we discovered this too late. The service was amazing. Location is close to our hotel. Food was great. While we have had the Greek salad, octopus, etc that's in typical Greek restaurants. All were very good at Bandiera by the way. What blew our mind was the Fava hummus!!! So good! The hospitality was great as well. To end our meal, we had free dessert along with an after dinner drink.",Date of visit: August 2019,Bandiera,4,"Athens, Greece"
Free drinks and fresh lunch prepared for you,"One of the highlights of our trip. Where else can you go fishing and the captain prepares your catch for your while you swim? The lunch setup is super cute where they have your cooked fish, salad, and a side of bread for you all prepared for you at the ""table"" so when you hop back on the boat after your swim, all you do is eat. With the food scraps you throw them into the water and a bunch of fish will fight over it. It was fun watching that. The fishing we caught that day were all very tiny though, so don't expect any big catch?

I'd def. recommend this fun half day trip with Makarounas if you are sick of lounging at the beach.",Date of experience: August 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Good budget stay,"We were here for one night for a wedding and it was a good budget stay. Showers are big, rooms are clean. The only problem is we were woken up by some pool aerobic exercise class with the loud music around 10AM. Else checkin and checkout was super easy.",Date of stay: August 2019,Sunday Hotel,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Amazing staff and nice room,Every staff member are super friendly and accommodating. The resort itself is quiet and relaxing. The rooms are spacious and clean. Especially the showers are bigger than the typical Greece apartment showers. Shower water pressure is good. I enjoyed their breakfast every morning. It was central to a lot of the beaches/restaurants we were visiting with our group of friends.,Date of stay: August 2019,Eco Beach and Magic Garden Hotel,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Better than any Indian food in NYC,"We were fortunate that we stayed at Marigot Bay Resort so Masala Bay was a walk away from us. We ate there 3 nights out of the 4 nights we were there. It is excellent Indian food! We had the goat, lamb, chicken Korma, different naans, we tried new things every night and everything was just delicious! The one night we didn't eat there, I felt like we cheated on them. We have a pretty good selection living in NYC but Masala Bay is absolutely up there!

Being the #1 restaurant on St. Lucia, it wasn't stuffy or expensive. Just a good casual dining experience with great service and great food.",Date of visit: February 2019,Masala Bay,4,St. Lucia
A bit far from airport and other attractions but great service,"It's our first time in St. Lucia and we had the pleasure to get a penthouse suite. I am glad I booked this resort because other places we looked at in Soufriere had the 3 wall open environment concept, which I believe doesn't have AC and doesn't have 4 enclosed walls. At Marigot Bay, it was all enclosed, we had AC and had quiet night sleep.

Location - The location is a bit far from airport and we made a mistake of renting a car. The roads are very windy and there are a lot of pin hair turns. It is also a bit far from Soufriere where there are some great snorkeling spots and of course the Pitons. However, you do get a great view of the bay and you can admire all the MEGA yachts docked there.

Service - Top notch 5 star service all around as other reviews have stated.

Food - The resort itself doesn't have best food and what I'm most disappointed with the resort and surrounding restaurants on the bay area (Doolittle's, Hassy's, Chateau Mygo) didn't serve Salt Fish which is their national dish. On my last day, I discovered the mini grocery store by Hurricane Hole did serve a salt fish sandwich which I was able to finally try. The best restaurant around the area without taking a land taxi was Masala Bay. It's the # 1 restaurant on the island and we are lucky enough to be located near it and we had dinner there 3 times out of our 4 night stay.

Activities - When we are there, if you want to book water tours/activities use Saltwater tour (I think that's the name), by the dock. We had great sunset cruise with Carnival Sailing. Great staff, very informative and very organized. We also did a snorkel trip booked with Satlwater the next day. It's a different boat, but very friendly staff and visited 2 snorkel sites. If you want land activities like Piton or sulfur springs, etc, book with your assistant.",Date of stay: February 2019,Marigot Bay Resort and Marina,4,St. Lucia
Highlight of our Chiang Mai Trip. This is a must do!,"10 years ago we got married in Thailand and visited ENP for a day trip. 10 years later we went back and this time we did the overnight stay. I can not stress what an amazing experience it is!! Do no look anywhere else for an up close elephant experience. This is the place to go, observe, get educated and you will be glad you made a visit.",Date of experience: November 2018,Elephant Nature Park,4,"Chiang Mai, Thailand"
Excellent wifi connection,"We stayed in the best room which has direct pool access. Room 333. The room and hotel is clean with beautiful detailed decor. Service and staff are no less than great as expected in Thailand.

What really surprised us the awesome wifi connection. We face-timed with family back in the states and we had no problem with the connection at all.

Breakfast was delicious. It was one of our better meals in Chiang Mai. The only thing we didn't know about the hotel is it's also an alcohol free place.

The location is very convenient to the night bazaar and the old city. The street is on a quieter street but safe so you don't feel like you are in the middle of the city. No city noise.",Date of stay: November 2018,Away Chiang Mai Thapae Resort – A Vegan Retreat,4,"Chiang Mai, Thailand"
3rd time in Bermuda and this is one of the best restaurants we've been to,"Been to Bermuda 3 times. Been to Marcus, 1609 Bar, Bouchee, Port O Call, Gulfstream etc…This is definitely one of the top if not the top restaurants we have been to for food and service. We were surprised to see spaghetti carbonara on the menu on the appetizer section so we got it and split it amongst the 4 of us. It was surprisingly good. I also ordered the rockfish entre and it was fantastic!",Date of visit: August 2018,"Henry VIII Restaurant, Sushi Bar and Pub",4,Bermuda
Silkiest sand ever!!!,"I am a sand snob because I have sensitive feet. This beach has the best and silkiest sand I’ve ever seen in the Caribbean. I’m comparing it to Turks and Caicos, St. Martin, St. Barths, etc. Walking on Elbow beach is like walking on a cloud. There is a public beach area but we dined in the Elbow Beach Resort and was able to access the beach from there. The water here isn’t as calm as other beaches but man, the sand!",Date of experience: August 2018,Elbow Beach,4,Bermuda
"Poor to No Service, Bad Food, No Premium Drinks","This is our 4th visit to TCI and we decided to try Alexandra’s all-inclusive this time. If you made your reservations already, you aren’t completely screwed. I’ll tell you how to make the best of it. But first the bad. Out of all 3 sister resorts we visited, Alexandra which is where we stayed was the worst.

Drinks – While it was advertised that you get premium drinks in your all-inclusive, anytime we asked for better liquor they said they are out. We went during peak season and the resort, any of the 3 resorts were not crazy packed so I don’t see how you can run out. As expected you only get their local or less premium alcohol available. That equals headache. There is only one bar that’s open to serve you. The pool swim up bar was never open. Don’t know why.

Food – Our first meal was dinner at Alexandra. It was terrible. We ordered a ravioli but it came out as lasagna form. I heard the lady from the table next to us complained too thinking it was a mix up. Apparently, they are not familiar with raviolis vs lasagna. On top of that, the lasagna shaped ravioli thing was dry on the sides. It’s hard to mess up on pasta dishes but apparently they did.

Service – We previously stayed at other hotels. We realize that island time exists and this is our 4th visit to the island. But the service speed is worst than normal island time. Staff is really inefficient and helping you out is not their priority if they are in the middle of some non customer facing tasks.

To make the best of your experience this is what I’d recommend. Go visit Blue Haven and Beach House and take advantage of their facilities.

Blue Haven was great because it’s more secluded and I love that there are hammocks on the beach. The pool itself is an infinity edge pool and the property is the nicer one of the 3 I feel. We had lunch there and their grilled chicken sandwich was great. Service is amazing. Shout out to Sisco! Super friendly and huge Boston Sports fan. We didn’t get a chance to try Fire and Ice restaurant but we heard it was nothing to rave about from other visitors.

Beach House is the best as far as all around service and food. Lunch is only served on the deck and dinner is at their Kitchen 218 restaurant. If you are staying at any of the 3 properties, I highly encourage that you do all your dining at Beach House. The restaurant is one of the better ones we have had on the island. All the staff are excellent and great. It’s a night and day experience between Beach House and Alexandra. One note – if you are visiting from other resorts, make sure you make reservations at the Beach House to use their beach chairs and Kitchen 218 for dinner. Also, on Tuesdays and Thursdays Kitchen 218 is closed.",Date of stay: February 2018,Alexandra Resort,4,Providenciales
A must for us every time we visit,"Great tex mex food. Good drinks and service is always on point. The location is right outside the snorkeling reef and they have a rooftop deck where you can catch the amazing sunsets of TCI. The price is reasonable compared to the pricier hotel restaurants on the beach. Good for groups, families, couples.",Date of visit: February 2018,Somewhere Cafe And Lounge,4,Providenciales
One of the better restaurants on the island,"My review is based on not having to pay the menu prices as we stayed at an all inclusive in Alexandra so we had access to Kitchen 218. We ate their 2 times. The food was one of the best we’ve had on the island and service is great. They are on top of your water, they serve at a really good pace. I know the Beach House Resort is Adults Only but I'm not sure if the restaurant is also. The fact that it was adults only at least when we went also made it perfect.",Date of visit: February 2018,Kitchen 218,4,Providenciales
Beatrice was fantastic,"Our favorite vineyard! We came here and did their food and wine pairing for only $15 Euro. Definitely worth it. We had the pleasure of having Beatrice as our host and not only is she familiar with the wine but there’s a lot of history and a great story behind this small family owned vineyard. The tasting room is very cozy and inviting. It’s like we walked into the family’s living room for a drink. The only thing that sucks is because we went later in the day, we didn’t get the chance to get a facility tour.",Date of experience: October 2017,Winemaker for a Day: Tour an Organic Winery,4,"Assisi, Italy"
Great first time visitor hotel!,"I was debating staying at the Southhampton Fairmont or the Hamilton Princess. A huge thanks to Caroline and Kathy from Hamilton Princess in helping me with educating about both properties and adjusting my booking confirmation during the start of their busy time. Although both properties are Fairmont, you can not use the other hotels amenities.

Here’s the breakdown of my review:

Location – This was an important factor for us as first time visitors. Location. Since the island does not offer have car rental, and we were not going to risk it on a scooter…we wanted easy public transportation access. The Hamilton Princess is right downtown where it is very easy to access the ferry and bus terminal if you want to leave the city of Hamilton. But it’s also great to be in the city where you can expand your dining option outside the hotel.

Rooms – Our room was gorgeous! We had a room in the main building with a balcony facing the dock and water. The views are beautiful. The room itself was updated and modern but one slight complaint is the wall seems to be too thin. I was able to hear people out in the hallway and even the littlest noise.

Beach – This hotel is not a beach front property. I don’t think many hotels in Bermuda are beachfront. Hamilton Princess does have a private beach that they took over when they bought the Old Sonesta Property but that is about a 20 minute free jitney ride from the hotel. The private beach is a little past the Horseshoe Bay Beach and as you are driving past the beaches before reaching to the private beach, you do see the color difference in the water. As another review have mentioned (Aug 2016), the private beach water seems to be greener like algae like and it’s due to maybe the circulation of the water? Not sure but I’m sure you can read up on all the scientific reasons. The amenities and facilities are great. They have tons of non-motorize sport items for you use (kayaks, paddleboard, various floaties).

Hotel Restaurants – Of the 3 nights we were there, we had dinner at Marcus and 1609. We had Marcus the first night and were not blown away. The restaurant had nice décor and there were some outdoor seating wrapped around the restaurant. The crowd was a little dressier. 1609 was the other restaurant on the property we went to. That is the best restaurant on the property. The views are a lot better than Marcus, the menu was a bit more diverse and the crowd is more casual. The best part was the create your own sundae. I’d def. say you can skip out on Marcus and go straight to 1609 for dinner.",Date of stay: May 2017,"Hamilton Princess & Beach Club, a Fairmont Managed Hotel",4,Bermuda
Prefer 1609 Over Marcus,"We stayed at the Hamilton Princess so we dined at Marcus the first night. The food, ambiance, service was good. But the menu diversity and the price for the type of food was high. We later went to 1609 the next night and everything was so much better, food, view, drinks, service and it was a bit more casual.",Date of visit: May 2017,Marcus Bermuda,4,Bermuda
Better than Marcus and Bouchee,"We had the best dinner here at 1609. We also went to Marcus and Bouchee.

1609 had good drinks and meal for the price. The view was beautiful. The restaurant was open, airy and casual. They had a pretty diverse menu and the create your own sundae dessert was the best part because you can add anything you want in a dessert into one dish.",Date of visit: May 2017,1609 Bar and Restaurant,4,Bermuda
Not Saint Martin French Good,We came here in hoping to get really good French food like we did in Saint Martin when we were there Dec 2016 but Bouchee was a bit disappointing. We ordered the fois gras and it was tasteless and the texture was weird. It was hard to break apart the fois gras. I ordered the duck which is what I always order at French restaurants and it was a bit overcooked and the sauce was a little heavy/thick.,Date of visit: May 2017,Bouchee,4,Bermuda
Can spend a whole day snorkeling and relaxing here,"We took a bus from Hamilton and walked down to Tabacco Bay. This is a great gem! The restaurant on it had a small food menu but the prices are great for the location and knowing how much more they can charge for. The Bay is just stunning. When we went, it was windy and cool so I didn't snorkel but my husband went in and he absolutely loved it. The water was clear and he saw many fish. I'm glad our snorkel trip got cancelled. It saved us a little less then $200 and we discovered this great spot that has one of the best snorkeling spots.",Date of experience: May 2017,Tobacco Bay,4,Bermuda
Most Beautiful Beach in the Carribean so far,"We have been to many Caribbean Islands (St. Barth's, St. Martin, Turks and Caicos, Cayman Island, etc) but Horseshoe Bay Beach is the most stunning one as far as the blue/green water and also the rock formation which gives the beach character and a ton of great picture opportunity. There are so much to do here than just beach lounging. You can walk around and discover little holes or caves and around the corner from each rock formation you discover more picturesque spots. We were blown away by how gorgeous this beach is. We went in mid May so it was not that crowded but I can imagine how crazy crowded this place could be, so I'd recommend coming early or know when cruise ships arrive so you can avoid that crow?

Also, because you can hike/climb on the rocks, I'd recommend water shoes if you want to explore. I wish I had my water shoes...",Date of experience: May 2017,Horseshoe Bay Beach,4,Bermuda
Busy but no access to waterfront if you're not dining,"We came here for drinks and hoped that we can get a water view spot and apparently that is reserved for diners only.

The bar area is small but they have a couple outdoor tables. The place seems to be the most happening place out of that area. The staff was very friendly.",Date of visit: May 2017,Wahoo's Waterside Bistro & Patio,4,Bermuda
Traveling to and from hotel,"This is our first all inclusive ever and we knew it wasn’t going to be our thing but might as well give it a try. Overall we didn't have a great experience and would never do all inclusive again but the property and decor was nice. My review is focused on getting around to and from the hotel

Getting to the hotel was easy, you just get a taxi at the airport and they will bring you over. The taxi doesn’t have a meter like NYC so you should ask how much it is before you hop in. The taxi from airport to hotel was $25. However, like another review said, the taxi from hotel to airport was only $20.

We also exited the property and did a snorkeling trip. We had to go to Paradise Island Ferry Terminal for us to dock. The taxi from hotel to terminal was $30 and the driver made us pay the $2 bridge toll.",Date of stay: February 2017,Meliá Nassau Beach - All Inclusive,4,New Providence Island
The Busiest French Restaurant in Grand Case,"My title is the ""Busiest French Restaurant"" because I can't say it's ""The Best French Restaurant"" because I haven't tried any other French restaurant in Grand Case to compare it to.

We only had one night in Grand Case and there are tons of French restaurants in the area. I have looked through the reviews and menus to narrow down which one I wanted to visit. My first choice wasn’t open on that Christmas night so we went to L’Auberge Gourmande. It did not disappoint! There are so many restaurants and choices down the street but L’Auberge Gourmande had the most patrons and there was a wait out the door. That cemented my decision on going here as my top choice. It was around 6:15PM when we got there without a reservation. The restaurant was already busy compared to the more empty neighboring restaurants and they said they were all booked for the night. Seeing we were super disappointed, the host/owner told us that we can try coming back 7:15PM incase one of their 7pm reservations is a no show. At this point, we decided to risk it and wait til 7:15 rather than going to another restaurant that can accommodate us right away.

Luckily our gamble paid off. We checked back into the restaurant and they did have some no shows. So we were lucky enough to experience L’Auberge Gourmande. We have been to this amazing French restaurant called So French the night before and fear that L’Auberge Gourmande would not match up to So French. But it did! L’Auberge Gourmande ambiance is more lively, noisier and busy but service is good none the less. The restaurant décor was very warm and homey. The food was good and the dish that stood out to me was the lobster bisque. Not a lot of lobster chunks like at other places I’ve had but it had a lot of flavor and wasn’t cream heavy. We also had the foie gras trio which allowed you to experience foie gras 3 different ways. Our entre which included the rack of lamb and braised beef was perfectly cooked.",Date of visit: December 2016,L'Auberge Gourmande,4,St Martin / St Maarten
Big resort with everything but in a windy and kinda remote location.,"I would give it 3.5 stars because of the location wasn't good but it was a big resort with lots of things to do on the property.

We selected the Westin because we thought it was at a good location which is located in the borderline of the Dutch and French side which we thought gives us easy access to the whole island since we have a car rental. The hotel itself is huge and has a lot of entertainment and activities itself. But we found it a little remote. It was a bit “far” from all the spots we were trying to hit up like Orient Bay, Grand Case, Simpson Bay, etc. It takes about 30 minutes to get to any of those location. If you do not have a car rental, the hotel is not at a central town or area. You can walk to a little area where there’s a pizza restaurant, seafood restaurant and an outdoor tour shop but that’s it.

If you are the hang around the resort kinda person, then Westin would be for you. The pool is big and they have a swim up bar area. When we were there around Christmas weekend, we had really nice weather but it always seem to be windy at the pool and beach. I think it’s the location or maybe it could just be the time I was there. There is a casino inside the resort and they also have an activity calendar if you want to exercise in the pool, chill and listen to live music, etc.",Date of stay: December 2016,"The Westin Dawn Beach Resort & Spa, St. Maarten",4,St Martin / St Maarten
Good spot but don't expect a 5 star service,"We stumbled upon this place on our last day as we were exploring the island. We got a table next to the bar and just ordered drinks. I know some reviews complained about the service but I think it’s efficient. This is a family owned restaurant and as it was very busy when we were there, the staff doesn’t have time to be patient if you are just dilly dallying around. They have a job to do and that’s getting food and drinks out the door, not to be your best friend.",Date of visit: December 2016,Chez Raymond,4,St Martin / St Maarten
Crew that loves what they do equals to great tour experience!,"Had a fantastic time with Mario and his crew!

They genuinely love what they do and they really care about the Sting Rays. They treat them like pets where each of them have names and they have a routine where they condition the Sting Rays when they visit. For example, other tour groups arrive at the site with food to lure the Sting Rays over to their boat. But with Mario and their crew, they didn’t have to do that and they recognize them and would come over. Also when it finally comes time to feeding, they told our group stand in a horse shoe shape to let them know it’s finally feeding time.

A great bonus with Aquarius is they do take photos for you for free. At first, I thought that meant they will just take your camera and take the picture for you. But they take pictures throughout the trip for you with their own camera. Mario always makes sure the pictures are perfect with everyone looking, sunlight position, etc. We had some great snorkeling pictures where Mario dives under water to shoot you from below.

I highly recommend Aquarius for your touring needs!",Date of experience: October 2015,Acquarius Sea Tours,4,Grand Cayman
Bad for couples but good for families with small kids,"We were hesitant on going to Turtle Farm but we had nothing to do so we went anyway. We did the farm tour and not the one where you visit the entire park. Our visit was disappointing for a couple going with no kids. It was neat to see the giant turtles but it’s not worth driving or making a trip out there if you’re a couple with no kids. For families with kids, it might be worth the visit as they have a water park and you see big turtles, birds, lizards, etc.",Date of experience: October 2015,Cayman Turtle Centre: Island Wildlife Encounter,4,Grand Cayman
Good special occasion dinner restaurant,"As far as quiet, upscale, romantic, nice dinner spot, this is the winner!

Came here the first night we arrived and was the best dinner we’ve had as far as freshness of the fish, menu diversity, service, nice quiet dinner. To compare to another similar restaurant on the same scale, we went to Blue Cilantro. I’d definitely choose Agua over Blue Cilantro. Both restaurants are good if you want to celebrate a special occasion or just have a nice dinner but Agua edged out because the menu selection was better and the drink menu was a little bigger.",Date of visit: October 2015,Agua,4,Grand Cayman
Better than Da Conch Shack,"We just came back from our 2nd visit to TCI. This is a 5 star review simply because it is better than Da Conch Shack. Just comparing Da Conch Shack vs. Bugaloo....Bugaloo's has a more diverse menu (they offer other fresh seafood other than conch), the beach is so much nicer (not too much seaweed or garbage in the water, sand is super fine and soft and music is great).

The place is great for couples or family. I have seen families bring their own beach chairs and just hang by the restaurant beach. It's the best where you get the beach and also bar service.

If you only have time to visit either Da Conch Shack or Bugaloo's, then go for Bugaloo's!",Date of visit: February 2015,Bugaloo's,4,Providenciales
Good break from all the seafood,"We passed on trying this place during our first visit because I remember reading it's a Chinese food place.

On this 2nd visit to TCI, we decided to stop by and take a look at the menu. The menu does have Chinese food, which is weird as I did not see any Chinese employees at the restaurant, so I decided to pass up on the Chinese menu. The rest of the menu was BBQ/Jerk meats which is what we ordered. We love that you can just order the meat itself with no sides as we need the protein and most sides on the island is not that healthy. This is a great spot for your meat craving as there are tons of seafood places on the island, but when you want some good BBQ meat, this is the place to go.",Date of visit: February 2015,Chinson's Grill Shack,4,Providenciales
Calm water and softest sand ever!,"This place is pure massage on my feet. The sand is super fine and soft. The scene is breath taking.

This is my #1 favorite place on TCI. A must visit!! Bring a tube or bed and just float on the calm water.",Date of experience: February 2015,Taylor Bay Beach,4,Providenciales
Downgrade my rating,"On our first visit to TCI, this was our #1 dining spot. But this visit, we have enjoyed Bugaloo's a lot more than Da Conch Shack so I am downgrading my review. It's still a good place to visit but compared to Bugaloo's I must rank Bugaloo's as #1 and Da Conch Shack as #2.",Date of visit: February 2015,da Conch Shack,4,Providenciales
Location is closer to Reefs than most restaurants,"Our first time to TCI and Gansevoort.

The hotel is gorgeous and beautiful no doubt. But let’s get to why I didn’t give the full 5 stars.

Very minor things:

1. Amenities - The sink is a double sink but where the water comes out of to the bottom of the sink meets is about a 2” to 3” clearance. Meaning you have to be very careful when trying to wash both your hands so it doesn’t touch the mouth of the pipe and the bottom of the sink. It was very inconvenient, however, they do have a kitchen sink you can use instead, that’s what we did.

2. Location - Before we decided on a hotel, it was between the Gansevoort and Seven Stars. After visiting the island, I think the location of Seven Stars is better. There’s shopping and more restaurants around the area. Gansevoort is however closer to the two snorkel sites. It’s between Bight Reef (5-10 minute walk on the beach) and to Smith’s Reef.

Overall, the hotel is beautiful, but we are ready to see what other hotels on TCI have to offer.",Date of stay: November 2013,Wymara Resort & Villas,4,Providenciales
Not the best beach front dining,"Did all the research to look for a restaurant for our anniversary dinner. Found Bay Bistro. It was our first night in TCI and our first dinner. Their website and reviews say it’s romantic and “Bay Bistro is closer to the beach than any other restaurant on Grace Bay.” So I thought I would call and make reservation for beach front dining. Apparently, they charge an extra $50 for that set up. We decided not to do it and sat on the deck.

Fast forward to a night or two later, we ate at Mango Restaurant and the hostess offered us beach front dining, and they don’t even charge extra for it!

The food was not memorable. Had the lobster tail and the tail seemed tough. Is that a sign that it’s not fresh?",Date of visit: November 2013,Bay Bistro,4,Providenciales
"Best beach front dining, food and service in Grace Bay!","Love! Love! Love this restaurant! As you can see in my other reviews we have been to a lot of restaurants in TCI. This is the best one to go for dinner! Ask for Donald! He is super friendly, attentive and just walks around with a smile on his face. This and Da Conch Shack are the only restaurants we’ve returned back to.

Ambiance – We checked in with the hostess and she asked if we wanted beach front dining. We said yes and we were escorted to a group of tables surrounded by tiki torches and candle lit tables right on the beach! It was beautiful! Then I had to ask if this would cost us extra to sit on the beach as Bay Bistro would charge you extra $50 for this setting. She said no. We ate right on the beach with our feet resting in the soft sand.

Food – Prices are good for the area restaurant. It’s not expensive. Moderate prices. The food is well cooked. I think Donald mention the chef is from the Philippines so you have some Asian inspired dishes. The menu is HUGE! So you will definitely find something you like.

Alcohol – They have the most extensive and “cheapest” place to get cocktails. Drinks are $9 compared to $12 and up for other neighboring restaurants.

Service – Ask for Donald! Best service ever!",Date of visit: November 2013,Mango Reef,4,Providenciales
