Superb fishing day out,"A massive thank you to Captain Michalis, Antonia and Hassan for another wonderful day, This was our 2nd year running we have been on this trip and again we were were not disappointed .

Day starts with coffee and cake and followed by a gentle cruise to lay and pick up nets. The fishing was as great as before; followed by a short cruise to a wonderful bay were swimming and snorkelling is a must.

Lunch was amazing with Bruschetta and fish soup to start followed by lobster and other sea food all from the earlier catch, all washed down with some local wine.

Canâ€™t recommend this trip enough, well worth every single penny.",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
