A quiet sushi restaurant just a stone’s throw away from Authent Hotel Otaru,"We had a bus back to Kiroro booked at 6.20 pm from Authent Hotel Kiroro and were looking for a good sushi restaurant within walking distance. Savor Japan recommended Sushi Restaurant Shun so we have it a try. A very nice smallish place run by the chef and great value sushi sets in which you leave it to the chef to decide - just choose 9 pieces, 10 pieces or 11 pieces. We also ordered the thick cut grilled sea eel and it was so nice and succulent we ordered two more. Very friendly service and we will definitely pop by again. A nice find in a town known for great sushi.",Date of visit: December 2019,Sushi Restaurant  Shun,4,"Otaru, Japan"
How can you not pay a visit,"Despite the queues outside, it’s an essential stop to the outlet that started it all - a place where all the wait staff are speaking in diff languages to handle all the tourists from many parts of the world. Food is of course Din Tai Fung consistent and excellent but you didn’t just come for the food - you came to experience the Real McCoy.",Date of visit: December 2019,Din Tai Fung (Xinyi),4,"Zhongzheng District, Taipei"
My first stay here - will definitely return,"Based on glowing TA reviews and the fact that the use of a washer and dryer are essential for family trips, I booked this City Inn at the Ximending Branch. What I can say, the reviews are spot on and thank you to all who have come before me for the recommendation. Location is absolutely perfect - a stone’s throw from the hustling and bustling Ximending shopping and eating with a mall just opposite with a basement supermarket and Ximending train station exit 3 just opposite the hotel. It is not a luxury hotel but 6 star in terms of service and you can see the attention to detail in the weight machine in the lobby with the various airlines’ baggage weight limits. Every convenience for the traveller has been thought through in advance. We enjoyed the bright and clean lounge area in the basement - after many a long lonely wait for my washing to be done in dingy laundry rooms, this is such a nice bonus to have a nice area with a computer and free coffee, milk tea, hot chocolate and snacks to wait in. City Inn just hits the spot in all the right details.

I could stop there but I do need to mention the one glaring difference between this hotel and others - the service is amazing! Special mention to Bonnie and the night staff - you made it wonderful. A special touch and a quick eye to offer help - thanks for a great stay and we will never stay anywhere else the next time we are in Taipei. Check out my photo - I returned to my room to find my messy charging cables neatly bundled up with a strip of Velcro. Lovely.",Date of stay: December 2019,CityInn Hotel Plus - Ximending Branch,4,"Zhongzheng District, Taipei"
Excellent location if you want to be near MBK and Chinatown,"4 min walk to National Stadium BTS station and MBK shopping centre. We needed a family sized room with washer and dryer for our family of four and this was perfect. Breakfasts were good as well - made to order eggs, pancakes, waffles and oatmeal. Service very efficient - didn’t know how to work the dryer and they came twice almost immediately. Will return. Studio apartment was spotless with a cute small pool.",Date of stay: November 2019,LiT BANGKOK Residence,4,"Bangkok, Thailand"
Must try for old school chinese,Must try for old school chinese favorites - best meal we had for reasonable prices and the roast pig is out of this world. No credit cards accepted. Oyster omelette and crab with glass noodles was perfection and the crab fried rice was laden with big white juicy crab chunks,Date of visit: November 2019,Tang Jai Yoo,4,"Bangkok, Thailand"
Great way to see the surrounding parts of Bangkok,We had a great time doing the weekend edition which involved a trip to the weekend market which was much less touristy than other markets we had been too. Pace of the cycling was very good given that we had two 12 year olds on the trip - better than some of the other cycling tours we had tried in the region. Some parts of the trail are narrow and on elevated pathways so if you are not too confident on a bike then this is not for you but really pace was relaxed so you can take it slowly. Highly recommended as a nice break from the main city and wonderful guides accompanied us. Crossing the river was also a nice part which our kids really enjoyed.,,Colors of Bangkok,4,"Bangkok, Thailand"
Good location and perfect rooms,"Everything you want for a central Seoul stay, on the airport limousine shuttle bus stop, opposite a historic palace site for a morning walk, plenty of cafes nearby and a short stroll to Myeong-dong if that’s your scene. Rooms are very new, Molton Brown toiletries and great view of the Blue House in the distance. Staff are very courteous and go out of their way to help.",Date of stay: July 2019,"THE PLAZA Seoul, Autograph Collection",4,"Seoul, South Korea"
Good Burgers just off the main walking street in Pai,"We had very yummy burgers with thick beef patties, we ordered the classic beef burger with bacon which is served with a thick layer of fatty bacon which went well with the burger. All burgers come with homemade thick cut fries. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. They also run a stand-alone stall on the walking street in the evenings.",Date of visit: June 2019,Grunge Burger,4,"Pai, Thailand"
Good stay if you want to be right in the night bazaar,"This is an older hotel with a great location - right opposite the Anusarn market and in the middle of the night bazaar. Plenty of foot massage places next to the hotel for a quick foot massage and a Big C supermarket a quick walk down the street. Facilities wise the hotel is decent value, don’t expect spanking new facilities but you are here for convenience and location. Breakfasts are ok but nothing to shout about.",Date of stay: June 2019,Dusit Princess Chiang Mai,4,"Chiang Mai, Thailand"
Well located hotel,Good facilities and good location next to a skytrain station. Restaurants are sometimes fully occupied for conferences but there are lots of other places nearby to eat. Room is in good condition but if you have to take a cab it is not that easy to find one in a hurry as there is often a traffic jam on the streets in front of the hotel.,Date of stay: June 2019,Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4,"Bangkok, Thailand"
Great Mini Pancakes,"This small street stall seems nondescript, but grandma serves 8 small and delicious pancakes with many topping options. She serves them on a banana leaf plate and a thick covering at the bottom so you do not get burnt by the freshly cooked pancakes.",Date of visit: June 2019,Grandma's Pancakes,4,"Pai, Thailand"
Family room in a great location,"We were looking for a nice conveniently located boutique hotel near the walking street with a family room so we chose this hotel. It was all that and more. We loved the simple yet elegant interior and comfortable beds, good shower and wonderful breakfasts. Our hosts were also very friendly and welcoming and the Witching Well restaurant downstairs where breakfast is served has an excellent wine selection. Breakfast is made to order and you are given vouchers up to a certain value. We looked forward to breakfast every day - some recommendations are the pancakes, avocado lovers and the French toast. Kids had banana chocolate smoothies every morning. If you have a chance - their salmon cream pasta is also very tasty. Laundry is available throughout Pai town itself at very reasonable prices.",Date of stay: June 2019,Otium Boutique Room,4,"Pai, Thailand"
Good pit stop for burgers,We were craving some good burgers one night in Pai and decided to try Burger Queen after reading some reviews - well worth the dinner in a town with very good options - chips were home made with tasty garlic mayonnaise and a good selection of burgers. Definitely a safe bet for a burger craving!,Date of visit: June 2019,Maya Burger Queen,4,"Pai, Thailand"
Our base for our family trip to Pai,"We stayed at the Otium Boutique Rooms and had breakfast every day at the Witching Well - it was the best breakfast we had on our whole trip to Northern Thailand. Good avocado on toast with bacon, pancakes and muesli/yoghurt/fruit. The French Toast is also excellent, thick and fluffy and not greasy with the perfect smattering or marmalade and honey on the side. They also serve good pizza and a very tasty salmon tomato cream pasta. An excellent selection of wine is also available.",Date of visit: June 2019,Witching Well Restaurant and Wine Bar,4,"Pai, Thailand"
"5 star location, 5 star rooms, but what happened to the breakfast facilities","Location is excellent right in the heart of Bukit Bintang, lots to see and do at night. Rooms and lobby area recently renovated and perfect. Reception staff and porters hit the perfect note and what you would expect from a JW Marriott property. The receptionist (Jeremy) was awesome. All in all a good stay, the only thing that stood out like a sore thumb were the breakfast facilities, clearly not enough for the guests, wait staff were stressed trying to cope and food was mediocre - we have had so much better at 4 star hotels so this was jarring. The only thing that the hotel could really work on improving. The only good station was the roti canai station. I was shocked to see a nasi lemak offering at a top hotel with lumpy rice and watery sambal - quite sad as for most of the guests this would have been their first encounter with this national dish. Come on Marriott, you can do better.",Date of stay: February 2019,JW Marriott Kuala Lumpur,4,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"
Excellent guides and fantastic organization,"We took an early morning trip (starts about 6 am) with WWC. Wonderful organization from start to finish, all the nice touches along the way by the crew - from offering sea sickness pills and a cup of tea or coffee at the ticket office to ensuring that everyone on the boat gets a good view of the whales or dolphins. Other boats were terribly crowded but this was fine. Breakfast, fruits, bottled water and a nice chilled bottle of Coke also provided along the way with a nice roti and sambol snack towards the end of the trip. Life jackets are provided and the crew took extra care to tie down our bags on the boat. The captain and his crew communicate amongst themselves throughout the trip to ensure that we could spot the next emergence of the whale and are very friendly and professional. One of the best group tours I have encountered. Kids loved the trip and we loved the obvious enthusiasm of the crew who loved pointing out any nearby animals in the sea from sea turtles to dolphins and the whales. Don’t miss this great opportunity to see the whales with this company.",Date of experience: December 2018,Whale Watching Club,4,"Mirissa, Sri Lanka"
A nice find!,"We found references to this restaurant on the net and decided to drop by. Starving after the train ride to Ella, so we wanted some quick bites to fortify us until dinner. Ordered some pasta dishes for the kids and some bites. Turned out to be so perfectly well prepared and tasty that we wished we could have ordered more. Some Japanese style snacks (karaage) - all good. Pasta was excellent and perfectly done. More items on the menu but we were in between meals.",Date of visit: November 2018,AK Ristoro,4,"Ella, Sri Lanka"
Superb,One night was not enough. From the moment we pulled up to the main bungalow and spotted the rustic playground and the rose bushes. A perfect combination of a holiday bungalow feel with all the amenities of a fully equipped hotel and discreet service staff. Good WiFi and cable tv in the rooms. All amenities provided and wonderful dinner menu and wonderful breakfast. Attention to detail for all physical comforts and best of all the view of the train in the morning on the nine arch bridge and crossing through the town can’t be beat. Check with the staff on the train times so you can catch one at brekkie. Best pancakes we have had in Sri Lanka and we had the Secret Special Sri Lankan steamed fish which was excellent. Definitely a place in which we want to return with our kids and the extended family in tow. Nice infinity pool - smallish but sufficient and we saw some weasel scurrying past the area as well. If you watch carefully you can see some fireflies at night.,Date of stay: November 2018,The Secret Ella,4,"Ella, Sri Lanka"
Oasis in Kandy,"Danger - once you get in here it is very hard to tear yourself away as it does feel very much like the well-appointed home of a friend. Comes with a pool table which our kids loved every evening. Good WiFi connection in the rooms as well. The highlight of the stay for us was the wonderful food and service, we don’t normally eat in the hotel if we have a choice but this was the exception as once we had sampled the dinner on the first evening, we just wanted to have it again the next night. Both Western and Sri Lankan options are available and both equally good so you can have the best of both worlds at one sitting. We loved the homemade tomato soup so much we kept reordering, banana fritters with ice cream were out of this world, great steak and rice and curry sets. Bathrooms were great, loved the towels and cable TV provided. There is an external laundry shop nearby the hotel which sadly we didn’t get to use as we arrived too late in the evening. The team running the hotel are friendly and also strike the right balance in a boutique hotel. Only downside is as stated above, because it is such a nice place to chill and the kids love it too, you will not want to leave the villa!!!",Date of stay: November 2018,Clove Villa,4,"Kandy, Sri Lanka"
Wear proper shoes with grip and bring a torchlight if going up at sunset,"This is a good climb with some hairy bits at the top part - if you wear good shoes and a back pack to free up your hands as you will need them for the climb. If you are attempting this at sunset, bring a torchlight or enough battery in your smartphone to ensure you have light for the journey back down. Our kids (13 and 10 years) had no issue with the help of our guide who was great at telling them how to navigate the rocks at the top part. Wonderful view from the top made it worthwhile. Don’t feed the dogs up there though as they will follow you around after that.",Date of experience: November 2018,Pidurangala Rock,4,"Sigiriya, Sri Lanka"
Excellent base for Sigiriya and Pidurangala visits,"We are a family of four with two kids and we stayed in a quad tree house for two nights. We had an excellent stay and enjoyed it thoroughly. Nothing like waking up to the sounds of the jungle around you and a great breakfast. The staff at the hotel are incredibly friendly and went well out of their way to help us. We had went on a hike to Pidurangala with Tusita, from the hotel and he was an extremely experienced guide and shared his knowledge of the site and history, one of the best guides we have had on our trip. Some parts of the climb at the top were a little difficult as you have to use your hands and feet to scramble up the rock and he was very patient with our group. The dinners were great as well and we enjoyed our mealtimes having a chat with the team at BoB. In terms of facilities, the treehouse is really almost part of the jungle - you will have to expect some bugs in the bathroom and some possible monkey incursions but if you take care and follow the instructions from the staff as we did, we had no issues. Kids very happy with trying to spot monkeys in the tree and catch daddy long legs in the bathroom. Adults very happy to have an excuse to wean kids off some WiFi for a change. WiFi is available at the lobby. Bring your own toothbrush but shower gel, shampoo and towels are provided. Bring your own rubber flip flops for convenience if possible. In short, we missed the kindness of the team at BoB which made a big difference to our stay - much better than an impersonal chain hotel.",Date of stay: November 2018,Back of Beyond Jungle Hideaway - Pidurangala,4,"Sigiriya, Sri Lanka"
Annual Pilgrimage to the Line,Every National Day weekend we head to the Line for our favourite dinner buffet and durian buffet usually available during this period. It is one of the few buffet restaurants that has actually held up its standard over the last five years. Don’t forget to look for Uncle Eskay at the outside part of the restaurant who will personally open durians for you and you can eat them before heading back in to the main restaurant for dessert. Good choice of seafood and mains.,Date of visit: August 2018,The Line,4,"Singapore, Singapore"
Great trip and very efficient travel agency in Greece,"Just returned from a ten day trip to Athens, Naxos and Santorini - ably assisted by Makis who helped us with all the ferry, land transfers and hotel bookings. Planning it was very simple with Makis suggesting hotels within our budget and replacements if our first choice was not available. Fantasy Travel is a very good choice to assist with the travel planning for free and easy trips to Greece - once you get there you can plan what else you want to do in each location.",Date of experience: June 2018,Fantasy Travel,4,"Athens, Greece"
Superb view and excellent service,"We stayed in a deluxe suite with our kids and everything was just perfect. You order your breakfast the night before and they bring it to you on your balcony. We loved the greek scrambled eggs the most and the chocolate marble cake. Location is ideal, gets you the best view in Thira. Do take note that as you are staying on the cliff, you will have to walk out to the main street for meeting points for boat tours, etc. as the cars cannot get to your hotel. It is not a bother at all as the views are wonderful from your room. Service is excellent and discreet as well. Your hotel rooms are cleaned twice a day. Special thanks to Christina at the front desk for helping us with dinner reservations and tour suggestions. Even if it was last minute, she managed to secure us very good tables with sunset views.",Date of stay: June 2018,Athina Luxury Suites,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Bring water and try your best to wear running shoes,"We started out at 10 am from Fira and took a very long time to reach Oia in part cos we needed to stop for drinks and photographs along the way. All in all it was nearly 5 hours. First part is easy as you are walking through towns but once you get past the drinks stop at the side of the road, it gets gravelly and covered shoes are the best option. Having said that our kids survived with their sandals. We stopped along the way to get two drinks from a cafe but I would advise to bring your own water to the maximum extent possible as it is a long uphill climb towards the last stretch towards Oia.",Date of experience: June 2018,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,4,"Santorini, Greece"
The best thing we did on our whole trip to Greece,"We were looking for a fishing trip in Greece and found this tour on tripadvisor. We knew that this was gonna be fun but did not fully appreciate how much fun we were going to have. I think the main thing that sets this tour apart from the rest is the warmth of Captain Anthi and her crew and the true passion she has for this. Our kids thoroughly enjoyed themselves on the boat and managed to catch their own fish using either hand lines or fishing rods. The fish and octopus were cooked on board and absolutely delicious. The superlatively hardworking crew and captain have something special here and we would recommend this over any standard sunset cruise. Kids get to swim as well and snorkels, towels and drinks are provided. There is a toilet on board the boat. We would recommend this to anyone who wants to do something really different in Santorini.",,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Great private guide for Naxos,"We had a very good day tour with Nicolas - family of four with two young kids above 10. Nicolas is able to engage the kids with his in-depth explanations of the history, buildings and countryside which is no mean feat for young children. We didn’t know that he also does hikes around Naxos, something to consider next time.",Date of experience: May 2018,Naxos Discovery Private Guided Tours,4,"Naxos, Greece"
Good stay for families,"We enjoyed our stay here, perfect for families as there is self serve laundry facilities and a small kitchenette with everything you need provided in the kitchenette. They supply nespresso capsules (1 box) and basic stuff like eggs, bread, milk, OJ, butter, very nice jam and a whole bunch of apples every three days, more than enough for us as there are tonnes of cafes in town and on the slopes. We stayed in an executive studio which was large and the kids loved the Apple TV and Netflix after skiing in the day. Right round the corner is Haus St Anton cafe which is great for a coffee and a nice cinnamon roll and next to Address Nozawa itself is Genki Burger - very good burgers and open slightly later. Kaori San was great at helping us with local reservations and directions. Only slight downside is that the hotel onsen itself is not new but as you are in a town with so many real onsens outside this is not an issue at all. O-Yu onsen is just a short 2 min walk away and the long escalator to the Hikage Slopes are about 10 min walk up the town. It could be shorter but we kept getting diverted with all the snacks/shops along the way. No hesitation returning to Address Nozawa as it hit the spot for the entire family. Also - hotel provides a small onsen bag/kit for each guest, nice touch!",Date of stay: March 2018,Address Nozawa,4,"Nozawaonsen-mura, Japan"
Great Coffee & gelato,Good stop for daily coffee and cinnamon rolls. Kids loved the gelato and oyaki buns too. They also sell very nice jams of all kinds and make very tasty toasted sandwiches. The branch at the slopes also provides the same great coffee and ski rental services.,Date of visit: March 2018,Haus St. Anton Jam Factory & Cafe,4,"Nozawaonsen-mura, Japan"
Reservation only dinner,We didn't stay here but booked a dinner at the Kiriya Ryokan for the family. The kaiseki and sukiyaki dinner menu was wonderful and we really enjoyed the meal as we didn't stay at a traditional ryokan and wanted to try a traditional dinner. Owner was very friendly and the Ryokan has a very homely feel - definitely a place we would consider if we wanted to try a Ryokan the next visit. Menu was reasonably priced for the dinner. You have to book the dinner in advance.,Date of stay: March 2018,Nozawa Onsen Kiriya Ryokan,4,"Nozawaonsen-mura, Japan"
Wonderful time for families,"Booked the ninja experience without too much idea of what it involved. Kids and their dad really enjoyed it as it was very well conducted in fluent English and they got a very good lesson in history, ninja methods and weapons. All three came back talking about the session for the next two hours so it really made an impression. They also allow other members of the family to watch as spectators for a smaller fee which is great as it is equally fun to watch the session from the sidelines. One of the best experiences we have had in Tokyo and for families wanting to do something really interesting, highly recommended. Bring your phones and charge them up as you will want to take a lot of photos. We liked the fact that this was really run by the clan themselves and it added to the experience. You can find the location of the building by keying it into google maps and going to basement floor level 4.",Date of experience: March 2018,Musashi Ninja Clan Shinobi-Samurai Honjin Dojo,4,"Shibakoen, Japan"
5 Star but only just...,"Stayed in a two room suite - pros were that the room was lovely, the view of the river from the balcony was great, location was wonderful in the sense that you were not directly in the jostling part of Jonker Street but a short 2 min walk away. Some nice touches like welcome sorbet and peppermint towels, watermelon served at the pool area, drinking chocolate sachets at night.

Breakfast was alright, but at the prices paid I would have just expected a little more. Service staff at the restaurant varied in terms of service. Some were good, others plain did not know what you were asking which was strange at a hotel at this level. We would often had to repeat a request at breakfast, which is really not something you would expect at the hotel at this level, so hence the title of this rating,..

I would stay here again as the location is good and why go to Malacca to end up in the mall side of town...liked the location, the physical facilities of the hotel most of all.",Date of stay: February 2015,Casa del Rio Melaka,4,"Melaka, Malaysia"
Good for business,"You can't go wrong with the Kowloon Shangrila if you have to stay in Kowloon for business. Location is great, with a view of the harbour if you ask for one and an MTR stop just 1 min away from the hotel. Not too much by way of local food/shopping near the hotel though, you will have to walk through the underground to get to some good local eateries. Good for a business trip when you won't have much time to meander as service is fast and efficient.",Date of stay: March 2012,Kowloon Shangri-La Hong Kong,4,"Hong Kong, China"
HK at its best...,"Stayed in many HK hotels from the 5 star to the well, not so 5 star hotels and MO will always have a special place, maybe it was the view of the harbour from the room, maybe it was the luxe toiletries...maybe it was the slightly 70's balcony...maybe it was the view of the square from the room with all the great skyscrapers around it...a certain something that lifted it up beyond the usual 5 star hotel experience. The room itself was not big, the bed dwarfed it but that too is the quintessential HK experience in itself. Can't beat the location as well, smack in the heart of things. Stay here if you want to imagine yourself in some HK movie.",Date of stay: July 2011,"Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong",4,"Hong Kong, China"
Basic hotel for business,"If you have business in Wanchai, this is probably a decent choice. Not too near the MTR, at least an 7-8 min walk through a rather hum drum commercial street. Hotel itself is basic and pool area needs updating and can get crowded.",Date of stay: June 2011,Novotel Century Hong Kong,4,"Hong Kong, China"
Good location in Wangfujing,Walking distance to the Wangfujing shopping drag. A decent business hotel but rooms not much to shout about by Asian hotel standards. Breakfast is decent. Main plus point is its close proximity to Wangfujing and some interesting food stalls on the street.,Date of stay: October 2011,Crowne Plaza Beijing Wangfujing,4,"Beijing, China"
Lone Pine is back!,"I stayed here as a kid in the 70s and still remember the sheer size of the rooms...that hasn't changed and was thrilled to bring my 2 kids back to the new Lone Pine. We booked a super deluxe room which had another small room with a bed annexed to the main room...needless to say, my kids were thrilled at the concept of their own little playroom/bedroom. They took every bath in the bathtub on the balcony with the coconut shell water scoop...you can watch over them on the day bed on the balcony as well, our room was huge. A wedding was held while we were there, it was noisy and lasted a bit late into the night...but we weren't terribly affected we were in the deluxe/super deluxe rooms which are in the new wing and further away from the site of the wedding itself...may be best to avoid the garden wing on weekends when there is probably going to be a wedding or stay there during the Hungry Ghost month when very few weddings are held! We had two kids who slept cheerfully through the entire thing, one of which slept through the entire thing and the other one got a kick out of seeing a wedding from the balcony...and the setting is so lovely, we found it hard put to begrudge some people having a bit of a party after a wedding. Great setting for a beachfront wedding too, I might add...No issues with housekeeping, staff was very friendly and drinks in the minibar (non-alcoholic) are complimentary - rare but appreciated. Breakfast was good. Bear in mind that you will not get bacon in most hotels in Malaysia as the food in such places has to be halal...but overall a nice mix of local and western choices. We usually resist hotel breakfasts in Penang as Penang is a gastronomic destination in itself but it was telling that the draw of the freshly squeezed fruit/veges juices delivered to your table, teh tarik, freshly fried Char Kuay Teow from a dedicated CKT fry station and a charcoal grill just for your kaya toast drew us every morning. Most hotels, even the 5 star ones in this region, just serve you the usual canned juices..nasty stuff. A very nice alternative to the whole string of chain hotels in the Batu Ferringhi area, this is going to be our favourite hotel in Penang. Very nice setting, all rooms face the sea. Great for kids.",Date of stay: March 2012,Lone Pine Hotel,4,"Penang Island, Malaysia"
Kids love this,"Great for the little ones in rainy weather, bring your own socks and put on long sleeved shirts for the kids to avoid friction burns.",Date of experience: March 2012,Adventure Zone,4,"Penang Island, Malaysia"
Hard to find but worth the effort,"Very nice old school place - been there 70 years next to a temple that has been there since 1799! Possible to walk on the beach after dinner when it's low tide, bring a torchlight...baked crab runs out fast, best to book in advance.",Date of visit: March 2012,Sea Pearl Lagoon Cafe,4,"Penang Island, Malaysia"
Not next to the KLCC but almost there!,"We stayed here with our kids and grandparents. Booked a two bedroom but on arrival was told that we would have to split up into two single bedroom units, which was not an issue with us. Rooms come with a semi-equipped kitchenette, living room and separate bedroom. They are not brand new but maintained well. Washing machines/dryers are at the top level next to the pool and breakfast area. Nice rooftop pool and jacuzzi. If you are staying on the weekends/holidays, expect to have to sit outside as breakfast area gets crowded and breakfasts are alright, not the 5 star levels in other Asian hotels. It will do the job, but then you are in KL, so you can get much better food all around the city, who cares about breakfast? Best plus point is that it was a very short walk to the KLCC and the Petronas Science Centre which the kids enjoyed.",Date of stay: July 2011,Ascott Kuala Lumpur,4,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"
