Exhilarating,It was a exhilarating experience being able to drive a speed boat. My 14 year old son suggested this to me and I'm so glad I did it.,Date of experience: August 2020,Captain Manolis Fishing Trips in Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
Well worth it!,My 14 years talked me into parasailing and some inflatable watersports and I m so glad I did it. Well worth it. Parasaung was actually quite relaxing and the UFO was certainly an adrenaline ride.,Date of experience: August 2020,Sotos Water Sports,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
