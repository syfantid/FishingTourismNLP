0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelA955,October 2020,5,A great insight into the fishing life of Kefalonia combined with amazing food and great swimming and relaxation too!,"Thank you for Michalis and Antonia for looking after us all so beautifully yesterday. As a family of six adults we were greeted on the dock with home made cake and coffee before we set off and then experienced in a very small way the life of the fishing boat. 2km of nets pulled in, hard work, brutal at times, explained in Antonia’s excellent English. The fabulous appetiser and lunch interspersed time swimming in the azure seas and diving off the boat. By the time we set off back for the port we were all happily full, relaxed and tired. What a lovely day out! "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emybee393,September 2020,5,Unforgettable Experience,"Wow! What an incredible experience this was! Antonia and Michalis are wonderful, friendly people and they truly make you feel like family. Everything in the description is accurate and it’s worth your time and money! From helping with the catch, enjoying the ride on open water, eating a fabulous meal, swimming in a secluded area, to laughing and chatting, it’s truly magical. I hope to visit Kefalonia again so I can book this trip! Don’t hesitate! Book now!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R7767OTkarinr,August 2020,5,Great relaxing day out,Amazing day out with Antonia and Michalis. First great fishing adventure; getting to see the nets being brought up and the catch of the day. Very fascinating for kids. Afterwards you stop by in a small secluded bay where you can swim and jump off the boat while Antonia prepares the most amazing fish-based lunch. We found it really interesting to have time to speak to Antonia too and ask her about local customs and other things we'd been wondering about Greece and the islands.  A great day out that I can warmly recommend!
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malt73,August 2020,5,Fantastic day out with the best food!,"Absolutely fabulous day out with Michalis Fishing. Antonia greeted us with Greek coffee and the most fabulous cake which her daughter had made. Once the other two families had joined us we set sail for where Captain Michalis had set the nets the previous day. We watched as the nets were reeled in and the catch was removed from the nets, and then we stopped in a lovely bay for a swim. Whilst we relaxed in the water Antonia made the most delicious bruschetta with all fresh ingredients - so tasty.  Then we set sail for an alternative spot for another swim stop whilst lunch was prepared. I can’t describe how fantastic the food was. A good fish restaurant in London would have charged a small fortune for half of what we ate. Absolutely beautiful. The wine and water flowed all day too. After lunch and another few swims and relaxing on the boat in the sun we set off back to the marina. It was the perfect day. The hosts were so friendly and it was really interesting watching the nets being brought up and emptied. And then the catch being turned into our lunch! But even if you don’t have the remotest interest in fishing you will still have a great day out on the water with lovely people. We would thoroughly recommend it. If you’re concerned about Covid-19 this year I can assure you they very much look after you - The boat is bigger than I expected but they don’t take out too many people so social distancing is not a problem. With temperature checks etc on arrival they clearly take every precaution to make sure everything is safe for their guests. We absolutely loved it and will definitely book when we’re next in Kefalonia. Thank you to everyone on board for making our day so special. Kat and Jonathan. X"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Great_Expectations75,August 2020,5,This trip is a must if you like (love?) great food,"Let me just say this: before this trip, I had never NOT finished a lobster. With Michalis, we had so much of it (wonderfully cooked, just absolutely stunningly delicious!) that we just couldn't eat it any more! Antonia is a wonderful cook and a brilliant host. We didn't catch much fish, but what we did catch was: a stingray (threw it back overboard), crabs (ditto), a shark (ditto), octopus (cooked and ate), a scary looking fish (overboard), and a few plain looking fish (also overboard as there were just too few of them to cook). Kids had a great time, we all ate loads, jumped and dived off the boat into crystal clear water of the lagoon Antonia's husband took us to while we were waiting for our lunch to be cooked. This trip is a must, really, and we'll definitely be doing it again when we're back in Kefalonia."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeepFriedDodo,July 2020,5,A Trip to Remember!,"This was a lovely day trip which ticked all the boxes. Antonia was an excellent host and catered for everyone's needs at all times. We were looked after from the second we stepped on board until after we'd returned home. We saw our lobster caught in front of our eyes, were able to take pictures with the lobster and witnessed the preparation. Whilst cooking was ongoing we were dropped off at a secluded beach only accessible by boat, where we could swim  on the shores. Food was served with the most gorgeous fish soup made fresh from what was caught in the nets, rich lobster with pasta (for a first time eater) and finished with watermelon. This was all on top of the refreshments provided throughout the trip. On our return we witnessed how nets were relaid and we were given all the information we needed in perfect English. We were even lucky enough to have a few turtles circling the boat, alongside seeing all the fish in the crystal clear water. The trip was a delight, brilliant value for money and I would recommend to anyone."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelankiw,July 2020,5,Amazing day out fishing,"Best day of the trip, helped with the fishing nets and swam at a secluded beach while our lunch was being prepared. We got to see a few turtles as well, circling our boat while we were eating! Had a lovely lobster spaghetti as well as other fresh Greek dishes. Very friendly and excellent service, and really good communication. Really appreciated the quick responses whenever we had any questions beforehand, and thanking us by text soon after the trip and sending us photos, really added a personal touch. Would highly recommend to anyone who loves fishing, seafood and the sea!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShanahA,July 2020,5,Must have experience in Kefalonia,"Amazing authentic fishing experience! As a family of four with two little ones, we had a blast. Especially, the kids who were in awe of the fishing experience. Delicious lunch with wine and beer to top it off. Highly recommended!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrsbonjovi59,October 2019,5,Lifetime experiance,My hubby has done this trip now twice. Once in May then in October. Both trips for him was fantastic. Truly what he wanted which was a hands on experience on a fishing boat. The company on board with the family was excellent. Good fun and good food and I know he would go again next year. Thank you to Antonia and her family for making him feel at home. Yours Janet and Michael ellis. Pesssda.
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mervrothwell,June 2019,5,AMAZING DAY,All I can say is that this was one of the best trips I have ever done on a holiday abroad. Experience life on a real fishing boat and be fed by what you catch on the day. Food is amazing. A big thank you to Antonia and Michalis - totally charming and extremely friendly. Good luck with your business. Saganaki!
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyvM1352SU,October 2019,5,Fantastic Day,We met up with them at the dock and promptly got on the boat and had coffee and cake.  After visiting for a few minutes we were off to find the nets.  They reeled in the net and we got to pick the fish out.  Many varieties and sizes.  After we finished the nets they motored over to a nice cove for swimming and lunch.  Wonderful food!  Fresh caught fish cooked to perfection.  At the end of the day we motored back to the dock!  It was an excellent day.  Wonderful hosts!
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S8673EYsimonep,September 2019,5,FISHING TRIP WITH ANTONIA AND MICHALIS ON 30 SEPTEMBER 2019,"We had a fabulous day with Antonia and Michalis on Monday 30 September 2019.  We were picked up by Antonia and taken to the boat early in the morning. When everyone had arrived, there were 11 of us, we were served coffee and homemade cake which was lovely.  We then set sail for the nets.  When the nets were being pulled up the men on board enjoyed helping taking the fish from the nets.  We were then taken to a beautiful cove where you could only get to by boat.   While we snorkelled Antonia prepared a magnificent lunch.  The wine was made from their own grapes and the olive oil from their own olive trees which tasted superb.We met some lovely people on the trip from Italy, Holland and the UK who made the trip memorable.We cannot fault the trip even though I am not normally a boat lover!  Antonia and Michalis were wonderful hosts and we will definitely go again when we return to Kefalonia! Hopefully next year :)"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alison18,September 2019,5,Our favourite day of our holiday,"We had a fantastic day with Antonia and Michalis on board their working fishing boat. We met at 8am and were welcomed with Greek coffee and cake and a chance to chat to the other members of the group. Two couples had taken the trip previously which was a good sign. Having set sail we then watched the 2km of nets being brought in with the opportunity to help if you wanted to. There was a great mixture of fish including red mullet, German fish, scorpion fish, cuttle fish and a slipper lobster. We sailed to a cove only accessible by boat and swam in the clear waters whilst Antonia prepared lunch. A Greek bruschetta laden with fresh vegetables was a tasty appetiser whilst we waited for the main course of seafood spaghetti, a huge platter of the fish caught earlier on and huge bowls of salad all washed down with the family's own wine. Antonia Kindly filleted the fish for those of us who were slightly squeamish about eyes and bones! A platter of fresh fruit finished off the meal before we filed back to the marina at 4pm. At 60 euros per person the day represented great value. We'd book again if we return to Kefalonia.Thank you!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Medden30,September 2019,5,Wonderful experience.,"What a wonderful day we had venturing out on the fishing boat. We stopped and pulled in the nets that had been laid that morning. Whilst our food was being cooked we swam in the ocean near a beautiful secluded beach.  Our food was some of the best I have ever eaten on this island and I have eaten lots of good food here. I tried a scorpion fish that we had caught which was very tasty.  The seafood spegetti was awesome.  Home made cake, wine and food along with the most welcoming family that run the trip. I will definitely recommend this day out and return next year. Tip take a snorkel you see lots of fish."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annablume2014,September 2019,5,Beautiful sail away :),"Antonia and her husband are the most wonderful, heart warming and lovely people you can spend a day on the boat with. We were shown how the fisherman is working daily - collecting the nets , checking the fish and later on throwing it back again in the sea to collect it the next day again!!!! And the best of all , you get to eat the most freshest and delicious fish of your life( for me especially , as I life in a big city far away from the sea).  Antonia is a fantastic cook , so she made sure we were all happy the whole day provided with lots of deliciousness!!! And the whole group was so nice to spend with, getting to know so many different life stories, having a break from your rational brain, relaxing your mind and feeding the soul!!! Thank you Antonia and Michaelis.... you Are the best!!!!"

2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helencC7422OU,September 2019,5,❤❤❤❤❤,"So, 3rd time for us on this wonderful day trip on a working fishing boat. We were welcomed aboard with greek coffee and homemade vanilla cake, Mmmmm.  Then, we set sail at 8am to gather the nets that were set the night before. Magda (hope I've spelt it right) reeled in the nets. We caught copious amounts of varieties of fish which were then cooked for us on board whilst we stopped off in a beautiful bay for a jump off the boat into crystal clear waters. Once back on board we enjoyed a starter of bruschetta then onto the fish feast with a massive pan of freshly cooked spaghetti. We were also given wine (grape juice ) and water whenever we needed. Captain Michalis and Antonia were magnificent hosts as always and couldn't have done anymore for us. Once we had eaten we had time for more swimming then set off back to the harbour for 4pm. All in all it was an amazing day as ever and we are back in june and sept 2020 so we shall be booking again.

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eilisWarwickshire,September 2019,5,Amazing day with fabulous food and great company,We have just arrived back fro a wonderful day with Antonia and Michalis on their boat. There were 12 guests - English Italian and Dutch (with a smattering of Columbian and Sri Lankan).We arrived at the boat to be greeted with authentic Greek coffee and homemade cake and set sail towards Dias. The journey was magical watching the sun rise above the mountain. Our first stop was to start drawing in the nets - 2 kilometres worth although Antonia told us that on a standard fishing trip they haul in 12km! The nets had caught all sorts of fish and a few lobsters. When completed we moved on towards Spartia and dropped anchor at a sheltered cove where we could dive or in my case take the steps into the crystal clear water to swim and snorkel. Time for a snack - freshly made Riganado - all the ingredients from Antonias garden. More swimming and chilling whilst lunch was cooked - the smells were fabulous and the end product by far the best fish I have eaten in 25 years on the island all washed down by a very pleasant home made white wine. It truly was a lovely day excellent value for money and we have come away having made new friends and great memories. Thank you Antonia and Michalis J and M xx
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/romangodzeus,August 2019,4,Unique experience!,We loved our time on Michaelis fishing boat and it was a real experience seeing trawler fishing in action. Once the nets were up we moored in a cove and went snorkelling whilst the crew prepared the fish and lobster they’d caught. The seafood pasta they served was probably the best we had all holiday!
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roving620666,August 2019,5,Amazing Trip ,We found this trip via trip advisor and after reading the amazing reviews we decided to book ourselves. I have 2 sons aged 7 & 11... we began by pulling up the nets dropped that day and it was really fun seeing all the different types of fish that had been caught... Antonia kindly explained to us all the different names & levels of poison which my boys really enjoyed. We then anchored at a beautiful spot with crystal clear water where we could swim & dive from the boat - again an amazing experience. The lobster & fish we caught were being cooked meanwhile then we all sat and ate the most DELICIOUS meal of my entire holiday & the BEST lobster i have ever tasted!! ( I am still dreaming of it now ) we drank some wine and by the end of the trip everyone was the best of friends even tho we didn’t speak the same language as the other guests! The trip was about 5 hours 30 mins and the time flew by..  i was slightly worried my sons would get bored but they didn’t and never moaned once (which is incredible in itself ) all in all I would totally recommend spending time with Antonia & Michalis - if we return to Kefalonia they will be top of our list to visit. 
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/francescamI4734QL,August 2019,5,Amazing experience! ,"The last 24th August, my husband and I joined the fishing tourism ""Michalis"" and it has been one of the best experiences of all our trip to Kefalonia! The team is very nice and efficient! And the captain is also a very good chef! I definitely recommend this experience! "
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mtbury,August 2019,5,A perfect day,"We (a family including 3 boys aged 2, 7 and 8) organised a private trip with Antonia who picked us up from our cruise ship and took us to the small fishing port 20 minutes away. The children were fascinated by the process of hauling in the nets and the lobsters and fish that were collected. We then went to a small secluded beach and swam in the lovely clear water from the boat to the beach where we built sandcastles while Antonia prepared lunch, which was just excellent, up to the standard of anything we had on the cruise ship.The boys had their first experiences of fishing, free swimming in the sea and eating lobster.All in all it was a perfect day, the highlight of a cruise that was in any case wonderful."

3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoetheseasonsvillas,August 2019,5,Highly Recommend,"I can’t say enough about this amazing evening!!! Hands down the best lobster I have ever had in Greece.So, I own a small group of vacation properties on the island. I have always heard amazing reviews of Michali’s Fishing Boat from my guests and decided to give it it a try with a group of friends from the island. I am so happy I did. I highly recommend this to everyone. You will not be disappointed. Andonia and Michalis catered to our every need. Professional courteous and went above and beyond to make our evening cruise memorable. Thank you Andonia and Michalis!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RomaPizza,August 2019,5,Amazing experience ,"We had this wonderful experience with Antonia and Michalis on their fishing boat! Fishing fish, crab and lobsters in the morning, a swim in a crystal water, and an amazing lunch with different courses with lobster cooked on the boat fresh just for us as in the best restaurant. The kids loved it and we will never forget!Extremely recommend. "
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouiseCantrillGodden,August 2019,5,Happy 50th Birthday Little Sister,"I would 100% recommend this trip. The booking was easy to make from England & I was provided with all the necessary information. 11 family & friends arrived at Agia Pelagia for the 17.00 Sunset Trip to a very warm welcome from Antonia who offered Greek coffee & cake.  We set off to collect the catch (which would later appear on our plates) whilst Antonia prepared fabulous bruschetta as an appetiser. We then headed for a quiet bay where we swam, whist our supper was being prepared. Supper was spectacular with freshly homemade veg and salads dishes, the lobster spaghetti was what I had come for and it didn't disappoint. All said it was truly the best lobster they had ever eaten. We ate, drank and laughed the night away until it was time to put the nets back and headed back to  Agia Pelagia, thrilled at our unique outting. A big thank you to Antonia and crew x"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghowie82,August 2019,5,Fantastic Evening!,"My husband had booked this trip a few weeks before arriving in Kefalonia.  Antonia had contacted us the day before our trip to advise that the weather would not be good (windy) therefore the trip would need to be cancelled.  Although we were disappointed this shows that saftey of customers comes first regardless of the loss of income to them.To our delight Antonia had arranged the sunset trip for us instead on another day.  We really appreciated the extra hours her and her team members put in for this trip to go ahead.It was a fantastic experience and my 2 boys (age 7 & 11) absolutely loved it. Snorkeling in the sea and dinner at sunset, beautiful!!Dont be worried if you have fussy eating children, Antonia has this covered, she had asked me if the kids would be ok with the food that was served, so no one will go hungry!I have to say the food served on board was amazing!!! The best meal of my holiday from start to finish, the past was the best I've ever had!!!Highly recommend this trip!!!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anna0831,August 2019,5,Wonderful Day,"My second time, my partner's first. Cannot recommend this experience enough. Remember it's not your ordinary excursion it's a a real fishing boat and that is what you are there to experience, which is what makes it so special. We both agree that we ate the best meal of our holiday on this boat.... Which considering the size of the kitchen is absolutely amazing. Antonia & Mikalis thank so much "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irenedV5934FW,August 2019,5,Great experience,We had a lovely evening at the beginning of August. Mihalis and Antonia was amazing. Ohhhh and the food was delicious!!!The kids reallly enjoyed the diving and the swimming to the secret and private beach!!
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpm241,July 2019,5,Fabulous day out!,"We booked this trip with Antonia before we flew out to Kefalonia. She was very quick at replying and very informative about the day. It starts at 8am from Agia Pelagia in Svoronata with coffee, juice and cake freshly baked by Antonia.The sea had been a bit rough for a day or two, so our original trip date was postponed, but Antonia does a great job of rescheduling the trips so we were able to go the next day. Safety an enjoyment of guests is paramount to Antonia and Michalis.We watched nets for the next evening being cast and then the catch for the day was brought in, mainly the nets are for lobster but we also saw hermit crabs, starfish, red mullet and sea bream. Whilst the nets are cleaned you sail to a beautiful clear beach where you can jump from the boat and swim/snorkel. We had an appetiser of bruschetta and 7 day salt cured tuna, then the main event was lobster, spaghetti, Greek salad, potato salad and home made wine. This was our first experience of lobster (myself and 14 year old son) and it was delicious!This is a working fishing boat trip and several guests were not feeling great when out on the open water. Captain Michalis returned to the port to drop these guests off, then we continued for the day as just a group of 4, me, my son and a lovely Italian couple. It was like a private boat trip! My son said it was the best boat trip he had been on (our 3rd different boat trip in Kefalonia). Thank you Antonia, Michalis and crew for a great day. ️"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/a29nina,August 2019,5,Amazing from the minute we stepped on the boat!!,"This was an absolutely fantastic experience and I highly recommend it to all, couples, families, single travellers.  The owners are so friendly and welcoming.  The views sailing out are amazing! We did the sunset trip.  Watching the fisherman bring the nets in with our catch was so cool! Being able to swim in the waters while Antonia prepared our Greek version of bruschetta with Tuna & chilled white wine, before the main event.  The fish that was caught, cooked to perfection with sides of spaghetti, potato salad & Greek salad and lobsters!! Sharing the food and wine with fellow visitors, couples and families was such a great experience.   Star gazing on the boat and trip back in was out of this world! Such a great trip to take & we will definitely being doing it again the next time we visit the island!!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VickieH338,August 2019,5,Fantastic day out!,"This is a boat trip with a difference, a working fishing boat and you watch them haul the nets in...all 2.5km of them! Antonia was the perfect host, answering all our questions, providing us with homemade cake and coffee on arrival, tasty bruschetta later on, then cooking the catch of the day. So accommodating for us fussy non sea food eaters too with a delicious chicken and sausage casserole! Stopped in a beautiful spot for swimming and snorkelling and endless jumping off the side of the boat and watching them unraveling their catch from the nets was fascinating, we saw loads of different fish, lobsters, spider crabs and star fish! This really is a great day out for all ages! Thank you Antonia, Michalis and crew! Xx"

3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hgjune,July 2019,5,Sunset fishing,Our family (with two boys aged 7 and 10) had a wonderful sunset fishing trip with Antonia and Michalis. This is a unique experience and one of the best things we did in our time on Kefalonia. Antonia made us feel very welcome and provided us with some of the best food we ate during our trip. This is a beautiful fishing boat and a real fishing experience. Highly recommended.

0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karolinep742,July 2019,5,An authentic and amazing Greek boat trip 🇬🇷,"Hello from the Norwegians.My fiancé Sam and I booked this boat trip as our wedding present to one of our favourite friends :) We wanted to book a whole day trip with authentic Greeks and authentic Greek foods and views. And that is exactly what we got!Antonia, Michalis the boat captain were absolutely amazing hosts and company throughout the whole trip! The trip started with the crew picking up the nets of fish. After that the boat travelled quite a distance to get to a quiet location near a beautiful beach with cliffs and a gorgeous view. We got to swim for a long time around the beach and boat, and the water was so warm and delightful. Then we were served beautiful starters (Greek style bruschetta), and after a while we were served a full main meal consisting of lobster, fish, spaghetti, Greek salad, Greek potato mash and beautiful local white wine. Throughout the whole trip the crew made sure we were informed of all the sights and fun local facts about the island. The crew were really good with mingling with us, but also give us some space to eat and space when needed.The married couple could not have been happier and more pleased with the gift, and kept saying throughout the entire trip how amazing the trip was!We could not have been more thankful, amazed and grateful for the trip, and want to thank the crew once again!We definitely recommend this trip highly! One of the most amazing things to do when visiting Kefalonia All the best and greetings from Norway,Karoline, Sam, Marita and Gunnar "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stepharena,July 2019,5,A must-do experience!,"A huge thank you to Antonia, Michelis & crew for a wonderful experience last night! My husband and I were on the 'sunset' trip which commenced at 5pm.Antonia was quick to respond to my enquiry (which was very last minute) and gave us all the necessary information promptly.Shortly after departing on the boat, we were treated to delicious cake. We then watched the crew pull in the nets - it was so interesting to see the whole process and watch how it's done! We then stopped for a swim stop in the most beautiful spot. Antonia made us a beautiful appetizer whilst we waited for dinner. Dinner consisted of a FULL table of deliciousness - fish soup, salads, pasta with octopus, prawns and lobsters! After dinner, we had the sweetest watermelon. The crew were all extremelly welcoming & friendly. Antonia also went out of her way to ensure we got back to our hotel safely at the end of the night. We highly recommend this experience!! It's a little different, fun & the food is amazing! Thanks again!!Stephanie & Martin xx"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseJarrow,July 2019,5,Best day ever,"This was our second trip with Antonia and it was every bit as good as the first. The trip itself is really well organised and because of bad weather we had to reschedule. Antonia kept us fully informed while she rescheduled everyone in trying to make sure everyone could go before the end of there holiday.On the day of the trip we were greeted by Antonia and welcomed on board and coffee and delicious cake is served.We were taken out to sea where we watched nets being cast and then we travelled a little further and watch some nets being brought back. The catch from these nets became our lunch. We then headed to a small bay for a swim in the sea whilst our lunch was cooked.There was plenty of time to relax ,swim and get to know our fellow passengers. Antonia answered any questions we had.The food arrived and to say it was amazing doesn’t do it justice we dined like royalty. I can’t believe so much fantastic food came out of such a small galley. This was a feast not just lunch. If carlsberg did lunches this would be it !!!We then cast some more nets and returned back to the jetty.The day was made extra special by our fellow passengers they were a lovely group even the kids on board were good company especially our new friend Innis !This is a full days trip which I would highly recommend. Antonia and the rest of the crew are very welcoming and more than happy to chat with you and answer any questions you may have. It’s so well organised they make it look easy which I’m sure it’s not. If your looking for a trip that’s a little different then you must try this it’s a brilliant day!!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmaMack78,July 2019,5,A must do whilst in Kefalonia!,"We had been recommended this fishing boat trip by family and it did not disappoint. A fantastic way to spend the day enjoying the sun, amazing views of the beautiful coastline and a lunch that wouldn’t look out of place at a five star seafood restaurant! Great fun watching the nets being brought in to see what’s for lunch but fear not Antonia has a plan B should the nets be sparse. Lobster is guaranteed! Bring towels and snorkels/goggles as whilst lunch is being prepared they set anchor in a cove for some swimming. We will definitely book up again next time we are in Kefalonia. Thank you to Antonia and her husband Michalis & Hassan for a fantastic trip! Emma & Myles"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dodger7569,July 2019,5,Fantastic Day not to be missed,"Our Second trip yesterday, I did ask myself how this can be bettered from last year....But they did and it was just by  keeping it the same.....You are welcomed in such  a way that only Kefalonians know how... From the moment you step onboard you can feel the warmth that everyone truly wants you there and wants you to enjoy the day. I don’t do reviews but felt this certainly needed it and can not recommend high enoughFantastic foodFantastic peopleTreasured MemoriesSee you next year"

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyagar,July 2019,5,Superb fishing day out,"A massive thank you to Captain Michalis, Antonia and Hassan for another wonderful day, This was our 2nd year running we have been on this trip and again we were were not disappointed .Day starts with coffee and cake and followed by a gentle cruise to lay and pick up nets. The fishing was as great as before; followed by a short cruise to a wonderful bay were swimming and snorkelling is a must.Lunch was amazing with Bruschetta and fish soup to start followed by lobster and other sea food all from the earlier catch, all washed down with some local wine.Can’t recommend this trip enough, well worth every single penny."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z133QOjulies,July 2019,5,Fantastic boat trip,"Had a fantastic day today on this boat trip! Amazing scenery, amazing fresh caught and cooked seafood and wonderful hosts who take very good care of us and the other guests. Our 2 boys loved it, especially swimming in the beautiful clear water. Would highly recommend this trip if visiting Kefalonia."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucyjane2700,July 2019,5,Best trip ever!!,"This fishing trip was definitely one of the best excursions I have ever been on and gave me a real insight into the hard work of a fisherman.As soon as you arrive are you greeted kindly by the crew and made to feel extremely welcome. You are provided with freshly made cake and drinks as you make your way to the nets. Once at the nets you are free to walk around the boat and watch the nets come out from the water and get a first look at the daily catch.All food provided on the day is super fresh and organic and definitely some of the most delicious food I have ever tasted. I would 1000% recommend this trip to anybody, one of the best experiences of my life!!!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yclcu,July 2019,5,Excellent fishing trip,"After reading the reviews our expectations were set high and we were not disappointed, great fishing experience with lovely Greek hosts serving the freshest caught fish, lobster and crab for lunch, even our teenage son was impressed. If you want to try something with an intimate setting, would highly recommend this trip. Thank you for a lovely time xx"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miladag2019,July 2019,5,The gem of our vacation,"In general, we are not really fans of group activities, this was however very different. You will get to enjoy a day out on the sea where you will witness how the fish you ate at the restaurants during your vacation in Cephalonia ended up on your plate and you will get to try how the really fresh fish taste. This is all accompanied by a very homey atmosphere, all of us 12 visitors were treated more like very cherished friends than tourists.All in all, you can expect a fun relaxing day with snorkeling, learning something new about fishing, laughter and great food! Is there really anything else to wish for?"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidhD6869TJ,July 2019,5,"Not just any boat trip, this is special.","Okay, so we’ve all been on boat trips haven’t we? You know the score, they take you somewhere for lunch then take you to a beach for a swim then to return to whence you came at the end of the day!This is not just different, it’s spectacularly different.After arriving in the morning to a warm welcome with freshly baked cake and lovely Greek coffee we set sail.After maybe 45 minutes we arrive and proceed to haul in the nets which have already been placed in situ the previous day.What’s in the nets forms the basis of our lunch. Three kilometres of nets later and we have Grouper, an abundance of lobster and various other things. The crew then proceed to prepare a delicious meal of fish soup, lobster, spaghetti cooked in the lobster water, beautiful fresh salad (all organically grown by Antonia) and whilst this is being prepared Antonia gives us some amazing bruschetta to whet our appetite!After diving off the boat into the beautiful sea, eating the fabulous food we then set sail and lay the nets for the next trip.Bloody brilliant!If you only go on one trip make it this one, for €60 it’s a bargain, it’s worth way more than that for the lobster alone.Thank you Antonia and Michalis, it was a pleasure to meet you and spend a day on your boat.It was interesting, fun and most of all delicious!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zdvarko,July 2019,5,A wonderful expeience,"While our visit was not purely for pleasure, and was oriented more towards familiarising ourselves with the fishing tourism practices in Kefalonia, it still managed to provide a wonderful field trip, where we got to experience everything Michalis, Antonia and Hassan normally offer to tourists. Tourists normally visiting fishing villages and similar places generally don't have the opportunity to see fishing gear in actual operation, so the chance to first-hand experience lifting and setting of gillnets onboard the vessel, and see the daily catch lifted directly from the sea really provides a great experience. This is only improved with the delicious lunch offered on board, prepared straight from the net.All in all, I can only readily recommend this experience to anyone interested in artisanal fishery experience combined with a quality meal."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trisherfisher,July 2019,5,Wonderful day at sea!,"We had the most amazing experience a week ago on this little fishing trawler! We were welcomed by Antonia who is the very talented cook of the trip, who was also very informative re wildlife and fishing and beautiful Kefalonia. The nets were hauled in along with plenty of fish and lobster for our delicious lunch! Swimming off the boat in a tiny secluded bay whilst we waited for lunch to be cooked........We would say better than any restaurant fare, it was a true feast a la mer! Then to set the 3km nets again for tomorrows carch before heading home. Such a welcoming, relaxing, genuine  and fascinating experience.....stuff of great memories...thankyou all for a super super day to remember!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helbel63,July 2019,5,Day Trip on working fishing boat,"A lovely day trip on a working fishing boat with this hardworking family.  On arrival we had cake and Greek coffee.  Lunch was salads, lobster, soup, spaghetti and bruschetta for appetisers.  Water, wine and juice included.  Stopped off in a little beach alcove for lunch after collecting the nets with our catch for lunch.  Whilst food is prepped you are free to swim from the boat and to shore.  Generous portions and delicious.  Dessert was watermelon and lemon cake although I think they usually only serve fruit.  Everything is freshly caught and grown in their garden.  Wine and olive oil is also made by them.  We drove from Poros, 50 min drive then another 25 mins to port which is not well sign posted from the main road.  We did a recce the day before as it is an early start 8am. Boat takes 12 so no crowds or loud party music.  Antonia is wknowledgeable and quite a character. Photos below of our lunch and location.  Note they collect and drop fishing nets which takes some time but part of the experience.  We returned to Port at 430."

A big thank you to all who made our day very memorable."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/736PaulR,July 2019,5,A real fishing boat experience,"Fishing trips can take many forms. This one is a 22 year old wooden fishing boat that is operating as it always has. The difference is that a few of us can watch it in action, see the days catch - various fish, lobster, crabs etc plus some interest for the children with starfish and sea urchins. While we swim in a secluded bay the crew produce a wonderful combination of appetisers, soups and pasta dishes made from the days catch and washed down with some local and very palatable wine. Great day. Swimming gear a must, snorkelling gear if you use it, but I would also recommend something a little softer to sit on during the trip. The experience is well worth it."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaH2580,July 2019,5,The best day out!,"From the moment you arrive, Antonia & the crew make you feel like friends.Greek coffee & cake are served & then you set sail to the fishing nets.We had a bumper catch of lobster & grouper. If you choose to you can help clean the nets.Then you can swim off the boat whilst lunch is prepared on board. Everything is super fresh. The veggies, olive oil, wine are all produced by the family. We loved every minute. Thank you again Antonia- you're a star ️"

Antonia, Michalis, and Hassan are such warm people and we felt like family. We enjoyed watching the nets being brought in and learned that Hassan had made them.He also explained the sea life caught in the nets which was very interesting. Swimming was great. We LOVED the food...all homemade with local products of which most were from Antonia’s garden. What  an authentic day. Also want to say Antonia answered my messages quickly. Michalis and Antonia were waiting for us when we got off the ship and we  returned to the ship at our prearranged time.Relax, Enjoy and Eat. It doesn’t get better. Thank you for the memories."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PragueCourtyard,June 2019,5,Norwegian Star to Fishing Boat,"Unfortunately our time here was limited because of the cruise itinerary.  Regardless this was a great adventure. We are a family of 4, Antonia was a great host. She was waiting for us as our ship docked and did a great job communicating back and forth with us. This trip is a hidden gem. When we arrived, we were treated with Greek coffee, cake, and sweet bread. 45 minutes later we were jumping off the boat, taking videos, and then swimming to XI beach. Next we enjoyed a delicious FEAST. Homemade white wine, bruschetta, lobster, spaghetti, Greek salad, and the best potato salad ever. Antonia my wife wants that potato salad recipe. Look if you want to get off the beaten path, I would highly recommend this. Great husband and wife host and their friend is a great chief. We really enjoyed this and my college kids loved this too."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Runninggirl27,June 2019,3,Good but could been better.... ,"I feel I have to be honest on my review and looking at the previous 5* reviews unfortunately I don’t agree. Firstly it was great to be aboard a fishing boat seeing how the nets work and then to see the catch of day. Coming from a farmers background this was something we were interested in - seeing where our food came from. We caught lots of lobster and I believe ray. The food on board was lovely and freshly prepared. However we felt that we had to eat the lobster, this was caught that morning on the boat however me and my partner had no intention of eating the lobster. (I know some people may think we were being fussy but this is the only food we’re not keen on - were also weren’t the only ones) and would have declined knowing that all the lobster was being cooked. We would have tried but felt pressured into all the lobster being eaten which then pushed us further into saying no thank you. We enjoyed the bruschetta (best I’ve ever had) and the spaghetti and soup. There is a lot of food provided. Also we did stop for a little swim while lunch was being prepared however just be aware that the boat doesn’t stop on a beach as mentioned in our itinerary. Instead stopping near cliffs. If you not keen on deep water (me) then a life jacket is provided. However I know some people prefer to wade in the water and feel that this is important for people to know. My partner enjoyed his swim. We weren’t sure on rough timings so wasn’t too sure how long we had in the water - we had a long time (2+hours which was a little too long for us). Overall this is a lovely boat trip if you would like to see how the fishing world works. However for us we felt it was a little too long and at times felt we had done wrong by not eating the lobster. Perhaps state to the crew that this isn’t something you want to eat so they can accommodate you. It would have been nice to have been introduced to the crew too. It was nice to see a different part of the island and to be aboard a fishing boat eating freshly cooked food. "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenstewart108,June 2019,5,an absolutely perfect day,"we decided to opt for this boat trip after reading great reviews about it, and it didn't disappoint. Antonia is a lovely lady and we were made so welcome from the moment we stepped onto the boat.imagine watching your lunch being caught, and holding the catch (if you choose to) to seeing it being prepared and cooked for you.and better still, we were able to swim when the lunch was cooking.desert was fresh fruit from Antonias gardens, and the wine was home made by her father-in-law.I have done many boat trips in many different countries and have to say this is my favourite trip by far.we will be seeing Antonia and crew next year for sure!"

Your culinary delights were exceptional which overwhelmed all desire for fishing, your food quality was outstanding, you provided a spectacular day with glorious food and exceptional people thank you for making a mark in our holiday"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissChef03,June 2019,5,Perfect Fishing Day!,"I couldn’t think of a better way to spend a day on the water when visiting Kefalonia. My family stayed in Argostoli, so it was a short 18 min drive to the dock where the boat is. We brought our 4 year old and he had the best time. The food is absolutely incredible and seasoned to perfection. Upon arrival we enjoyed piping hot Greek coffee and spectacular homemade cake made by Antonia the Captains wife. We headed out to see to retrieve the nets (took about 45 min more or less to get there) then the crew reales in the days catch. For us it was scorpion fish and lobsters. We also caught in the nets a piece of tile from a famous shipwreck from over a hundred years ago...very cool. We then headed out a little further to drop anchor in crystal blue waters where the crew prepared the food while we took a dip in the ocean. For starters we enjoyed the Greek style bruschetta and salt cured tuna, followed by scorpion fish soup, lobster spaghetti and watermelon. There is also a plentiful amount of homemade white wine offered. I can’t say enough about the friendly crew. They were informative, helpful, friendly and best of all AMAZING cooks! The way to my heart for sure! They also provided a life jacket for my son and asked a day before if they needed to prepare any special food for him. He also got to wear the captains hat. It’s those details that prove they are top notch. I really feel like a have created a life long friendship with them. This is a must do excursion on your trip to Kefalonia."

Supplied with coffee and cake served by the fabulous fisherman Hassan while the rest of our fellow shipmates arrived. Just 12 of us which meant getting to know one another whilst sailing out to haul the catch. What a lovely group of people. Hassan had willing helpers (bit of a boy thing!)  to extract the lobster etc from the nets as we sailed to a lovely cove for a swim/rest. All followed by an amazing banquet of bruschetta Greek style, ingredients from Antonia's garden, Michalis's cured tuna and THEN a wonderful fish soup and the best lobster spaghetti EVER from the catch all cooked on board by Michalis and Antonia. The wine courtesy of Michalis father flowed along with the conversation/repartee. Antonia had explained the lobster fishing process over the day and answered questions in an unassuming way and was the perfect hostess. She engulfed us all in a warm embrace to send us on our way when we arrived back at the marina. And that pretty much sums up how this trip felt from beginning to end. What a marvellous day and memory of Kefalonia."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judithmS3781EE,June 2019,5,Day Fishing trip,"Four of us are just back from a fantastic trip with Antonia and Michalis, their daughter Nicki and Hassan (I’m not sure how you spell his name ).  What a first class day from booking on the Web, Antonia got back to me so promptly it was unbelievable, to getting back to the harbour at the end of the day.  I don’t know where to start, they make you feel part of their family from the moment you step on board their lovely traditional fishing boat.  The day started with coffee and cake whilst leaving the harbour on our way to picking up the nets.  They caught Lobster and Sea Bream which was all prepared for a magnificent  lunch, it was the best food we have had whilst in Kephalonia.  If you do nothing else whilst there then this day is a must and we wouldn’t hesitate to join them again and in fact can’t wait to book again.I can’t think of anything negative to say, it was just a glorious day with people who made you feel like family."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariaD693,June 2019,5,If you do nothing else in Kefalonia go on this trip!,"Probably the best organised trip I have ever done on any holiday! I felt like they shared a secret bit of Kefalonia with us. The hosting was great, the food superb and to see how proper fisherman fish was fantastic. All in all a magical day and we will be recommending it to everyone. Thank you Antonia, Nikki and family xx (and the lobster was to die for)"

0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badsaboy,June 2019,5,Absolutely perfect,"Booked after reading all the TA reviews. As soon as we got onboard we could tell that we were in good hands. Coffee and freshly baked cake to start the morning was amazing. We traveled out to the fishing nets laid out before and watched Antonio and Hassan work together to bring them in. Soon enough we were rewarded with a large lobster closely followed by its smaller siblings. With enough lobster and fish to feed the boat we headed for a little secluded bay where lunch was prepared for us. The new found crew got on like a house on fire and we enjoyed each other’s company tremendously. We chatted while lunch was prepared and soon enough plans were being made to continue the day when we got back to shore. Lunch was amazing. A beautiful fish soup full of flavour was our first course. Second course was a table full of fresh salad, spaghetti and of course the prized catch of the day - the lobster. Fresh sweet melon to top it all off we were stuffed. After lunch and another swim we headed back to the port and said our good-byes to our hosts Antonio, Michalis and Hassan. We had a great day and learnt a great deal but the highlight was that we felt like family from the very first minute we met them. We all came together and had the best possible day which continued at our new crew mates hotel pool not far from the port. The conversation was dominated by the days events which is a testament to Antonia, Michalis Hassan and all those we met onboard. Awesome awesome awesome day. Thank you."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Littlegem91,June 2019,5,Highlight of the holiday (and we did a lot!),"We couldn't rate the Michalis high enough! We were so happy to experience this with them. From start to finish they made us feel right at home. I've been speaking to Antonia two months prior to coming out. And not once she was pushy to book the trip as I am really untrusting with excursions due to the fact it was fishing and my partner can't eat lobster and neither can I due to allergies also I'm gluten free! Antonia went to great trouble to get me Gluten Free Bread for Appetisers (which was incredible!) and gluten free biscuits so I didn't miss out on morning coffee. Her husband also cooked me and my partner the most delicious Chicken dish, with gorgeous potato salad and tomato salad to accompany whilst the rest of the boat ate their caught lobster and spaghetti which looked absolutely incredible!! The whole experience from catching the fish in the nets through to swimming in the clearest of waters, drinking Robola Wine and laughing until our bellies hurt was just amazing. We toured the whole island yet this is honestly the best trip we've been on! 60 Euros to include all of that and the highest quality lobster worth 60-120 euro per kg and these were over a kilo! Value for money is absolutely unbelievable and such a beautiful family. I will continue to keep in touch with Antonia and cannot wait to come back next year and do it all again! Thank you so much all! Xxx"

Antonia is a great host and together with Michalis and his right hand man Hassan you honestly could not wish for a better day.This is not a boat full of tourists getting sunburnt and singing, this is being with a real fisherman, family and friends, enjoying a great day out, with GREAT food, good wine and good company.Honestly, highly recommended!Thank you"

4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tacklentravel,May 2019,5,Dreams do come true,"Antonia and Michalis' and crew were absolutely wonderful.  First, we were welcomed with huge smiles and warm embraces by Antonia who also baked us a fresh breakfast Vanilla cake (yum).  We were then enroute to go take up the nets that they put out the night prior.  In my inexperience, I began to get a little nervous about going further out to sea than I had anticipated.  Antonia immediately saw my change in demeanor and asked if I would feel better if we anchored at a nearby island instead of collecting the nets.  I jumped at that new option.  My husband was able to fish while my kids swam at the shallow end of the lagoon and I was able to just relax.  Antonia and Michalis created a splendid spread of Lobster, Noodles, Potatoe Salad, Greek Salad and fresh fruit salad for dessert.  Many of the ingredients came right from her own farm!  They went out of their way to make sure that we enjoyed our excursion even though I was being a scaddie-cat.  Lastly, I am a disabled traveler.  They were very professional and accommodating towards me although I had a mobility challenge.  They got me on and off their boat with no problems!   I would recommend them 100% for an unforgettable Kefalonia experience."

3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pedmaz,May 2019,5,An absolutely perfect day,"This trip was the highlight of our two week stay in Kefalonia. There aren't enough words to describe our day with Captain Michalis, Antonia, Hassan and little Nikki, so we recommend you experience it for yourselves. Early on a beautiful clear morning we were warmly welcomed on board with delicious coffee and homemade cake while we sailed off across a turquoise sea to the nets, which had been cast the night before. It was breeding season for the dolphins so they had plundered all the fish rather than hunt for their own, but we didn't mind and we just sailed to the next nets. We watched Hassan bring in the nets with lobsters, spider crabs, squid, octopus and all kinds of fish, some of which we'd never seen before. The fish was prepared and cooked while we sailed to a beautiful, shallow cove, where you could swim or laze about on board, whatever you wished. Then a  feast fit for a king was served to us along with Greek salad, potatoes, fresh bread and a choice of chilled wine or soft drinks. There was enough to feed an army and all 12 of us made the most of it. Late afternoon we sailed back to the little port all agreeing what a fabulous day it had been and that it was worth every euro. Thank you again Michalis, Antonia, Hassan and little Nikki for an amazing experience.  We look forward to sailing with you again, hopefully in September.  Marie & Pete.  XXX"

2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92dominikb,May 2019,5,Great Daytrip with awesome Seafood,Great Daytrip with Captain Michalis and his wife Antonia. The group of 12 guests started at 08 hrs in the morning with fresh coffee and cake. After picking up the nets the catch is papared on board! The food was really good and Antonia was a great host.
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Helste,May 2019,5,Another great day,"This was our second trip with Antonia & Mixalis after enjoying our first trip so much.As it was early May the weather was unpredictable and our original trip had to be cancelled due to bad weather. However Antonia made sure we were re-booked in and had our trip. They will not travel if they think their customers will not enjoy the experience.We were provided with cheese pie and Greek coffee before we set sail at 8am.We set sail to the nets that were laid the previous night and then watched as they landed a great variety of sea life.Once the nets were hauled in we sailed to a beautiful secluded area where we stopped for a relax and if brave enough a swim (the sea is still cold at the moment, but some brave souls did go in)While we relax, Antonia and Mixalis cook the fish they have just caught, along with salad, potatoes and their own wine.The food is plentiful, you won't go hungry and delicious.After a leisurely lunch and relax, they then return you to the harbour, with a full stomach and beautiful new made friends.We had such a lovely day with Antonia, Mixalis and the other guests and can not wait to return in September for our third trip.If you are looking for something a little different and also great for kids, give this trip a try."

We had homemade cake,and Greek seafood cooked straight from the sea. Best Fisherman's spaghetti I have ever tasted. Would highly recommend. Lots of laughter. A day we will never forget.

0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helencC7422OU,May 2019,5,A trip not to be missed!!!,"Well where do I start, this was our 2nd trip on this working fishing boat trip. We were greeted by Antonia who is the most wonderful host offering home made cake and greek coffee before we set off. Michalis takes the helm and off we go. We go to collect the nets that had been set the night before and Hassan works tirelessly bringing then in whilst we watch in wonder at what has been caught; lobsters, barrachudas, stingray (that went back to the sea), numerous varieties of fish (obviously ) then a beautiful meal was prepared by Antonia and lobster spaghetti by Michalis with plenty of 'grape' juice galore (that's white wine btw). We anchored in a lovely little bay whilst we ate and drank. Swimming and jumping off the boat whilst anchored is a must do but the sea was a tad chilly at this time of year but a couple of guests did partake. This is a trip that must be booked and not to be missed - highly recommended. Ps don't have breakfast beforehand you won't need it! We have already booked our 3rd trip for Sept so roll on 16 weeks. THANK YOU Antonia, Michalis and Hassan for another day of creating fantastic memories. Love to you all. Until Sept..... ️️"

See you all in September for our third trip , we are already looking forward to it. "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IlonaV277,May 2019,5,Do it!,"Higly recommend! The food to die for. Seriously I have never eaten more delicious seafoon. A very relaxing atmosphere on a boat.  Fun for kids and adults! You can swim, help with unneting the fish or whatever. Amazing views and very hospitable and helpful hosts! Will do it again! Thank you so much️"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/705santas,April 2019,5,"Fantastic Food, Experience and People!","Firstly, this is possibly the best excursion we have been on while travelling around Europe. Having never been on a fishing boat before we didn't know what to expect but from the moment we booked through to the end of the trip we were looked after extremely well by Antonia. Antonia ensured our arrival to the boat was handled and even picked us up from our hotel. Heading out in the early morning was made much more manageable by the delicious home baked cake and coffee on arrival. As the trip progressed Antonia educated us on the profession of fishing and each stage of the process as the nets were reeled in and the fish collected. We then moored up in a beautiful bay near the south of the island with a glass of wine from the family vineyard and the chance to swim in the bay. The water was so clear and fresh with no one else in sight. Over the next hour or so smells started to stir from the kitchen as the best meal we had in Greece was produced. Nothing beats direct from the sea and into the pan! We all sat down to eat together and I have to say the food was some of the best I have ever had. Every ingredient was locally produced by various members of the family and the tastes were sensational. Overall I would highly recommend this experience to anyone who wants to board an elegant boat, head out to sea and experience the highs of having your dinner caught and cooked for you."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robthecod,October 2018,5,Fishing fantastico!,"Best day of the two weeks holiday. Traditional fishing with a local family. Made to feel part of the whole experience. A MUST for any keen fishermen. Pulled up on a lovely beach, ate what we caught and swam from the boat. Maximum of 12 people so totally authentic. Lovely people on board and the hosts were amazing. Almost forgot to mention the wine and dancing. Thanks to you from Rob and Lisa xxx"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ltwn123,October 2018,5,Not your average boat trip,"Well, what can I say. Antonia and Michalis make you feel so welcome. From the moment you board the whole experience is a pleasure. Coffee and cake followed by a trip to bring in the 3km of nets. You are free to get as involved as you like and then there is time to swim, fish & enjoy the sun whilst Antonia serves up bruschetta and home made wine. Then after more sun and free time the largest freshest feast appears before your eyes. We met some fabulous people on board and it was the highlight of our holiday. Not your average boat trip, I can highly recommend. Many thanks Antonia and Michalis - we loved it."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scenic751164,September 2018,5,"Fish, swim, eat, drink, laugh.","What an amazing day. Watch 3 km of fishing net, set the night before, brought in. From olive oil from Antonia’s olive grove, to fresh tomatoes, to fresh caught and cooked fish, this is an experience not to be missed."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/575garyn,September 2018,5,"Fish, swim , eat , drink laugh ","I have been looking forward to this trip since June and it lived up to everything and more , Antonio was so good on communication no matter when , being a keen fisherman it was fascinating to see all the different species bought in , we all got stuck in getting the fish out as soon as possible ready for michalis to cook , anchored in a pretty cove and basically chilled until lunch was made , lobster , fish , pasta salads etc all washed down with homemade wine .. antonio was so welcoming and in no time the 10 on board were chatting like old friends .. fantastic day will return 100% next time in kefalonia , thank you again . Gary and Amanda "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twistybird,September 2018,5,Fantastic day,"Antonia greets you with a huge smile, coffee and home made cake! No better start to the trip. Small groups of up to 12 on a traditional wooden Greek fishing boat. Helping to reel in the catch and seeing all different varieties of fish which are then expertly cooked up for lunch by Michalis while Antonia supplies quantities of Greek grape juice... Moored in a beautiful cove, you can swim off the boat or just relax in the sun. A great day and I would recommend it to anyone."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Experience798133,September 2018,5,Brilliant trip!,"Amazing day! Friendly, knowledgable hosts who were infinitely patient with small children and curious adults alike. Genuine experience of the Greek way of fishing, with the added bonus of eating the catch. All the food was exceptional - from the cake, to the lobster, the fish and the spaghetti. Plenty of time to laze around the boat, swim, and explore quiet beaches. Would recommend this as the best day out, and definitely the best place to eat in Kefalonia. Bravo Antonia!!!!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coologine,September 2018,5,Amazing trip! Would recommend to a friend.. or you!,"Lovely people and lovely food! It was definitely a must, 10/10 Experience, would definitely do again! Never really had seafood before, I’m so glad I gave this a go!!"

3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkb63,September 2018,5,Fabulous!!!!!!!,"One of the highlights of our holiday, the boat trip was not a tourist trap, it was really interesting, and fun full day, Antonia is a fantastic host, she is fun, and a little naughty , if you want an insight into a traditional fisherman’s day, this is a must."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grimesters,September 2018,5,Wonderful Day with Beautiful People,"We had a wonderful day on this working fishing boat and are so glad we choose this over a ' normal boat trip 'My husband and our 2 friends were greeted with Greek coffee and homemade cake by Antonia and made to feel very very welcome, it was one of the best day's of holiday, we watched as Hassan brought the nets in full of all different types of fish, the food we ate was beautiful  cooked by Michalis and Hassan  fresh fish , fresh salads , Octopus spaghetti , potato salad,and more, Antonia even made me a seperate batch of one of the dishes as i am allergic to red wine , we had lots of time for swimming also , Antonia, Michalis, Hassan and Nikki thank you for once again you are such beautiful people and Antonia you are so funny I loved your sense of humour, we will be back next year and are already looking forward to another trip with you all."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Helste,September 2018,5,Fabulous Fishing Trip,"We booked this trip after reading many reviews. We met at 8.00am and boarded the boat.Once we had set sail we were served cake and coffee, which was very nice and a good start to the day.We then travelled to where they had laid their nets the previous night and they started to bring the nets in. Apparently there was 3km of nets that they hauled in.We sat and watched a whole variety of sea life being landed, which was fascinating.Once the nets had been hauled in and all the fish landed, we travelled to a small beach which can only be reached by water. We anchored up and spent time swimming in the sea and relaxing on the beach, while Antonia & Michalis prepared and cooked the fish they had just cooked.The food was served up with wine and was delicious. You can't get fresher!There was then time for another swim if you wanted, before setting back off to the port and home.It was a great day spent with an absolutely gorgeous, friendly family who work so hard to make this a special day.Would definitely recommend this trip if visiting Kefalonia.  "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammig30,September 2018,5,Fabulous day at sea,"I am so glad I chose this trip over a normal sunbed filled, packed to the rafters boat trip. Antonia is the loveliest host and greeted me like we had met before. I felt so at ease straight away. The group of people we had on board were so nice and considering language was not easy. This was because I don't speak Russian or Italian, nor Greek for that matter but we all seemed to try and converse. Watching the nets get brought in by hand and all the fishes plus an octopus was so cool and interesting. Watching Mihales tenderize the octopus was fun, beating the life out of it basically but then when eaten was fantastic. The lunch that was prepared for us considering the limited facilities was amazing. The wine was very sweet and lovely to drink. I will definitely do this trip again because I know each time will be different. Thank you to you all, Antonia, Mihales and Hassan. Loved it. Samantha xx"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helencC7422OU,September 2018,5,a truly unforgettable day,"2nd review as 1st one lost!My husband and 2 friends had the pleasure of going on this trip on Mon 3rd Sept. Antonia and Michalis were fabulous hosts from the moment we stepped on board and I hold a lot of memories from this day. We had a lot of laughs with the other guests and also when I took a 'dive' 1 intentional and the other not so intentional  but the memories will last a lifetime. I loved splashing about in the water with Niki who is an absolute credit to you both. This is a trip on a working fishing boat and Antonia & Michalis prepped some of the days' catch reeled in on 3km of net by Hassain, for a lovely feast. We stopped off for a swim in the crystal waters whilst food was prepped. I would highly recommend this trip.  to you all and THANK YOU again for the memories. Will definitely visit again when we return to Svoronata. love Helen and Steve Clayton xx "

A chance to snorkel and swim in the clearest sea. Antonia and her family are brilliant at what they do. Cant wait to do this trip next year."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/684dani_lleb,September 2018,5,Fishing with Michalis,"One of the most memorable days of our holiday in Kefalonia. Antonia and the crew welcomed us with some greek coffee (not our thing) and some delicious cake. They then took us to their nets and showed us the hard work of a fisherman. After a swim in the sea, they treated us with a great seafood lunch (2 kinds of lobster, seafood spaghetti, 2 kinds of salad and 7 different fishes). Delicious!P.S. Book a day without Italian people (kidding of course, had a great day with Gabrio and the rest)!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/542phaedral,September 2018,5,The original Greek fishing experience,"It was a totally unique experience!! We saw a greek traditional way of fishing, we swam in the crystal waters of Kefalonia and we ate a delicious lunch that was consisted by fish we caught, about an hour before. Captain Michalis cooked the best spaghetti I had in my whole life, with the ""secret ingredient"" the fresh fish, of course. Also, he fried so many tasty fish, as you can see in the pictures. Furthermore, I'm incapable of finding the right words to describe his wife, Antonia, a very communicative person with excellent knowledge of English language, who taught us a lot about Kefalonia and fishing in general and made us laugh a lot too. Last but not least, their daughter Nicky who will keep the best possible company to the children of the family and she's adorable!! It's a completely amazing experience and the day we joined them was the best day at Kefalonia!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/951naomih,September 2018,5,Fantastic day out,"Just come back from a fantastic day out. Felt like a real family affair....Antonia was such a great host with a good sense of humour & very informative. Fascinating watching Cassan (probably spelt that wrong....sorry) bringing in the nets. We stopped by a lovely secluded beach where we could swim & snorkel whilst Cassan, Antonia & Michalis prepared our dinner, which was delicious....can't get any fresher. Thank you to you all for making it a day to remember & hugs to Nikki who was adorable.....tell her to remember the stones! "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoer367,August 2018,5,Great day out,This was a unique experience......collecting the nets and seeing all the different types of fish including lobster and stingrays.Lots of information given about the catch and area.Antonia was such a pleasure to be around and so helpful- food was fantastic.Thank you all for a lovely time.Zoe x
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PortsmouthCaro,August 2018,5,Fantastic day trip,Highlight of our holiday. Day out on a fishing boat. Watched the nets being drawn in. The lobster and fish were then cooked on the boat for our lunch. Can't get any fresher than that ! Had nice length of time to swim off the boat to an isolated beach to work up an appetite. Wonderful home cooking. Small group of about ten in total. Really very friendly family. Highly recommended.

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianf911,September 2018,5,Surely the best way to spend your final day on Kefalonia,"After spending lots of time emailing with Antonia we finally got the booking we wanted on our last day. I had wanted to go on this trip well before our holiday but it took a while to convince everyone.We all had a great time starting with the orange cake through to the very drinkable wine. We cannot recommend this trip high enough. We finished the day tired, sun kissed and full of lobster what's not to like.Thank you to Antonia and co lots for the success of the day you are offering a great experience.I nearly forgot to add we also had the best meal we had on Kefalonia though the best part of the meal still ranges between the lobster, the spaghetti or the tomato salad but that is a family discussion."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SWFUk,August 2018,4,"Well this was different.,,","We travelled on this trip at 5pm....yesterday.....I think if you are looking for a fishing trip then you need to do the morning trip!! Saying that ...it was great the kids could see the putting out of 6km of nets!! Ready for the mornings trip catch....It seemed a long labourious task that Captain Mihalis and Hassan  did with ease. It made us laugh as there were lots of seaweed relics in the nets. The whole trip was made a lot more bearable by three very lovely ladies that joined us on this trip, and they thankfully  supervised the children when they went for a swim from the boat...unfortunately my husband and I due to arthritis could not manage to get out of the boat to swim, neither can my daughter who has injuries to her foot. The children both age 9 swam beautifully from the boat and back  to the boat.  Finally Antonia cooked the most beautiful meal ever.... the lobster was massive and plentiful salads were gorgeous and I don’t know the name of the bread with tomatoes cucumbers and everything else traditional Greek dish was fabulous.  Antonia even provided the children with spaghetti some plain as we have a very fussy eater! All washed down by what Antonia called Grape juice ! It was lovely we all enjoyed ourselves..... thank you all very very much ...we got back to the port around 10 o’clock and the kids were exhausted and fell asleep,n the way back in the car "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/386katherinas,July 2018,5,This was the highlight of our trip,"We travel to Kefalonia yearly.  This time we were hosting family from New York and wanted to do something different. Captain Mihalis, Antonia, and Hassan made this outing the highlight of our trip.  We enjoyed swimming while they prepared an amazing meal from the catch of the day.  This is what it's all about: family, food, and amazing memories.I highly recommend booking this trip."

0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fleaflyflo,August 2018,5,Best day of our holiday!,"Spending a holiday in Svoronata we looked into the boat trip here and emailed to pre-book-it was the best decision of our holiday! The most welcoming of hosts, superb company and gorgeous food together with swimming off the boat made this an idyllic day. This trip was worth every penny and if we’d had time we would have gone again the next day. During our trip our hosts were disappointed by the size of the day’s catch and seemed genuinely upset that they would be letting us down. Nothing could be further from the truth, the food cooked by Antonia and wine were plentiful and delicious. I cannot recommend this trip more highly, thank you all for a truly memorable day Lisa, Andy and Emma"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cow182,August 2018,5,Michalis fishing boat trip! ,"What an amazing day! So much more interesting than the usual boat trips, I would highly recommend. We were served with coffee and delicious home made cake whilst we made our way out to the nets. Everyone had such fun watching the nets come in with all sorts of creatures including some massive lobster! A real fascinating insight into the daily life of a real fishing boat. After bringing in the catch we swam in the sea whilst an amazing meal was cooked for us. Delicious lobster, bruschetta, spaghetti and he best potato salad I’ve ever tasted.Our hosts were fantastic, friendly, informative and great cooks! Thank you so much and hope to see you in the future! Good luck with swordfish season! Nick, April & Zac!"

Some of the others had done this before and said it was the best day of their holiday - well I can see why. Felt very welcome from the start. Lovely cake and coffee to welcome us on board. A day of relaxing and amazing food cooked fresh from their catch with swimming and snorkeling off a lovely beach thrown in along with some lovely wine. Could not recommend this day enough

Thanks again to you all we had a fantastic time."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StampingthePassport,August 2018,5,What a Day!,"Mixalis, Antonia and their lovely daughter Nikki were the best hosts. Not only did we have so much fun eating and swimming in the best places that Kefalonia offers, but we learnt so much - from the Greek language all the way to species of fish and how to cook them perfectly. You feel like one big happy family by the end of the trip and it is the perfect way to see a different side of Kefalonia and of Greece. Fishing is such an important part of life in this part of the world and why not experience it with the best. Thank you Fishing Tourism Kefalonia 'Michalis' for letting us share a fantastic day with us."

The day started with an amazing slice of cake cooked by herself and continued with a lot of great food and mostly important with a lot of fun! The company was great, we enjoyed the day so much from the first minute to the last.The beach we saw was incredible, we dived and swam all day. And lastly, I’m Italian and I can tell that the spaghetti that Michaelis and Antonia Made were simply PERFECT. Most beautiful day in Cefalonia.Thank you thank you thank you! "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/798tabitas,August 2018,5,Great time with great people in Kefalonia,"We just got back from our trip to Kefalonia,  where we had a wonderful time. We spent our last day in the island on the boat with Antonia and Michalis. We also got to know some very friendly Italians who happened to be our companions on the trip that day. It was a wonderful day. Not only did we enjoy a great, relaxing time and absolutely delicious, fresh food cooked on the boat, but we also got to see how much hardwork the profession of a fisherman implies. Also, Antonia was extremely kind and she even offered to give us a ride from and back to our accommodations, as we had to give our rented car back a day before the trip. We thank you for the beautiful day you gave us, Antonia and Michalis! Very recommended! "
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Afoz,July 2018,5,Fantastic Day out ! ,"We took the fishing tour with our two children (11 and 13) it was an early start. Antonio very kindly picked us up at 7.40 as we were in Svoronata. The day started with drinks and sailing out to put out the nets and to bring in the nets for the days catch. We couldn’t believe our eyes - huge crabs, lobster, star fish and a scorpion fish. We stopped at Pessada Beach to swim, which was just beautiful whilst Antonio and Michaelis made lunch with the fresh catch. We ate salad, potato salad, lobsters, crab and lobster spaghetti. It was the best food I’d tasted. It was a brilliant day - I’d definitely recommend it to anyone coming to visit Kefalonia! "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sparksy171,July 2018,1,The trip that never was,"I arranged a trip while in uk when we got there was told they was not going out so we rebooked and then was told the day before there was going to be bad weather,let me just say I am a seasoned fisherman from Grimsby,and the weather was perfect hardly any wind i just think they overbooked people which is a shame because I was really looking forward to this trip."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timmythesheep,August 2018,5,Fantastic evening trip,"We spent a wonderful late afternoon and evening with Antonia and the crew of Michalis. Heading out of the harbour, east along the coastline we enjoyed the fresh breeze and the beautiful views of the mountains. Having placed their lobster nets, we then sailed to Spartia beach and had some time to swim in the clear turquoise sea while Antonia prepared dinner. What a treat- succulent fresh lobster, spaghetti and salads served with delicious local wine. Having stuffed ourselves silly, we enjoyed a beautiful sunset as we sailed back home. A fabulous experience that I would recommend. Antonia is a kind and helpful hostess, who made us very very welcome and cared for. I would recommend+++"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Just_me76,July 2018,5,Amazing day trip,"What a fantastic day we had! Started in Agia Pelagia around 8am, coffee and fresh home baked cake soon after leaving the port, then set the new net and went to pick up the already set one which had quite a few lobsters! Set off to Pessada where we stopped for a swim while Antonia and her husband were preparing the fresh catch. We had an amazing meal and left around 15:30.Antonia and her husband are lovely and very knowledgeable about fishing and the area. Their fishing is environmentally friendly, all the small catch is thrown back and they don't fish more than they need.A lovely day with a lovely family, certainly the highlight of our holiday!"

Our hosts were very nice and welcomed us on board serving delicious food throughout the day and showing us a fisherman’s typical working day. From casting the nets to bringing in the catch it’s fascinating. Then a stop off to swim in the sea whilst our catch was cooked. Can’t recommend this enough we will certainly be back next year. Thank you Antonia you have helped us create some lovely memories!

2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/798williamr,July 2018,5,The best fishing trip ever,"My friends Alina & Debbie booked this trip as a surprise for me. Boy, what a surprise.  We arrived at the quay at 8am to very warm reception.  We boarded almost immediately and were served Greek coffee and home made sponge cake, delicious. Once all the guests, I think they have a maximum of 10 on a trip, arrived we set off to place fresh nets. Once this was done, it took about 20 minutes, we moved on to recovery the previous days nets. Once the hauling process began much to my surprise a lobster appeared! In fact on that day the majority of the catch was rock lobsters - see picture. It took a fair amount of time to complete the hauling exercise but every minute was exciting as you didn’t know what would appear. All undersized fish and sea creatures were immediately returned to the ocean to continue to grow and preserve stocks. Once the process was complete we headed off to a quiet bay for swimming and relaxing whilst Antonia and the crew prepared our lunch. The lunch consisted of bruschetta followed by lobster, spaghetti cooked with the pan juices of the lobster etc. Greek and potatoes salad was plentiful plus white wine, water and soft drinks. After a good rest we could resume swimming or in my case I enjoyed a quiet nap. We returned to the harbour at around 4 pm throughly satisfied having been entertained royally by a wonderful family.   a splendid unique day out for all the family. "

We were collected from our hotel and brought down to the harbour and taken onto the boat by Antonia for homemade cake and coffee. We literally have had the most amazing time being taken out to place the nets for the next 2 days catch.. then to go and collect the nets set beforehand for our lunch!  We waited in anticipation for the catch to be pulled in and couldn’t have been more excited to see lobsters and spider crabs come aboard!!  While we were taken to a gorgeous bay To swim and relax in the beautiful settings, antonia prepared the the most incredible lunch. Freshly prepared bruschetta on the tastiest bread to start, and then to be served with the most amazing seafood spread with spaghetti , potatoes and salad!!  Water was crystal clear, fish and lobster was so fresh and tasty And i genuinely cannot recommend this trip enough!! Antonia, her husband and the amazing fisherman who brought in the catch were all a pleasure to meet and spend the day with! If youre unsure whether to book- do it!! :D"

From start to finish were made to feel welcome, and within 30 minutes of boarding the boat, we felt that we were with friends that we had known all along. Antonia and Michalis, and their lovely daughter Nikki who also joined us, were superb hosts, and our lunch consisted of our ""catch"" for the day - lobsters - with home grown veg and home-made wine!. It happened to be my birthday, and turned out to be one of the most memorable I have ever had. We even had cake. What a lovely personal touch. Thank you Antonia and Michalis"

That was a real treat. When the fishing nets were brought up it was a delightful catch this was going to be our lunch which was delicious. Everyone on board was happy to chip in and get the fish from the nets.  While some of us went for a swim the family were preparing our lunch which consisted of lobster, crab, red mullet plus other fishes Greek salad, spaghetti there was more than enough for the 12 people on board and it was a delight to have Antonia and family joining us for lunch and enjoying hearing of the local knowledge which was helped down with homemade wine. From the moment we made contact to book the trip we were kept informed and the response was immediate if we had questions. All in all it was a great day we thoroughly recommend this trip great family. It’s a pleasure being around Greek people who we find kind and considerate. This trip I would like to do again.Barry & Lin"

Leaving around 8.30am we set out as the morning hue still shrouded the Islands around us. The Ionian sea was calm, the sky was azure and the sun was still warming the sea and land. Anatonia was the most attentive host. The day started with Greek coffee and a fabulous breakfast cake. Travelling along the coast line you get to see Kefalonia at its very best.The food, caught and landed whilst on board, is prepared and cooked while you either swim in the bay or stay on deck drinking home made wine. We were served an absolute feast. Beautifully cooked, we were joined by the Captain to enjoy the oceans larder together. We dined as kings!I would highly recommend this trip."

Fantastic to see all the different varieties of fish being reeled in, including my favourite - Lobster -  Lots and lots of Lobsters - I have never eaten so much Lobster in one meal! Absolutely delicious!  This was all cooked up for a Delicious lunch with fresh vegetables and salads and fruit from the family's garden and served with very spagetti and nice Greek wine.  Cold drinking water is also provided.  We, the guests swam in the clear blue sea whilst our feast was being prepared. Antonia provided us with a wonderful overview of Greek life and history in between cooking and attending to our every need.  Wonderful hosts and perfect holiday activity.  Highly highly recommend this trip to everyone visiting Kefalonia.  The sea was calm and the views stunning too. Myself, my friend and my cousin thoroughly enjoyed the day.  I also very much liked the fact that it is a small family run trip which only accommodates 12 people - there were 9 of us which allowed us a lot of personal attention and question & answer time too.  Antonia even drove us back to our hotel!  Thank you very much Antonia and Michalis and crew."

However, I cannot commend Antonia and Michaelis enough for their amazing fishing trip. The experience is truly not to be missed. The kindness, the food and the fishing experience is more than you could ever expect.. Swimming off the boat whilst lunch is being cooked is sublime and you will make new friends and enjoy relaxation beyond belief.Do it. You will not regret it."

If you do that Antonia will take care of you from breakfast until the end of the day. You start from a greek cooffee and homemade cake. Then you can see the real work of a fisherman and you can swim near the coast in the blue water. You have lunch with a lot of fish and local product from agriculture. I really enjoy all of that!

She was very nice and helpful when I was arranging the trip with her, and she was so lovely on the day. My elder daughter got some sea sickness (our fault, as she gets motion sickness in cars and we thought she'd be ok with a pill, so don't be discouraged), but we still had a good day. Really nice food, quite an educational experience (fishing in those waters is not an easy way to make a living!), and a great way to get a different view of a beautiful island. Would definitely recommend."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S1556VVsimons,October 2017,5,An Excellent day out,"Thankyou to Michalis, Antonia and crew for a lovely day out on board their traditional greek fishing boat. We all had a wonderful time, I have my own fishing boat back in England where we catch fish by rod and line.Nets were set for sardines which were later cooked on the bbq with swordfish, tasty scorpion fish all with salads and spaghetti and wine and beer; a true feast worthy of a top restaurant.swimming off the boat was great all with the alluring backdrop of the Kefalonian scenery.10 out of 10"

The day we spent with Captain Michalis and his crew was memorable and a lot of fun. We don't get that much time off and this trip was really worth it. The vessel was comortable, stable and roomy for all of us. The seafood - harvested from the days catch - was of a wide variety and beautifully prepared for us. We were met at the harbour and brought to the boat so most of our time was on board. I would certainly reccomend this activity to anyone interested in the Sea and it's bounties and the fishermans way of life."

My husband and I, along with my brother-in-law who was in crutches due to a broken leg, as well as his family went on the excursion in late August. Antonia and family were very helpful to ensure my brother-in-law was comfortable the entire trip. What a great experience for my two nephews (and all of us) to watch as Mustafa brought in the 2km of nets and watch the fish accumulate as the nets were brought in. Then, while we went out for a wonderful swim at this beautiful cove, Antonia, Michalis, and Mustafa cooked a wonderful meal for us, including Greek salad, potato salad, and a variety of bbq and fried fish! Delicious!!  It was a fantastic day and a trip well worth taking. We all learned a few things about fishing and about Kefalonia!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anna0831,September 2017,5,Unusual and Excellent Day,Thank you so much to Antonia and her family for a wonderful experience. A really different excursion. My 13 year old son enjoyed the day too. Antonia's preparation of the food was also exceptional

Antonia is an amazing cook who goes out of her way to make sure everyone is looked after and happy.Secondly the sea was so blue, the scenery so beautiful, the day out so calm and peaceful.Finally this it is so interesting to see how the fish is caught.This is a must do!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarAway809922,August 2017,5,Cannnot fault in any way,What a great experience with a great family. We were greeted by Antonia for a light breakfast with Greek coffee. Then we went out to retrieve  the 2km of net they put out the evening before. We had an assortment of Scorpion fish Red Snapper and various others. They sorted through the catch and made a lovely fish soup with lemon and fried Red Snapper with fresh vegetables from their garden and washed down with family made white wine. Dinner will change depending on the catch which makes it more interesting watching the net come in. The trip the day before had 8 Lobster! The food was amazing. We got plenty of time for swimming before and after lunch as well. Another annual holiday must do for us.

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/658derekb,August 2017,5,Traditional Fishing at its BEST,"I went out with Michalis and the family whilst in Kefalonia. I had a great time as I am a keen fisherman, and to watch how it is really done with nets, it was amazing to see how much net actually came out off the water , and the amount of different things in the net , which was cooked fresh for us to eat later that day. Antonio even made some lobster up for my wife who didn't come as she gets travel sick on boats but LOVES lobster.Whilst the food was being prepared it gave us all time to chill, swim , or fish , then after the excellent food still time to go for a swim again , before our return trip back to port A long day ,so excellent value for the money and very educating for young children, youths and adults alike I would  give this a go if its your sort of thing OR you fancy something totally differentWell Done to ALL of them"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unhappy1965,July 2017,5,What an amazing day!,"We spent the day with Antonia and her family on their traditional fishing boat.   After being served delicious home made cake and coffee, we left the harbour just after 8am.  We went out to sea for about half an hour then watched as the 2km long nets were pulled up to expose what had been caught - from star fish to red snappers to lobster to octopus.  We stopped just off the coast for a pre-lunch swim and then we all feasted on the day's catch once it had been prepared and cooked by Mustaffa alongside the wonderful dips,  salads and bread provided by Antonia.  It was all delicious.  We returned back to the harbour just after four thirty after having the best day of our holiday by far. Thank you to Antonia, Michaelis, Mustaffa and Nikki for such a memorable day."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ale_madame,July 2017,5,A beautiful day,"thanks to Antonia, her family and Mustapha we spent an unusual and relaxing day on their fishing boat. the tour took almost one day (abour 8 am to 4 pm) and consisted on a beautiful sail along the coast near Spartia, till the place where the nets were pulled (which in itself is something you don't see everyday) and again to a secluded beach where we had plenty of time for swimming waiting for the fish jush catched to be cooked :)Never in my life I had fish so fresh and juicy, I felt like Gollum ;)But most important of all is the nice, friendly and warm hospitality Antonia and all the family granted us and the other people on the boat that day. That helped all of us to mingle and relax together and contributed a lot to the whole success of the expedition."

3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eppar,June 2017,5,"Amazing, authentic, relaxing day on Kefalonian fishing boat","I fully agree with the previous reviews! The day out on the see on a traditional wooden fishing boat, with the most hospitable and warm-hearted family and crew of Captain Michalis, was very special. No tourist jargon or party boat hassle, but Michalis, Antonia and Niki let us be part of their family for a day, sharing an experience and information way beyond any normal tour we have been on. The refreshing swim, and delicious lunch made on board of the fish we caught, and of the fresh vegetables from their garden, and Antonia's yammy cake and dessert topped it all.We were 6 adults on the boat - had plenty of space to move around -  but also for families with children this is fun. See their website, call or send a message to Antonia, she speaks perfect English, and replies soon."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyer605688,June 2017,5,Outstanding experience - a must do!,"An incredible day out - authentic fishing boat experience. Retrieving  the 2km nets that have been cast out at 2am prior to the trip adds to the excitement, because whatever is caught is cooked fresh for lunch on the boat's tiny but adequate kitchen. Amazed at how good a cook Capitani michelas is - everything was perfect from the lobster spaghetti to the homemade pastry desserts. Don't miss the chance to do this boat trip - it will be the best day of the holiday for sure and talked about for many years to come. "

We then went out to sea to pull in the nets that her husband Michaelis had been out and laid at 3 am. The nets go on forever and take over an hour to pull in , but the fish that are caught are very varied and saw fish never seen before.Then the nets are emptied of the fish  mainly by Mustapha and Michaelis but you can help if you want? We then stopped at a beautiful  spot, where we swam in the clear turquoise waters whilst Antonia prepared Lunch. After lunch there was the opportunity to swim again or fish with rods.The pictures say it all,never have I had fish so fresh and so much, the best lunch and experience of our whole holiday .We eventually made our way back , returning about four thirty. Great value day out with a lovely family, not forgetting the other passengers on the boat who also made the day enjoyable.You will not be disappointed"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ange6342,June 2017,5,A unique day out,"We spent a great day with Antonia, Michalis and their daughter Nicky.  Antonia replied to our initial enquiries almost immediately and made us feel like friends straight away.  We enjoyed coffee and cake (which was delicious) and then set off on  our adventure with our crew mates.  After a short sail out into the turquoise sea, we stopped and Michalis and Mustapha began to bring in the fishing nets they had put out very early that morning.  The nets were about 2 km long and the catch was amazing; red snapper, scorpion fish , lobster (and others I can't remember).  We then swam in the clear waters off Spartia  while Antonia prepared a feast of freshly caught fish, potato salad like I've never tasted and a massive salad.  We had wine from their own grapes and a huge dessert which I can't remember the name of but it begins with K!!  We had such a lovely day getting to know everyone and we were sorry to say goodbye.  If you want to try a day trip which is unusual, try this, you won't be disappointed."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crabuzy,June 2017,5,Strongly recommend: Most memorable experience in Kefalonia,"The tour itself is really fun, we started at 8am and she served us a Greek coffee with her homemade cake which is made from eggs from her farm. and we sail for 30 mins and arrive in that spot and starts to pull the net. Then we sail to another location which is good for swimming while she is preparing lunch. The potato salad, green salad and especially the garlic mashed potato is so delicious. We also delicious fresh fried  fishes. Really wonderful. In addition, Michalis is really welcoming host. She responded to messengers super fast, always within one day even, less in 1 hour. The part I especially like is she really spend time to explain the process of the tour like in chat, not just ask you to check their page. It just feels like you are so welcomed. She checked the weather 2 days and stayed connected. After the tour, she sent us photos immediately in the same day. She only takes up to 12 guest. The size is just right to to cozy and relax."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marymN940HT,September 2016,5,Best boat trip ever!!!,"This was the day trip that we never wanted to end!! It was such a great day out, we met at the traditional wooden boat at Svoronata at eightish, were welcomed on board with cake and coffee and teas, then we set off on the crystal clear sea, round the coast, was fun spotting places that you recognised, some fishing nets were hauled aboard, and it was fascinating watching the different species of fish that had been collected, some I had never seen, ie a ""glass fish"" just looked like, a ball of glass!! (not a jelly fish!!) then we stopped for optional swimming, and refreshments were offered too!!! then we were able to have a go at fishing with a rod, and there was a little competition between the males on the boat!! (my partner came last lol)!! which caused much merriment!!! then there was was more catch to be got aboard, and we had a go at untangling the fish from the nets, not as easy as it looks!!! we then had a fantastic lunch with the fresh fish we had just caught, with the best potato salad, and spaghetti and salad!! we then made a leisurely trip back to port, it was a full day!! We laughed such a lot, as Antonia and Michalis are such great hosts, and the others we were with, were all in agreement, it was the BEST DAY EVER!!! Thanks guys"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sara41155,October 2016,5,Amazing day's fishing trip,Firstly we had a very warm welcome from skipper Michalis' to his boat at Agia Paraskevi- we motored to an area near Spartia where nets that were nearly a mile long had been laid the previous day. The crew picked up the nets and we watched the nets being cleared; the anchor was dropped and we did some sea fishing with rods that was very successful for everyone. Then we moved to a small bay where we were able to swim while the crew prepared the lunch which was delicious especially the pasta!A really interesting day and worth every penny! (or cent!) Ideal for families.
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R6847DUhelenl,August 2016,5,Brilliant day trip with amazing hosts ,"Found on trip advisor and booked 2 days before with VERY quick responses from Antonia. Arrived at Agia Pelagia where Mr Michalouras moors the boat. Greeted with homemade cake and coffee. Mustafa from Egypt helps to bring in the fish on long lines while we watched. Squid and lobster and fish all prepped on the boat and cooked in the galley. Fresh potato salad - capers dill and parsley really lifted the flavours of the beautiful fish,and the pasta got a thumbs up from the Italians so must be good !! Jump into turquoise sea and swim or sit back and enjoy the sun. Nicky was very helpful and entertained the other children. REALLY RECOMMEND this trip !!!! Coming back next year with our kids- already booked the flights xxxxx efkharisto Antonia and Michal !!!!! Xxxx"
