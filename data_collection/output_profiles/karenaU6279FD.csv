Going down hill fast!,"I can’t say how disappointed I am with Harvey’s. My first room was uninhabitable. The second room was a tad better but the entire hotel is getting really worn out. The pit bosses were rude and unaccommodating. While some dealers are very nice, it is very apparent that they are unhappy with their jobs and the company who employs them. They are so cheap that the rooms no longer have coffee pots. You now have to pay for self parking and they don’t even restock the shampoo. Horrible!",Date of stay: April 2019,Harveys Lake Tahoe,1,"Stateline, Nevada"
Excellent unique fishing trip,"We thoroughly enjoyed our day with Anthi, and her crew Mohammad and Marcos!

We caught lots of fish, octopus and shrimp and had a feast on all of it!

Anthi is very knowledgeable and a pleasure to learn from, not only about fishing but the Greek culture!

I highly recommend utilizing their services!

Thanks for a great time today! July 9th, 2018.

Going downhill,"I used to love PH. Now I will not stay there again. No coffee makers, elimination of employees by using automated check in kiosks, remotes and safe didn’t work and they charge even more for their ridiculous resort fees.",Date of stay: March 2018,Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino,1,"Las Vegas, Nevada"

Loard’s ice cream,I used to be addicted to the peanut butter chocolate ice cream but it just doesn’t have enough peanut butter anymore. I now stick with a hot fudge sundae. Can’t go wrong there!,Date of visit: December 2017,Loard's Ice Cream,1,"Moraga, California"
Rio,The Rio is dated and needs renovation. Penn and Teller was also very boring. Especially for the price.,Date of experience: January 2016,Casino at the Rio All-Suite Hotel,1,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
