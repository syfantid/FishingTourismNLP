1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelEU1983,June 2020,5,Booked 2 trips in the same week!!!!!!!!,"Something I will never forget. At the begging I was not very happy with the idea of my husband to do this excursion.The result after the first trip was to book myself another trip as anniversary gift for my husband.Friendly crew, spottless clean boat, excellent cooked dinner from day’s catch accompanied with various local delicacies!!! Thank you captain George for such an amazing experience!! Definitely we will visit you again."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_W799IE,August 2020,5,Fishing at it's best!!,"Speechless of the experience...The best day of our holidays. Suggested for everyone.From early the morning until late the afternoon, was a great day with my family out in the sea.Crew is very friendly and make you feel comfortable every minute onboard!"

0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomlA1824ZU,September 2020,5,Great day ,Amazing tour in zante 100% recommend George and the crew are amazing!! We went early morning and spend the day sea fishing and stopped at swimming spots. Eat fresh fish on board and stopped at a cafe by the sea 
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillyW854,July 2020,5,Day with a difference,"A fantastic day out with a difference, sail with the fishermen, watch how they catch fish, take in a couple of stops for swimming and relaxing then the crew cook what they catch and feed you delicious Ionian cuisine, excellent day out well worth it if you fancy a change from the pool or beach. Highly recommended"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wbilling,September 2020,5,Best ever boat trip.,"When we went I was a bit sceptical about it, thinking I have been on fishing trips before but this was completely different. There was 6 of us another group were unable to go at the last minute. Luckily enough I wrong about it and we had one of the best trips ever. The boat is a proper working  fishing boat with with all the nets. So he actually puts out the nets takes you to various place to view and swim then returns a few hours later to bring in the nets {they were a cple of kilometres long}. You then have your diner with the fresh fish. I am not really a fish eater, I am now it was fabulous. All of us had a fantastic meal along side the homemade wine.. The captain and the crew were superb and also as with most Greeks we have met I love their humour as well as the passion and pride they have in their work. Finally one thing to point out was he does not overload  the boat with loads and loads of people  just to make money. On the way back we passed a boat sailing out of Zante town, it was not much bigger than ours, it was absolutely rammed with people like sardines. To me that is not an enjoyable day out. All in all the six of us had a fabulous day out and we would highly recommend it to anyone."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F6248EMianb,August 2020,5,Trip,"Superb day out, great food, great swimming stops, great atmosphere on board, very informative, if you are in zakynthos give this trip a try"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/car0line63,September 2020,5,Out of this world,"I can’t distinguish a favourite part of this experience, just that it was unforgettable and I will remember it forever. I will always remember Giorgos staying by my side as we swam to shore, I am terrified when I am out of my depth but I did it ! Learning how the whole process works to catching the fish, reeling it in and eating it was just so unique an experience, so out of the ordinary. I would recommend doing this to anyone, well worth the money and the hosts are fabulous and friendly . Hope one day to do it again!!"

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fitzyit,September 2019,5,Read the reviews then just book it.,"Booked our trip from the UK and everything was very easy.Our original trip was cancelled due to adverse weather so Giorgos (captain) tried to fit us in at a later date. Called that morning saying he would have to cancel again due to weather. Rang me back about 2 hours saying although we were about 3 hours late  would we still like to go but on a condensed trip as Giorgos did not want to let us down. We all agreed to go. Giorgos said the trip would not be as long as normal but we would get a feeling of what normally happened.So glad we went, the best day of our holiday. The boat is absolutely spotless. After coffee Giorgos explained what we would do and explained all about fishing. So interesting and informative. We put nets out and went to an island with no one on it for swimming etc. Went back to collect nets, hoping we would get some fish, which we did. More swimming at a different beach while lunch was prepared. Food was excellent and so tasty and also very plentiful.All in all an excellent day we all agreed that if we return we would do it again but hope to get the full day in. Can not recommend this trip enough, all crew and facilities first class."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aliyajd,August 2019,5,Amazing,This was by far the best day of our holiday. It was a great learning experience and lots of fun. The boat was clean and beautiful and they paid attention to detail using beautiful hand made plates instead of plastic.. the fish we caught was well cooked and delicious.. all in all a fantastic day. Thank you Giorgos!

4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarahp55555555,August 2019,5,Amazing day fishing ,"Had an amazing day fishing ( 27/8/19) with George and his crew , the boat can take 12 passengers but we decided to hire it privately as we were a party of 7 . We all had a go at putting the nets out about 1500 metres , then over to a private island for a swim to shore , drinks in Porta Roma which is beautiful. Kids had a go on a speedboat inflatable ride which they loved! Then lunch on board the boat which was delicious, best day of our holiday, only Georgios has the licence to do this type of trip , was brilliant day! Thanks Georgios "
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisachaffey,September 2019,5,HIGHLY RECOMMEND ZANTE FISHING TOURS,Myself and my two brothers went on the all day traditional Greek fishing trip with captain Giorgos and his crew. The trip was throughly enjoyable and Giorgos was very informative. They really care about the environment and spoke passionately about the importance of sustainable fishing.Hot and cold beverages were always available as were snacks. Lunch was plentiful and delicious.  I would highly recommend using Zante fishing tours.Thank you Giorgos and crew for a fantastic day.Lisa.
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mabel1018,August 2019,5,Fantastic day out!,"Our family spent a fantastic day with Cpt. Giorgos last week.  My children (aged 15 and 13) had the most amazing time learning about the fishing and then diving in from the boat in some of the most beautiful spots on the island.  Nothing was too much trouble and the communication throughout was excellent.  Cpt. Giorgos even suggested we wait a day before going on the trip as the sea conditions would be calmer for the family.  Everything worked perfectly.  You can park your car next to the ship, coffee and pastries waiting as you leave the harbour and the fresh fish lunch was delicious.  I would also recommend taking a map and a pen as Cpt. Giorgios will also tell you about all the best beaches, tavernas and things to do on the island.  It was like having your very own tour guide!  I would highly recommend this trip and hope to return again one day!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mbscarey,August 2019,5,Fantastic day Fishing,"This trip was booked to celebrate a birthday, there were 7 of us in our group and it was the most amazing day ever.  I was a little worried about sea sickness which I had suffered from before, I have to say I didn’t, feel unwell at all.  The whole day from start to finish was excellent, Giorglas and his crew where most welcoming and informative the whole day,  from putting the nets out to  the surrounding area and the bays we stopped in.  The food was delicious,  and we enjoyed sitting and chatting with the Other 5 guests on board.   Yes it was an early start but so worth it"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElfCaerdydd,August 2019,5,Amazing day out,"I can not recommend this trip enough. We were made so welcome from beginning to end and the trip was an amazing experience for us adults as well as the children. We consisted of 4 adults and 5 children ranging from 5 years old to 15. Our first impressions were how spotlessly clean the boat was and how friendly George was. He was cheerful and very informative. Even the kids listened! After lowering the nets, we went swimming at a private island which was so beautiful. The children were amazed when we pulled the nets in and they saw all the fish that they’d caught. We then had another stop while George’s mother in law cooked for us. Absolutely delicious food. The kids even enjoyed it. George’s wine tasted amazing. Really great to see the kids tasting the fish that they’d caught. An unique experience for them. Thank you so much for a truly memorable day. The kids say it’s the best day of the holiday."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/750deanm,August 2019,5,Amazing,I booked this trip for me and my son for a bit of bonding while on holiday. What a amazing day we had giorgias was very informative and a pleasure to be around. We learnt about how they fish and stopped of for swimming while the nets was out. We ate our catch and was absolutely beautiful if you have one trip in zante make it this one.
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WalesWorldwide,August 2019,5,What an amazing day!,"What an amazing day we had. From the moment we arrived on the boat to be greeted by traditional greek coffee and pastries we were made to feel welcome and part of Giorgio‘s fishing family. We were all taught how to let the net out and bring it back in and my son even caught his own fish by line fishing which completely made his day. We ate what we caught, all cooked by Giorgio’s mother in law, and what a spread we had all washed down with Giorgio’s home made wine and ouzo. One of the highlights of the trip was stopping off at an uninhabited private island in Zone A of the marine conservation area, where we got to snorkel and jump/dive off the boat and swim to the island. I can’t recommend this trip enough, it was the highlight of our holiday for us and my two children and if you only do one trip while on Zakynthos do this one."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/276mathiast,August 2019,5,The undisputed highlight of our holiday!,"My girlfriend and I were looking for day trip by boat and got in contact with Georgios a few days in advance. Due to a cancellation we were lucky to get on the trip, so I recommend you to book the trip from home or at least a few days before (just to be sure). Georgios and his team took good care of us and we enjoyed a very nice meal consisting of the fish we caught, a fresh greek salad, spaghetti with squid and cuddle fish and bruschetta. We also got to swim and snorkel in the beautiful waters of Zakynthos. Don't hesitate to book this trip! It's ideal for both families and couples. Georgios is very easy to get in touch with, so if you have any questions, he will be happy to answer them."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/597vagelisa,August 2019,5,Simply amazing,Very original idea!A nice way to see all the beautiful places in the island.Crystal clear blue waters and tasty food.And if you are lucky like us you will get to see some turtles as well!
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hellamour,August 2019,5,Highlight of our vacation,"We booked a morning/afternoon fishing tour at Zante Fishing Tours. We were in contact with the owner (Georgios) a couple of days before the tour and we were given prompt instructions on departure time, the program of the tour etc. We arrived too early on the day of the tour (approx. 40 min earlier) but were greeted very very friendly by Georgios and his crew.As we waited for the other guests to arrive we were given a nice cup of greek coffee and homemade breakfast sweets. As we took off to our first destination, Georgios explained to us the basics of fishing. Being newbee to fishing, it was really nice to listen to the explanation and techniques used during fishing. After the explanation, the fishing nets were put out in the sea and we left for a great swim near a deserted island. The water here was so nice and great for snorkling. We were provided with some refreshing fruits after the swim. We continued our trip by pulling our the fishing nets from the sea and looking at out catch. It was really nice to experience fishing so closely - Georgios’ his crew was also very nice and provided us with instructions on which fish we could touch (and which not because of the poison), and we were even allowed to pull out the fish from the fishing nets ourselves (this was so much fun)We took a second swim at the Porto Azurro beach - which is a beach where you can cover your whole body and face in a clay mask. Straight from the sea, it does not get any purer than that! It was a great experience and added a lot to our trip. After being completely worn out after the swimming sessions, we got back on the boat around 3 o clock PM to a delicious late lunch made from a.o. the fish we catched from the sea. The food was prepared by Georgios’ his mother in law who was with us with the day, it tasted delicious!! Also, Georgios’ his lovely wife and daughter joined us during the trip, as the tour was on a Sunday they were helping out. In summary: this was te highlight of our vacation in Zakynthos. Would not have want to missed out on this experience at all - it was truly perfect, from the food to the program to the music on the boat. The hospitality of Georgios and his family is major and this created the great atmosphere during the whole trip. We had so much fun, a big THANK YOU to Georgios and his family for providing us with this epic experience!!! "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarsteph1,August 2019,5,Amazing Zante Fishing Tour,"This journey with Georgios and his crew was simply amazing! Departure from Zante harbour, breakfast on the boat, put the net in the water, go on a wonderful beach to wait to catch, come back, remove the fishes, go on another beach and finally eat the fishes... All this in a beautiful environment! You will love it, just do it!"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/109DavidW109,July 2019,5,Best fishing tour ever,"Our day with Zante fishing tour was amazing. A great crew, beautiful swim stops, delicious food. Highly recommend this fishing tour to everyone!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F6248EMianb,August 2019,5,Trip,"This is a must do trip when in zakynthos, very professional and very  greek, fish caught, cooked (by the FBI) superb day out "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cerid885,August 2019,5,Highly recommend,"Booked this through PM on facebook and communication was swift & informative. Didn’t want the usual boat trips available and this sounded exactly what we were looking for. I was messaged the evening before that there would be a later start with apologies. It was only 30 mins & caused no concerns to us. We arrived earlier than expected and was invited straight away into the boat. Giorgos was a very friendly captain and immediately made everyone feel at home as soon as we stepped on to his boat. It was amazingly clean for a fishing boat and we were immediately offered Greek coffee’s to wake us up. He kept us up to date as others were delayed arriving (his English is brilliant). We still left earlier than he had messaged me the night before. He explained to us all how the nets work and some history as we were passing by the island. When they started to cast the nets it’s very hypnotic and hard not to study the technique used. He encouraged the other guests to try too... It takes about 20mins - nearly a KM in length will not be quick! No one was bored during this time it’s entrancing and the strangers on board started to become companions.. we went for a lovely swim at a secluded spot called Pelouzo Island. Giorgos explained the history of the island and also that the marine conservation & WWF had a part in the island too (very encouraging info) that he is also a member of.We moved after a couple of hours to collect up the nets. This was great to watch aswell... We went off for another swim in deeper waters with the snorkels that he’d provided. Giorgos explained to a few of us his catches and what’s available and when-his aim for today was red mullet I loved the snorkelling-never done it before... i eventually got called back to the boat  Dinner was ready. It looked incredible! Never tried so many different fish sea bream; mackerel even a cuttlefish to name few. Along with his home made wine available and the wonderful food we all got to know the others on board from different countries on their holiday and conversations were flowing. I can’t say enough about this trip, it was perfect from start to finish, you never went hungry and always had cold drinks offered. This was exactly what we’d been looking for and more! Don’t hesitate to book with 12 max on board it really is a welcoming personal experience to remember. "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kkolenac,July 2019,5,Unforgoten adventure MUST TRY 👌🏻,"It was an unforgettable day and I would be very sorry that I would not take part in this excursion, fishing. As soon as we boarded the boat, they served us with excellent coffee, biscuits. Captain Giorgios  is very friendly and hospitable, as well as his crew. The fish that we caught with the grid were prepared for lunch and they were excellent, and we all had a choice of drinks in an unlimited quantity all day. We also took a couple of beaches where we could swim. He makes sure you feel great and remember the adventure. It's a must try Fishing tour on Zante.greetings from Slovenija Kristijan"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Welshtash1970,July 2019,5,A Truly Fantastic Day at Sea!!!,"We experienced this fantastic boat trip with Zante Fishing Tours whilst on holiday in Kalamaki. We have holidayed here for many years and were looking for something different. This trip provided this and lots lots more! From being involved in casting the nets, watching the catch come in and swimming in some truly beautiful places, all topped off with a wonderful lunch which included the fish we had caught fresh from the sea! Giorgos and his “FBI” in-laws were such marvellous hosts, and provided great insight into fishing techniques and of the island. They ensured we sailed the waters in such a way to prevent a rough ride and therefore no chance of sea sickness, which we were all slightly worried about. Life jackets, snorkels and flotation aids were all provided to help those less confident in the water. The swimming stop offs were in areas which were isolated and off the beaten track, making the experience all the more special. We were a party of 10 and everyone enthused about the trip. In fact once telling others about it back at our hotel, many swiftly booked in the following days. This was truly the highlight of our holiday and will definitely return to do it again next year! Thanks to Captain Giorgos and the family, from Dave, Natasha and friends!"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cguevara,July 2019,5,If you do one trip in Zante - do this one!,"We now live in Zakynthos and this trip was recommended to us by friends they raved about it so much we booked and took along our daughter and her partner, leaving from the Port of Zakynthos we headed out to sea, George (Captain) explained what we would do and what we would see over the day, swimming trips were organised and undertaken, George gave us a running history not only of the island but also the Zakynthos way of life, the importance of sustainable fishing and the role people play, we were all encouraged to help the crew drop the fishing nets the catch from which would be our delicious lunch later, Red Mullet, Octopus,Sea Bream with side dishes of spaghetti salad and bruschetta all cooked on board by Georges amazing mother in law who also doubles up as an FBI Agent (we think that may be false as she looked more CIA) all in all a truly magnificent day made all the more pleasurable by good company on board from Sweden and Slovenia  and also a very welcoming crew. Yammas George from Joe Ann Mairi and Dan - ps we plan to be back "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rachel15F,June 2019,5,What a great day out,Celebrated a friends 50th birthday on board and had the most fun.  The fish freshly caught and cooked as part of an amazing lunch.  So friendly and welcoming on boat.  Highly recommend a trip with Zante Fishing Tours.  Thanks for the memories. 
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Experience793598,June 2019,5,Sniffer’s 50th!,"Well, what can I say, came with 13 mates, booked with George a while back, and we had a brilliant day!!  Great fun, swimming, great hosts, and the lunch/ wine etc was lovely! Caught some fish too, and had a swim with a turtle! Great thanks to George, his mum in law, and other crew, a great day!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gamanc2015,June 2019,5,A unique experience that shouldn’t be missed,"A special day spent with special people that are passionate about what they do, at the end even preparing us an absolutely exquisite meal from the fish caught on board.The ride is a commercial fishing ship that fits a maximum of 10 people and doesn’t cause nausea. It is incredibly clean and well taken care of. The commercial net fishing is an experience absolutely worth trying.Way more interesting and engaging than a simple tourist boat trip around the island. We even had the chance to anchor the ship near a private island and swim by marvelous views.Giorgos, the ship’s commander, is an incredible person, very welcoming and friendly. It was an absolute pleasure listening and learning about all the wonders of Greece. From interesting facts about the island to amazing tavernas known only by locals. Took his recommendations to heart, the culinary experience being unbeatable."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larryuan,June 2019,5,Fantastic day with Giorgos,"It is my first time ocean fishing.Giorgos is the best captain! He is knowledgable, and likes to share with people.  Such a good experience. It's not only about fishing. The food we got is fabulous as well!!"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X885CLneilm,June 2019,5,Boat trip you will never forget,"An amazing day spent with the crew of Zante Fishing tours.You get to go aboard an authentic fishing boat, get up close and personal with the 2 crew. The captain makes you feel welcome and wants to make sure the day is on of continual happiness and pleasure. You go out , put out fishing nets and then bathe and swim waiting for your catch . Get the nets in and then the captains mother in law cooks the fish and serves it with spaghetti and bruschetta.Washed down with wine and laughter.Best day you could have on board any boat .Thank you for a wonderful experience."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matgaudreau,June 2019,5,A must do trip,"First of all, the Captain, Giorgios, is one of the most friendly person I've met. When we arrived, he offered us coffee and biscuits made by his mother-in-law, who does the cooking in the shop. He will also talk to you like you are one of his best friend and it makes the experience very special and intimate. The ship is extremely clean and it's easy of access. It has a toilet, a couple of benches and you can also go in the front next to the Captain's cabin to sunbathe. The experience is a thing you have to live if you go to zakynthos. Giorgios will explain the process of fishing with nets, the type of fish you will catch and tell you fishing stories. The two places we go swimming are incredible. You will see fishes if you have water goggles and the water is very clear and warm. Finally, you will eat a very good dinner,made by the Captain's mother-in-law, composed of the fishes you caught and many other things. "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christina1zeri,June 2019,5,A joyful day at sea,"Great experience!!!  Getting fish out of the nets is such a fun! The greek flair at sea. Captain George - a higly skilled sailor, his mother in law -the best cook ever- and Sadik will make your day. Dont miss it."

2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelpJ1283WW,May 2019,5,THE best day of our holiday!,"Its an early start, but so worth it. With only 12 passengers it was a very intimate and interesting trip. Giorgio was so friendly and makes everyone feel very welcome as soon as you get on board. You can have as much ‘hands on’ experience as you wish, helping to put nets in and out, taking fish out of the nets etc. Then relax in the sea for a swim before lunch is served. Fresh pasta, fish, salad and wine. Beautiful! All in all a truly unique fishing experience! THANK YOU! Giorgio and team for a very memorable day"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomlA1824ZU,September 2018,5,Great trip,Loved the trip with George and the crew!Got the 7.30 start and was well worth it Had multiple swimming stops and even cooked seafood that was caught along the trip! A must do day trip for everyone involved! Cheers George 
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billywood2404,September 2018,5,Excellent Day out on the sea,"If you fancy a change from sunbathing and doing something a little bit different, I would recommend you try this trip with Captain Georgios and his crew, Set sail from Zante Town about 07.30 sail for approx 1 hr then put the nets in, move closer to the shore have some breakfast / refreshments then set sail to pick the nets up then watch Gergios and his crew land the fish, then some are cooked aboard and served with spaghetti / rice local wine / local beers, fruit. Lovely day out and a stop for swimming / relaxing. 5 star day out"

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dina240,September 2018,5,"Fishing, food & fun!!","This day out with the lovely Captain Giorgos and his crew was well worth getting up early for!  We watched the sunrise as we headed out to sea from Zante Town at 7.30am.  After the nets were cast we headed for a lovely, secluded beach only accessible by boat or bike for swimming and free time, then back to haul in the catch which we subsequently stuffed our faces with over a lovely lunch set up on board with wine, beer and charming conversation with Giorgos.  On the return journey we sunbathed and had a few more drinks ... bliss!!  We went on this trip as a group of 12 friends and it's quite a unique day out as far as boat trips in Zakynthos go.  It's safe to say that after we recovered from the early start we all had a brilliant time.   Thanks Giorgos and crew for looking after us and for a wonderful day out on the water! XX"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilykatewoods,September 2018,5,This was a ripper tour!,"Friendly and informative captain, Giorgos. Enjoyable net-fishing experience followed by a sumptuous buffet on board (which included our catch of red mullet - delicious!).Also included swimming stops and a beach stop. A top-value experience not to be missed! Would definitely recommend - Tom and Trish"

If you do the trip as a private large group booking, it is fantastic value for money!Giorgos is very helpful in accommodating everyone’s needs on board, we booked as a group of 11 of all ages and abilities and the trip was fantastic from start to finish.We were a bit dubious about stepping on board a fishing boat and imagined all sorts!  How very pleasantly surprised we all were.  The boat looks brand new!  It is so clean and tidy you would think it was someone’s home!The crew Giorgos, Sadek & Vaso look after you like you are family, it really is 5 star treatment!The food on board was by far the best meal of our whole vacation!  We had fresh baked traditional pastries, fresh fruits, Greek coffee, fruit juices, salad, olive oil, calamari spaghetti, freshly caught fish, bruschetta and wine – ALL homemade and simply delicious!  SO much food was available; they do NOT let you go hungry (this was a concern of mine and I always carry snacks).Vaso prepares all the food and drink on board and keeps it all flowing whilst keeping  on top of cleaning the boat, the slightest drip is soon cleaned up.Sadek is a professional fisherman and knows his stuff; he showed my son all the fish they caught and let him help get them off the nets and hold them.Giorgos is a fantastic, fisherman, captain and friend.  He is full of information about the local island and surrounding areas.  His personal background is very interesting and he is very knowledgeable.We snorkelled, swam and dived off the boat and we all thoroughly enjoyed it!  The fish you see in the beautiful spots he takes you to are breath taking.  We even saw a family of seals!  The little private beach is beautiful and they will supply you with dry boxes to put your stuff in when you swim out to keep your phone, towels etc. dry.The fishing part was a little rocky for me – I had to lie down whilst the nets were put down and pulled back in.  I also felt a little rocky for a day or 2 but that has not put me off and I will definitely return on Giorgos boat next year when we return.  The rest of our party on board were fine (I must be a light weight).If you forget anything on board, I’m sure Giorgos will help you out, he leant us dive masks and floats and I also charged my phone up whilst on board.There is a shower and toilet to use, which like the rest of the boat is spotlessly clean!If you have any questions at all get in touch with Giorgos and ask, he is very helpful!An absolutely fantastic trip, comes highly recommended and a must do whilst visiting the island of Zante!"

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dunena90,September 2018,5,"Fishing, swimming and 1st class hospitality","This is a must do day out when at this beautiful Greek island. With a maximum of 12 persons allowed a trip you get 5* treatment with plenty of room. We meet the crew first thing. Set sail and cast out the nets. They cruised around the beautiful coast to private bay for a swim and short break. We then returned to bring the nets in for our lunch .Went for a another swim whilst our large feast was prepared. Fresh fish, fresh spaghetti with squid, fresh salad with organic vegetables grew in the captains own garden. To top it of we had wine also made by the captain.  Highly recommend "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolinelespapillons,September 2018,5,Best trip in zante,Amazing trip. If you don't do this tripthen you're miss g a trip of a life time. George is a super captain and guide. His mother in law is an amazing cook
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimsD2879PJ,July 2018,5,"Excellent day out, authentic and friendly","My husband and I always said we'd never go back to the same place twice, but we're going to break our own rule and go back again, to experience this trip again. A fabulous day with excellent hosts, fishing, swimming, eating the catch, washed down with local wine - my idea of heaven. The group's are small enough to be friendly and are really authentic unlike many of the other touristy boat trips. Definitely a 10/10. "

0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/awgy,August 2018,5,Fisherman's Friends,Definitely the best day trip in Zakynthos!We had to get up really early to get our transfer from Vasilikos to the Zante Harbour which was kind of hard for the kids. But what we experienced this day was definitely worth it! The Captain and his friendly crew offered delicious greek coffee and fruit juice. So we enjoyed the morning sun while the authentic and very tidy boat took us out to the fishing ground where we could help throwing out the nets. After a nice stop to swim and relax in the blue waters of a quiet cove we went back to see if we were lucky - and yes it was more than enough for a delicious lunch on the boat with homemade wine and a lot of talking and laughing and (again) swimming in the sea... By the end of the day we knew a lot more about fishing and local life and best of all - we made friends! Thanks a lot Giorgos for that day!
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/433ethand,June 2018,5,Absolutely amazing day out,"This trip is by far one of the best trips I’ve done in my life.loved the trip from start to end, you get to see a lot of places and learn insider knowledge of fishing in Zante.the Captain  is amazing really friendly,all the crew are welcoming. After you catch your fish the cook on board prepares an amazing meal.I don’t usually like fish but this fish was amazing.definitely recommend this to everyone ignore the price and just book it. Well worth it."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alizh3,August 2018,5,Authentic fishing,"We spent two weeks on the island of Zakynthos and this program was by far the best of all those we took part in, We got to know  a little bit of the real Zakynthos though our captain and his crew. Away from the crowd we could spend a day with friendly company and learnt a lot about fishing. Without this trip our holiday would have been less fun, and I also have to mention that for such a price it was well worth it.András, Hungary"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlizHorvath,August 2018,5,Fishing in Zakynthos,"Our family ( two kids, 10 and 13) spent an unforgettable day on ship Panagia in August 2018. Captain Giorgos Nikolatos showed us everything concerning fishing with a net, and he answered our numerous questions with pleasure. We had the best sea food lunch of our life, it was cooked on the ship from the catch of the day, and it was super delicious. Kids loved every minute of the day, especially when they could jump into the water from the ship. We also tried to help with taking the fish out of the net -  pretty tricky, almost like solving a puzzle :)). The ship was perfectly clean, shiny white, so even as a guest we felt very comfortable. I highly recommend this trip to anyone interested in fishing, or for those  who would like to get a little bit deeper knowledge of the place, or the life of Zakynthian people.Aliz from Hungary"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/car0line63,August 2018,5,Zante fishing tours ,"This was one of the highlights of my holiday. It was such a unique experience I will never forget. My friend and I had sole attention of the crew who are a family run enterprise. We started out at sunrise and after a while helped to let down the nets,leaving them for a few hours we swam to Porto Roma for a drink and stroll on the beach. When it was time we hauled in the catch and sat down to eat the lovely feast cooked by Giorgios mother in law. Very happy memories to take home,I highly recommend to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary, thank you ️"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andym452,August 2018,5,Fantastic trip,"This isan experience of a lifetime. We left zante Harbour while the sun was rising and then we stopped to put the fishing nets in the water then we had sone melon and drinks. Then we left the netd behind to go and have a swim at a beautiful secluded beach for a few hours. Then back to the nets to pull them back on board. A very successful catch too with a variety of fish caught including an octopus and a sponge. Then we sailed to another beach for a swim while the fish was prepared on board with wine spaghetti and bread. Absolutely beautiful meal. Giorgos the captain has a great sense of humour and lets you get involved in everything and if you're lucky he might let you stear the boat. Very clean and hygienic which i didn't expect. Couldn't recommend anymore, dont miss out!"
