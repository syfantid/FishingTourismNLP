Hmmm,Normally have a lovely meal and experience at this restaurant having been loads of times. This time however even though the food was just as good the service wasn't so much. We went to celebrate my dad's 84th birthday and the waiters started clearing the table before he had finished eating even trying to clear up the food he was still eating which in turn started to stress him out as he enjoys taking his time in eating what food he has ordered. The table had been booked for 6pm and we felt we were being rushed out and that we weren't welcome and it wasn't even 7.30. Not a good way to treat any customer let alone a regular one.,Date of visit: January 2019,Raipur Indian Cuisine,4,"Pevensey, United Kingdom"
Great fun,Did two rooms - pirates and kidnapped. I haven't done this before so had no idea what to expect. Had so much fun though. First one we did was pirates which we didn't manage to finish even with clues given. We got too involved with one thing which used a lot of time up. Our host Dan did come in and explain what we should have done to finish which was great. The next room was the kidnapped one which we managed a lot better - though had to laugh when some of the clues came as it made somethings so obvious. There were two groups in our crowd and when we were in one room they were doing the other one. Annoyingly they escaped from both rooms and we could hear them cheering while we were still struggling lol. The hosts do a great job. Would definitely go back again.

Amazing as always,"Been coming here for a few years now whenever I visit my parents in pevensey bay and never disappointed. Booked a table last night and glad we did. It was busy even at 6.30. Staff seemed to have changed and I did worry whether the food wouldn't be as good. I needn't. Had salmon tikka to start followed by chicken Shabab. Both as tasty and amazing as before. Very quick service - maybe felt a bit quick sometimes but that would be my only moan. Staff friendly, restaurant clean and a lovely tasty meal.",Date of visit: August 2018,Raipur Indian Cuisine,4,"Pevensey, United Kingdom"
Lovely place for a relaxing holiday,"Rooms decent size and nice and clean with a good sized balcony. Every day bed was made, clean towels left and a general clean up was made. Pool and sunbeds quiet every day so able to relax on a sunbed and have a swim when wanted. Lovely poolside bar serving a good range of drinks and a range of food. Short walk to beach and shops. Lovely relaxed holiday and felt very welcome from the first day. There is a slight hill to the apartments but that helps work off the amazing food you could end up eating in one of the many eateries. The hill also means you get a great view from your room. Can't wait to return",Date of stay: August 2018,Pelagos Apartments Skala,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Gem of a place,Came across this lovely restaurant as we walked to the beach. Lovely views across to the sea. Visited a few times. Sometimes just for a coffee and sometimes for breakfast. My partner had a full English and said it was as good as one he could get in the UK. I had yoghurt with fruit and honey and that was really good. The man serving us every time we went in was very welcoming and lovely. Just a gem of a place just out of the town centre so slightly quieter than other places.,Date of visit: August 2018,Kaliva Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
What an amazing day,Came to kefalonia with 11 others so we had the boat to ourselves. Some of the others had done this before and said it was the best day of their holiday - well I can see why. Felt very welcome from the start. Lovely cake and coffee to welcome us on board. A day of relaxing and amazing food cooked fresh from their catch with swimming and snorkeling off a lovely beach thrown in along with some lovely wine. Could not recommend this day enough,Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Well worth a visit,"Friendly staff, great service and fab prices. Food is amazing. If you want just a coffee and a cake or something more substantial then give here a try. Sit looking out at the river, on a table inside a lovely converted old narrow boat or one of the many tables outside. Definitely a place you can relax. Will be back time and time again",Date of visit: July 2018,Old Boat Cafe,4,"Maidstone, United Kingdom"
