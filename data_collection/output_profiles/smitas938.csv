Absolutely recommend,"The Milos Fishing Trip was the highlight of my vacation in Milos!! Tina and her father are wonderful hosts, and the small group size of 8 made the whole trip very personalized — this was a huge selling point. They also have an awning over the boat, and the shade was incredibly necesary given that it’s an 8-hour tour and (in the summer months) largely in the sun. Other tours weren’t as intimate and didn’t provide shade (and didn’t have the fishing component — which was really cool). Overall, I can’t give enough praise for this amazing tour!! I’d book this fast if you’re interested, as they’re known to sell out.",Date of experience: August 2018,Milos Fishing Trip,5,"Milos, Greece"
