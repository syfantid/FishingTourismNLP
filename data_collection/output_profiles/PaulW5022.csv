Brilliant Day Out,Did the same trip last year and was just as brilliant this year. Fantastic hosts whose home made wine is a treat. Cant get fish fresher than that just pulled out the nets and cooked whilst you swim/snorkel off a secluded beach. Not to be missed,Date of experience: June 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
