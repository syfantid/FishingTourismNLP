Fabulous Meal tonight,"Very busy, had not booked , forgot it was half term. However we were able to get a table, food awesome, service really good, I had the hake and my husband had the sea bass, king prawns and crayfish and macaroni cheese to start. Was Devine, wish we had room for a desert, saw great creations come out of the kitchen, got food
Envy when I saw someone else getting sticky toffee pudding, looked delicious, just had no room. We are lucky only live 2 miles away, so will be back. Thank you Two Clomes",Date of visit: April 2019,Two Clomes,4,"Newquay, United Kingdom"
Roast on the Coast,"Had a fab Sunday lunch here,roast beef and braised beef, plus great veg, two types of cabbage, roasted beetroot, asparagus, broccoli, samphire, roast potatoes, carrots and parsnips plus a Yorkshire, had to then walk it off. Did eight mile walk round the headland and back home. Will be doing it again soon",Date of visit: October 2018,Harbour Fish and Grill,4,"Newquay, United Kingdom"
"This is a must do , do not miss this, best day ever","We met in the harbour at 8 am , it was a lovely day and the sea was lovely and calm.we were welcomed on board by Antonia, who gave us Greek coffee and home made cake. We then went out to sea to pull in the nets that her husband Michaelis had been out and laid at 3 am. The nets go on forever and take over an hour to pull in , but the fish that are caught are very varied and saw fish never seen before.Then the nets are emptied of the fish mainly by Mustapha and Michaelis but you can help if you want? We then stopped at a beautiful spot, where we swam in the clear turquoise waters whilst Antonia prepared Lunch. After lunch there was the opportunity to swim again or fish with rods.The pictures say it all,never have I had fish so fresh and so much, the best lunch and experience of our whole holiday .We eventually made our way back , returning about four thirty. Great value day out with a lovely family, not forgetting the other passengers on the boat who also made the day enjoyable.
You will not be disappointed",Date of experience: June 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Lovely resturant, lovely people good food","We were staying a short walk from this restaurant and were in Svoronata for a month, we ate here on our second night. however after the first week , we ended up eating here probably three times a week for dinner. The views are great, and the sunset from the restaurant balcony are stunning, also the planes taking off and landing so close is another attraction but it is the food that brings you back.Fraddos the owner comes round with the fresh fish of the day to show you and tells you what the specials of the day are. Sea bream stuffed with spinach and prawns, swordfish souvlaki, fresh tuna steaks. Also great steaks, pork and chicken souvlaki. The atmosphere is relaxed, we were never rushed, all the staff were friendly and welcoming, can't recommend this place enough",Date of visit: June 2017,O Milos,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Beautiful Beach Taverna , with good fresh food","Food very good, specials of the day include rabbit, fresh fish , chicken souvlaki. Very informal, spending the day on the beach and then when you are hungry just wander up and chose a table. I imagine though can get very busy in high season.Salads are very good and always given a complimentary desert sometimes fresh fruit or cake , lovely place to take in bueatiful beachside location",Date of visit: June 2017,To Enetiko,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"The most beautiful site,","On arrival we were welcomed to the site and escorted to our pitch which was in full sunshine with a grass area and hard standing. The warden was lovely and told us the price was for the pitch and we could put up awnings pop tents etc without any extra charge. We walked around the whole site the lakes are beautiful , and just outside the campsite is a walk down to the beach , traffic free into Combe Martin. The birds are lovely and the bird song is beautiful, but the facility's are the best I have experienced in a long time.Free hot showers, in bathrooms with sinks and toilets, all self contained. The washing up sinks are inside and like the rest of the facility's are all heated, However the main attraction of this site is the beauty of it , and you can walk the coastal path to ilfracombe and ge the bus back, a great day out. Will we be returning, on yes definitely.",Date of stay: May 2017,Newberry Valley Caravan & Camping Park,4,"Combe Martin, United Kingdom"
"Lovely meal , log fires and good wine","We booked a table, on arrival we found it was in front of the log burner, so lovely and warm, shared a fish platter to start, then I had the duck and my husband had the beef, bacon and Stilton, pie, lovely puff pastry, vegetables were fab and my red cabbage that came with the duck and cherry sauce excellent. I had no room for pudding but my husband had the cheese board and it was so huge I had to share it with him. Lush xxx
Will be going back to try Sunday lunch and Wednesday pie night . Very nice atmosphere and as we are local might become a regular if the standard continues on our next visits",Date of visit: November 2016,Smugglers Den Inn,4,"Cubert, United Kingdom"
"Great location, Lovely staff, comfy and clean","we stayed for four nights in july and returned for four nights in August, all the staff were freindly and helpful . Breakfast was great , lots of fresh fruit, cereals,also cooked breakfast every day, serve yourself and have as much or as little as you like. Hotel also provide a kitchen for your use,this means that you can eat at the hotel in the evening should you wish, they supply all the plates etc, you just wash up afterwards. we had a cream tea one wet afternoon in the hotel , as everywhere in newquay was crammed and it was nice to come back and relax in the conservatory area. car park can be challenging but we always got a space , but great location so you can walk into newquay in the evening and dont have to worry about finding a parking space in the town. Rooms are quirky we stayed in several different rooms as we did a last minute trip and rang up to see if we could get in again as we liked it so much the first time.John the owner was able to help but it meant we had to take several different rooms, so we had sea views , side views and
a very retro bathroom (carpeted up the bath).It all added to the experience.All rooms were clean and beds very comfortable.
However the staff and owners are the people who make this hotel and nothing is too much trouble .So thank to john and your team
we enjoyed it so much have booked a weekend in september.",Date of stay: August 2015,The Glendeveor,4,"Newquay, United Kingdom"
"Amazing atmosphere, lovely staff, great steak","Tried to get a table in july, fully booked, but came down again in august, and just got lucky, walked in and showed to a lovely little alcove table , candles on table , really nice waitresses, orded rare rump steak and it was delicious",Date of visit: August 2015,Captain Jack's,4,"Newquay, United Kingdom"
Amazing spider crab,"Booked a table for friday evening as we walked past at lunchtime and saw the chef take two spider crabs from the tanks and walk through to the kitchen with them.so you know its fresh.we asked for a trable outside on the balcony . My husband and I shared the mussel starter and then I had spider crab and he had crab claws, two very messy hours later we left the resturant very happy, very informal relaxing dining experience, excellent value for money, spider crab was huge and my husband could not finish all of his crab claws.will be back next time we are in newquay.",Date of visit: August 2015,The Boathouse - Street Food on the Beach,4,"Newquay, United Kingdom"
Fantastic start to our holiday,"We are here on our first night in Polis,we both had the fish meze, the food never stopped coming , lovely starters olives , salad, hummus , Taramasalata, thanni,and pitta, the fish meze boasts 18 dishes so we worked out we had had 6 , but no then they brought out the fish, two dishes at a time, so it was all hot as we were eating it ,too many types to mention but the best was the sea bass and the cod ,then when we had finished after a litre of village red at 6 euros, we were then brought melon and cake follow by coffee. However it's not just the food ,its the relaxed atmosphere in a lovely location and as others have mentioned you are not rushed in fact it feels like the hosts would be happy for you to sit outside all night.Enjoyed it so much went back last night andhad the most massive lamb kleftico which was just perfect, my husband had the fish platter which was nearly as good as the mezze, just less dishes, again more cake followed by complimentary liquers.
We will be returning again as sitting outside in the courtyard was so relaxing and want to try other specials on the menu.",Date of visit: June 2015,Mikis Tavern,4,"Polis, Cyprus"
Fantastic Holiday,"We stayed here for a month in September.Nothing is too much trouble if you want anything Caroline will provide it if she can.Large rooms all with balconies, cleaned every day,clean towels provided twice a week, Bar open all the time, food served all day.Greek barbeque excellent, dancing, music and great food, great value at 12 euros.Yes it is a walk into sadari but it is set in beautiful country side and does not have the lots of bars and hassle that you get on the strip.I have been to corfu 3 times and this was the best hotel for customer experience and service.we loved it, and will recommend to anybody who will listen to us.",Date of stay: September 2014,Goudelis Apartments,4,"Corfu, Greece"
awful,Food overpriced everything far too salty.cannot understand why people go there at all.much better food available within a3k radius,Date of visit: July 2014,Alandalus,4,"Calasparra, Spain"
"Great value,Great flavours",We saw the reviews on Trip advisor and were staying nearby and decided to try the menu del dia at 10 Euro's each.Starters of sea food paella and a veal stew with French fries were huge and served with the best salad I've had in Spain since we got here 3 weeks ago.This was followed by generous pork and chicken dishes and then whisky cake and chocolate profiteroles.Two hours later we left the resturant ready for our afternoon siesta.We will be returning another time to try out the evening menu.,Date of visit: July 2014,Gastro-Bar Matavinos,4,"Valentin, Spain"
"Fantastic experience,","Ate here just before Christmas and had a great lunch on 23rd December, excellent menu to choose from, had three courses. real kick start to christmas . food excellent service great came back for sunday lunch after christmas. Really really good. will return soon",Date of visit: December 2013,Bistro 1709,4,"Lichfield, United Kingdom"
The best location for a mobile home we have ever had,"We could get up in the morning and walk straight onto the beach. Indoor heated pool was great. Accomodation good, only downside where the beds , mattresses covered in plastic and sheets far to big for the small mattresses which meant that during the night you slid off the bed,this was the only downside, however really enjoyed the fact that the site was out of season, not too sure how i would feel about this site if it was full as feel facilities would become overcrowded",Date of stay: May 2012,Pentewan Sands Holiday Park,4,"Pentewan, United Kingdom"
The Best Sunday Lunch for Miles,"We went for a family meal out, 6 adults a two year old and a four year old... The sunday lunch menu has a set menu to choose from, Fabulous starters, Traditional roast, but also sea bass , steak and ale pie , and many more. There is also a Speacials Board which often features game. We had a fantastic meal it was speacial to us as our Daughter and boyfriend were about to go travelling so it was a sort of celebration and a goodbye,so we did'nt want to rush. The atmosphere was just right, the landlady always gives great attention to detail. we stayed till long after the meal was over, moving into the bar area which is furnished with soft comfy leather sofa's to have coffee's, some of us with a little extra added.",Date of visit: January 2012,White Lion,4,"Tamworth, United Kingdom"
"Lovely Old Pub, with new people trying very hard, Good homecooked food","We went for lunch and we were the only people there, don't let it put you off, The new landlady welcomed us and put more logs on the log burner. The menu is simple and resonably priced, but the food when it came was good. For us the bonus was that they also had board games to help yourself to, so we ate our lunch and spent the afternoon drinking wine and playing scrabble.",Date of visit: February 2012,Old Albion Inn,4,"Crantock, United Kingdom"
THE BEST INDIAN RESTURANT IN THE MIDLANDS,"we have been eating here for the last 2 years, at least twice a month. The staff are welcoming, the food is excellent and they will try and accomodate individual tastes. My recomendations are the tandouri fish starter which is a whole trout, but the rest are also all good. The naan bread is fabulous, i love fish dishes and not all indian resturants offer that much choice, they have a great menu.I have never had a bad meal here . I recommend that a booking at the weekend will secure your table as very popular and they do have to turn people away.",Date of visit: February 2012,Nessa's,4,"Walsall, United Kingdom"
we live nearby and go several times a year,"Excellent picnic areas, the grounds have fabulous walks, the house is very interesting, the underground tunnels are very exciting , one of the best family days out you could have, probably expensive if you have to pay, I have national tust cards so therefore don't notice the cost, but even so if you just pay to park you have acess to the grounds which means you can see almost everything except the house. I forgot to mention the deer which are near the picnic area. This is one of the best national Trust properties that I have visited.",,Calke Abbey,4,"Ticknall, United Kingdom"
This is the best ever free museum that I have been to.,"A day is not long enough to see all that is here. Ever changing exhibits, interactive and interesting for all.",,Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery,4,"Birmingham, United Kingdom"
This is my favourite place in Florida,"Food is excellent, service is good ,I am always on holiday when we visit so we are never in a hurry, the location is magical. We have been coming here for 5 years and it is always the highlight of my holiday. So much of floridas eating places are dark air conditioned, and without a feeling of individuality, this for me is like mediterranean dining but with florida menus and laid back dining.
Great specials that allow value for money, but also more sophisticated menu if you are happy to pay. A must if you like oysters, and their bloody mary cocktails with an oyster included are an exerience in themself.",Date of visit: May 2011,Waterfront Restaurant & Marina,4,"Saint James City, Florida"
Great food,"Had a great experience here on a sunday lunchtime, very busy but space was made for all and service welcoming. My husband wanted a roast and was not disappointed. He had moist tender pork with crackling, and i just love game. The venision casserole was wonderful served with cheddar mash, the vegetables were impressive not the usual peas and carrots, I was delighted to find we were served with roasted butternut squash,mange tout and red cabbage. A really good meal , I just wished I had room for a pudding as I would have demolished the triple choc Brownie, however much too full, next time, and there will be a next time I will make sure that i have a lighter lunch so I can appreiciate the pudding menu",Date of visit: September 2011,Devonshire Arms,4,"Hartington, United Kingdom"
