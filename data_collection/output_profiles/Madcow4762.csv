Delightful meal and great atmosphere,We ate here last night. Delightful meal. We had suckling pig and Greek salad. Very pleasant atmosphere. Would definitely recommend this place:),Date of visit: July 2019,Taka Taka,4,"Paxos, Greece"
Hidden Gem of a restaurant at Moggonisi Beach,We dined here whilst making an unscheduled overnight stay at Mongonissi Beach. What an absolute gem of a place. Fairly unassuming from the outside but the food and service was out of this world. I asked what the recommended dish was and went for tuna. My sons had octopus but different dishes. Husband had pizza. All dishes were exemplary and I have continued to rave about them all week! Luckily for us there may be the opportunity to return next week with friends and if so we will definitely repeat the experience! Can not recommend this place highly enough!,Date of visit: July 2019,Carnayo Gold Lounge Cafè,4,"Paxos, Greece"
Kinney Lake Walk a must!,"We did the walk to Kinney Lake which is in an easy trail next to the river. Along the trail are glimpses of spectacular Mount Robson. We had the Lake virtually to ourselves, and it was absolutely stunning. A definite recommendation if you are visiting the Provincial Park. There are other walks on the area, details can be obtained at the Visitor Centre.",Date of experience: October 2018,Mount Robson Provincial Park and Protected Area,4,"British Columbia, Canada"
Beach Day/ Cocktails,Pleasant ( uncrowded) beach with easy and plentiful parking. An array of cocktail bars and restaurants along the promenade and Lorraine’s set above and back a bit from the beach. We didn’t eat here but know people who have. Sunloungers available or plenty of room to pitch your own parasol. Predominantly sand with some shingle. Worth a visit if you are in the area or just wanting to explore.,Date of experience: June 2018,Lourdas (Lourdata) Beach,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Low key meal for two,Popped in here for a mellow meal out. Lovely sea view and easy access. Very reasonably priced meal and friendly staff. I had the mousaka and a Greek salad. Husband had the Kefalonia meat pie.,Date of visit: July 2018,Casa de Blue Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
5*Only way to describe this trip,"Stunning day out with the lovely Efi and Dimitri. Meet the boat at beautiful Kateleios harbour at 8am. Welcome aboard by charming hosts Efi and Dimitri. Motor out to bring in the nets and help as much or as little as you wish to untangle the catch of the day. Swim and Zumba the at your leisure whilst Efi and Dimitri prepare sumptuous lunch on board. Beer and wine and soft drinks are all included also try the Grappa! Another swim or a snooze before heading home, back to the harbour by 3pm. Tips for the trip: wear non slip boat shoes whilst on board. Take sunscreen although there is shade on the boat. If you are prone to seasickness take a Stugeron tablet an hour or so before the trip. The boat can be a bit rocky whilst the nets are being hauled in. Can not recommend this trip highly enough. Without a doubt it was the best day of our holiday. Efi and Dimitri make you feel more like family than tourists!!! A must do whilst in kefalonia !!!",Date of experience: July 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Impromptu lunch,"Called in here whilst exploring by car. Admittedly we were attracted by the stunning beach. We relaxed on cushions whilst waiting for our lunch. Service was friendly and prompt although we had hit a quiet period and were virtually the only people there. The beach was stunning, and the views surreal. It was the perfect chill out opportunity and I would definitely recommend this place.",Date of experience: January 2018,Rum Bus Beach,4,Antigua
Beach ride and swim with lovely horses,"I opted for the two and a half hour ride as I was keen to ride to Rendezvous Bay. Kent was my charming and entertaining escort and I rode the lovely Joy. We rode along a track through lush vegetation and with stunning views to Rendezvous Bay where we cantered the horses along the beach before untacking and taking them into the sea for a swim. I haven’t ridden bareback for years so this was a fantastic experience and Joy was wonderfully obliging and comfortable too!
I would definitely recommend this ride if you are an experienced rider. Wear swim wear under your riding clothes, long trousers a must to prevent pinching from the tack, and I wore trainers. A towel is also recommended. Hats are supplied and also a very welcome drink at the beach. Kent and Susie were excellent hosts and the horses are well cared for. Thanks too Kent for enabling my husband to accompany us on your bike!",Date of experience: January 2018,Springhill Riding Club,4,Antigua
Live Music and Excellent service,"Visited here for live music and dinner with friends on Thursday night. Superb location overlooking Half Moon Bay. Excellent service and we were even collected from our residence and taxied back at the end of the evening. Superb atmosphere and food: we had lobster and Mahi Mahi. Delicious. Friendly staff, especially the lovely Peaches...can not recommend this place highly enough.",Date of visit: February 2018,Beach Bum Bar and Grill,4,Antigua
Little piece of paradise,"Visit this island either by private charter, or various tours stop here for snorkelling/lunch. You can visit by Boat from Nonsuch Bay which is free for hotel guests or 15USD for non residents. Good and safe snorkelling, take sunscreen, water and an underwater camera. Various pristine white sandy beaches and colours are out of this world. Water is clear and calm and protected by the reef.",Date of experience: February 2018,Green Island,4,Antigua
Excellent Kite Surfing school,Husband had completed basic kite surfing course in UK and was wanting to progress further in warmer waters. He booked two sessions 2 1/2 hours each with an instructor and progressed massively in these sessions. Excellent one on one instruction from boat in safe waters with good breeze. Friendly accommodating staff. Perfect environment in which to develop your skills. Highly recommended.,Date of experience: February 2018,"40knots - kiteboarding, wing surfing school",4,Antigua
Enjoyable Experience,"Friendly welcoming staff and locals, great service, and delicious dinner on Saturday night, do not be put off by the decor. This place is under new ownership ( June 2015) and is a gem in the making. We were so impressed we came back to enjoy a delicious Sunday roast, choice of lamb, chicken, beef or pork, all generous well presented portions, and really tasty! Lovely sea views, as this place is practically on the beach! We were glad to be inside due to inclement weather, but will be back to visit in the summer. Cannot comment on the accommodation, but if the food and service is anything to go by I would say this is a safe bet. One room has a balcony overlooking the sea. Looking forward to revisiting and to see how this place develops! Oh and dog friendly too:)",Date of stay: February 2016,Coombe Barton Inn,4,"Crackington Haven, United Kingdom"
Beachside coffee stop,Beachside cafe serving snacks and lunches. Delicious latte and friendly service. A welcome escape from the elements!,Date of visit: February 2016,Haven Cafe,4,"Crackington Haven, United Kingdom"
Well located waterside pub,"Pleasant enough evening. Ate here whilst on a narrow boat holiday. Nice setting and morning nearby but get here early as this is a popular spot in the summer amongst boaters and locals. Food was good and well received after a long day. Friendly staff and service, but to me this pub is unremarkable and lacks the more personal touch of a family run local.",Date of visit: July 2015,Poachers,4,"Chirk, United Kingdom"
Accommodating staff. Delicious meal. Dog friendly.,"We were recommended this pub as a place to eat whilst on our recent narrow boat holiday. Having enjoyed a cheeky lock side cider whilst our ""crew"" were navigating the boat through the lock, we decided to come back on our return journey. We phoned ahead to book as our anticipated arrival time was going to be near 9 pm, staff were accommodating to say the least, taking our order bang on 9 pm, and the food was generously portioned and delicious! No complaints from this quarter! Waterside mooring near the pub, and endless activity of boats going through the lock to keep you amused. Clean play area for children and dog friendly too. Highly recommended.",Date of visit: July 2015,Willeymoor Lock Tavern,4,"Bradeley Green, United Kingdom"
"Great location, friendly staff, delicious food.",Ate here recently and we were so impressed by the whole experience! Just outstanding. Would not hesitate to recommend and aleady planning to return!,Date of visit: March 2015,Cote Brasserie - Exeter,4,"Exeter, United Kingdom"
Delicious home made breakfast!,"We spent three nights here in March and whilst we could have opted for a city centre hotel, we chose The Old Rectory due to its proximity to Queens University and on Trip Advisor reviews. We weren't disappointed. Our room was spacious and comfortable. Mary could not have been more helpful, even making us delicious sandwiches and booking a taxi for an early flight. Breakfasts are home cooked and delicious! A huge thank you for making us so welcome on our first trip to Belfast.",Date of stay: March 2015,Old Rectory,4,"Belfast, United Kingdom"
"Absolutely Outstanding, A MUST if you are visiting Belfast!","I booked this tour for our recent trip to Belfast. Sam, our driver gave us a fascinating tour, and brought the history of The Troubles to life, with sound facts, and knowledge, and sharing personal anecdotes which had us riveted for the entire afternoon. Great communication throughout whilst I was planning our visit. I would wholeheartedly recommend this company as a number one activity if you are visiting Belfast.",Date of experience: March 2015,Paddy Campbell's Belfast Famous Black Cab Tours,4,"Belfast, United Kingdom"
Well worth a visit,"Well worth a visit especially the section on Ireland's history and the photographic displays. Free, optional donation on admission. Recommended.",Date of experience: March 2015,Ulster Museum,4,"Belfast, United Kingdom"
Beautiful buildings and close to the Ulster museum,Worth incorporating if you are visiting the museum. We had a personal interest as our son is a student there. Beautiful buildings and right next to Ulster museum and Botanic gardens.,Date of experience: March 2015,Queen's University,4,"Belfast, United Kingdom"
Worth a gander if you have the time,"Lovely to wander around, and delightful spring flower display when we were there. Located beside Queens University and near the Ulster museum, approx 20 minutes walk from City Centre.",Date of experience: March 2015,Botanic Gardens,4,"Belfast, United Kingdom"
Worth every penny! Fascinating!,"We spent a whole afternoon here, well displayed, imaginative, and definitely worth visiting. We were enthralled. Thoroughly recommended. Would appeal to all ages.",Date of experience: March 2015,Titanic Belfast,4,"Belfast, United Kingdom"
Not to be missed,Beautiful old buildings and architecture. We wandered through taking in the magnificence and soaked up the atmosphere. Plenty of watering holes too if you are in need of refreshment.,Date of experience: March 2015,Cathedral Quarter,4,"Belfast, United Kingdom"
Beautiful Building,We just admired this building from the outside whilst walking around the city. Beautiful architecture and worth a detour.,Date of experience: March 2015,City Hall,4,"Belfast, United Kingdom"
Great for live sport,Watched the Ireland Wales game (Six Nations) here. Great atmosphere. Cannot comment on the food as we did not eat but beer and cider were fine and it was a great place to watch the game.,Date of visit: March 2015,The Botanic Inn,4,"Belfast, United Kingdom"
Great for live music,"Brilliant night here listening to Irish band, Hyland Paddy. Good atmosphere, and would definitely recommend for live music.",Date of experience: March 2015,Fibber Magees,4,"Belfast, United Kingdom"
Well located hotel with off road parking,"We stayed here for one night whilst attending a function in Bristol. Hotel was the most reasonably priced, and we had a large room with an extremely comfortable bed. Warm friendly service and my bag was carried up to the room for me which I thought was a nice touch. Bargain £5 breakfast to see us on our way. Overall a good stay. The only reason I have not given 5 stars is that the shower was a bit pathetic, but for the rate, we will definitely be back.",Date of stay: January 2015,Victoria Square Hotel,4,"Bristol, United Kingdom"
You will not find better accommodation on Poros!,"The apartments are superb, spacious and spotlessly clean, view lovely, lots of areas to sit in pretty Greek courtyard or have a snack at the adjoining restaurant, but what makes Odyssey stand head and shoulders over any other accommodation in Poros is Katerina, the hostess, who as other reviewers have said, goes out of her way to ensure that each guest feels valued and has a wonderful holiday experience. The number of returning guests are testimony to the outstanding hospitality at Odyssey Apartments. We visited with our teenage sons, and hired scooters from the bike hire up the road, which gave us transport all over the island. The boys were able to discover the nightlife and had a great time and we were able to totally relax. We went with other guests to a local island for the day, by boat. Katerina and her staff organised a picnic lunch and wine and we had a really fun day, not returning until sunset! We also visited the local open air cinema, and during our stay, Katerina ensured that we knew if there were any local events which may interest us. She could not have been more kind and generous. We went for the all inclusive package on meals, and we ate heartily. Evening meals especially were delicious, especially as this place is also run as a cookery school. To vary our venue, Katerina arranged for us to eat at her brother's restaurant overlooking Poros town one night. Apartments are also well equipped for self catering and there is a supermarket just up the road. You can eat in the adjoining restaurant on an occasional basis. Our every need was attended to, and I would love to return to do some cookery and sea kayaking one day! Thank you again, Katerina and her staff for looking after us so well.",Date of stay: July 2013,Odyssey Suites,4,"Poros, Greece"
Meze Meze - A whole experience,"We had a superb evening here, it is a short distance along the quayside from the main town, and most definitely worth the detour. Luckily enough, we were berthed nearby. We were given a warm welcome by Katerina, the Swedish hostess, and sampled a whole range of delicious dishes. The portions are generous, and to be honest, we did not really need the main meal on top of the meze courses, however everything was homemade and well cooked and presented, and more importantly, delicious! We we're also treated to exceptionally good live music by Demos, the proprietor, on guitar and bouzouki. The whole family ( teenagers as well), enjoyed the Meze Meze experience.Good food and affordable prices, in a warm and hospitable setting.",Date of visit: July 2013,Meze Meze,4,"Poros, Greece"
A blend of locals and tourists in a traditional setting,"This is a traditional Greek beach with a few tourist attractions such as tubing and parascending from the watersports pier.However these are unobtrusive if you just want to chill. A clean and well maintained strip of beach with easy parking and access from the road, sun loungers (2.5 € ) are available. Safe swimming and paddling. A great place to sit and people watch as this beach is also frequented by local families. There is a beach bar and nearby tavernas. Can be busy in the middle of the day, but we pitched up around 3 or 4 pm to catch the afternoon and early evening sun which was perfect.",Date of experience: July 2013,Askeli Beach,4,"Poros, Greece"
Nagi of Mekong,"Maybe a year out of date, but time to reflect on highlights of last year's SEA trip, and Nagi of Mekong ranks high on my list. This is a great affordable way to cruise down the Mekong river from Huay Xai to Luang Prabang . We were travelling as a family with four teenage sons, and this was a great way to spend a couple of days meandering along the Mekong river, relaxing and recharging our batteries. We were collected from our hotel (Teakhouse Garden) in Thailand and escorted across the river to Huay Xai. 35$ per person for a Laos visa, and a bit of a skirmish at the border due to crowds, but half an hour later, we were aboard the Nagi and set for our trip south. We shared our trip with a Dutch family and several other travellers, probably about 14 in total. Lunch was served aboard the Nagi, and prepared on board. Excellent. A stop en route at a local village and the opportunity to purchase local crafts. Please observe etiquette when taking pictures of these villagers. They are not a tourist attraction. On to overnight at a basic but perfectly comfortable hotel in Pak Bang. Worth a walk through this town away from the riverside. On the following day to Luang Prabang, stopping off at another local village and later the Pak Ou caves. We walked to our accomodation in L.P. but think tuk tuk may be included in the price. At all times, Adisak answered my emails promptly, and was helpful and efficient. His daughter even met us at the airport in Thailand with bus tickets for our overnight journey to the hotel, all organised by Adisak. Would thoroughly recommend Nagi of Mekong and Adisak as a reliable and affordable way of travelling along the Mekong. His email is; adisak.star@gmail.com",Date of experience: August 2012,Mekong River,4,"Tha Heua, Laos"
Most worthwhile visit during our stay in Vientiane,"A year on, and still reflecting on the visit we made to the COPE visitor centre. This place is a short journey from the centre of Vientiane. We went by scooter. Our family of six ( four teenage sons) were educated and informed during our visit. Like many people on this site, we had no idea of the extent and aftermath of the bombing and of the work which is so important and still ongoing. Entry is free. Excellent informative documentary film. There are opportunities to donate to this worthy cause and this visit left a lasting impression on all of us. Please support this if you are visiting Vientiane.",Date of experience: August 2012,COPE Visitor Centre,4,"Vientiane, Laos"
Affordable sailing with a professional family run company,"Sailing at its best! We returned this morning from a wonderful week sailing in the Saronic Gulf having chartered a yacht through Greek Sails. How's that for a speedy review!! This is a family run outfit who really know what they are doing. The yachts are immaculately clean and well equipped, and local knowledge from Andreas was most useful when planning our route. Administration, managed by Sue, was efficient and friendly, and attention to detail second to none. I will have no hesitation in recommending these guys to friends back home, we will certainly be back for a return trip. Thank you team for a great holiday:)",Date of experience: July 2013,Greek Sails Yacht Charters,4,"Poros, Greece"
"A "" Must see"" if you are visiting Athens","Not to be missed, this piece of ancient history. Try to visit early. Ticket office opens at 8 am. You will beat the heat and the crowds... Remember to take passports as proof of age for teens and student cards as under 18s and students go free. Entry is 12 € per person. This ticket entitles you to entry to other historic sites around Athens. Take plenty of water and hat/ sunglasses for protection from the heat, and wear sturdy walking shoes or trainers. Amazing views and absolutely fascinating, something there for everybody.",Date of experience: July 2013,Acropolis,4,"Athens, Greece"
Good location on a budget,"This hotel was a great choice for a family on a one night visit to Athens. Rooms are basic, with ceiling fan but you can ask for air con. What more than made up for this was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. They went out of their way to show us places to visit and also places to be avoided. Location was great and although breakfast was not included, there are numerous places to eat within spitting distance, on your way to the Acropolis. Another big plus was the convenient location to the metro, which made our onward journey to Piraeus very easy.
Would definitely recommend if your expectations are not too high.",Date of stay: July 2013,Marble House,4,"Athens, Greece"
Hidden Gem,"I cannot believe the discrepancy of reviews for this restaurant. My husband and I visited this restaurant last night, and had an excellent meal from the set menu at around £14 pp. We had delicious starters of onion bahajis and mains of lamb madras. The deal included a pint of Kingfisher and a glass of house wine for me. The portions and the flavouring were spot on. I think this meal was exceptional value for the centre of Bristol. Service was very good, discreet but attentive, and the place was spotless. Why isn't this place full every night? Location is maybe a little off centre, but I think this is part of its charm, and personally, I like to discover places which are slightly off the beaten track . Have a visit and make your own judgement. We will definitely be going back.",Date of visit: June 2013,Namaste Nepal,4,"Bristol, United Kingdom"
Fun atmosphere. Multi cultural food. No limit on portions. Good value.,"I ate here for the first time with a group of varying ages. Food was far better than I was expecting for a buffet. Chef cooks choice of scallops, salmon, steak, or king prawns while you wait, then fill up your plate from the many choices ; Chinese, Indian, European, Thai, it is all there. No limit on how much you can eat, but save some room for the desserts. Wine was reasonably priced and very good. Great place to go in a group, staff efficient and service perfectly adequate. I will definitely be visiting again.",Date of visit: May 2013,Cosmo,4,"Bristol, United Kingdom"
Excellent Yorkshire hospitality,"My friend booked me in here with other guests and family members for a family celebration in the function room. What an excellent choice of venue and accommodation. Helpful friendly staff and good food and wine, from a menu offering a wide selection of choices. My only difficulty was choosing what to have! Purpose built accommodation across the car park, only a few yards to walk back to after a fun filled night. Comfortable bed and Yorkshire tea and other beverages available in the room made my stay complete. Would have preferred a room without a skylight as I am an early waker, but will know to ask another time, as rooms with conventional windows are available. Off for a walk to enjoy some fresh Yorkshire air before tucking into a hearty breakfast. Sad not to be staying another night, but hope to be back. Thanks to John and his staff.",Date of stay: April 2013,The Village Inn,4,"Brompton, United Kingdom"
Cracking night out. Warm friendly staff. Good food.,"Need I say more? We had a superb night out here with friends, and acquaintances, and the staff were warm, friendly and accommodating. We were a group of about 14, and the service was excellent. I had the filet steak which was cooked to perfection. Would highly recommend this restaurant.",Date of visit: March 2013,Le Husky,4,"Les Contamines-Montjoie, France"
Excellent quiet ski resort. No queues. Something for everyone.,"I stayed here in March and as it was between school holidays we experienced no queues, and often had the piste virtually to ourselves. Good range of slopes from beginner to intermediate, and good off piste for more advanced. Also Nordic skiing facilities in the valley and reasonable snowboarding although I cannot speak from experience as I am not a snowboarder, but people I met seemed to enjoy it. Mainly chair lifts once you get up the mountain, and I imagine these could be bitterly cold in adverse conditions. All staff friendly and welcoming. Good variety of restaurants up the mountain. Very impressed. Quiet resort at bottom of gondola, but perfectly adequate and if you need more night life, stay in Les Contamines proper, where there is a courtesy bus during the day to the gondola.",Date of experience: March 2013,Les Contamines-Montjoie Ski Resort,4,"Les Contamines-Montjoie, France"
Fresh fish and authentic eating,"Great roadside shack serving the most delicious fresh fish at incredibly reasonable prices. Queue at portacabin and order your fish from a selection of catch of the day. The choice was humour or sherri or king fish, coupled with prawns. Wait outside and when your meal is ready ( about 20 minutes), go and sit at al fresco, no frills table and chairs and enjoy the flavours. We had sherri fish and prawns, cooked to perfection in a curry sauce, and paratha bread, salad, and soft drinks for 180 aed in total for three of us. Excellent value, but as mentioned in a previous review, not for those who like fine dining in smart surroundings. This is a much more traditional and rustic experience. I will definitely be back.",Date of visit: December 2012,Bu Qtair Fish Restaurant,4,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
Great views for sunset junkies,"Happy hour from 5-8. Passion fruit mojhitos. Great views of Burg al Arab, and other views of Dubai watching the sun go down and listening to cool music. Great location near to the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, a definite must do if you are visiting Dubai.",,360,4,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
Authentic food in a street setting,"We went to Ravi restaurant in Satwa, and the food was amazing. Street side setting, so do not go if you like all the trimmings, but we were looked after very well by the staff and had a delicious meal of Chicken tikka, lamb jalfreizi, and another chicken dish, spinach and daal, and gorgeous yummy paratha bread and steamed rice. The atmosphere was buzzing, and busy, and I would definitely recommend this if you want a more authentic experience and delicious cuisine.",Date of visit: December 2012,Ravi's,4,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
Fabulous setting right next to the Clifton Suspension Bridge and Avon Gorge,"Pleasant stay here in transit and moving house. Very accommodating as we arrived with horrific amounts of luggage which they kindly stored for us in the wine cellar. Although there was a wedding going on as we arrived we were not disturbed at all by the noise. Good restaurant, very good breakfast, and helpful staff. Room was facing the street, but comfortable although could do with a refurb. They allowed me to bring my two dogs which I thought was unbelievable in this day and age and therefore they get a big thumbs up from me!",Date of stay: September 2012,Avon Gorge by Hotel du Vin,4,"Bristol, United Kingdom"
"Affordable, nice ambience","Took our family here for supper. Beer 14,000 VD a Tiger. Food good, substantial and filling, and tasted good too. Nice staff and friendly atmosphere. Definitely recommended for those on a budget.",,Gecko,4,"Hanoi, Vietnam"
"Fascinating, a must see...","We visited the War Remnants museum in an afternoon having spent the morning at the Cu Chi tunnels. An absorbing couple of hours seeing things from the Vietnamese perspective. Some outstanding photographic exhibits and although harrowing, cannot be ignored as this is so much a part of this country's history. An absolute must see if you are in this part of the world.
The displays are well put together, and do not miss the garden exhibits too, pretty gruesome in parts, but this is not a light hearted place. Our four teenage sons were equally fascinated, and could have stayed longer.",,War Remnants Museum,4,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"
Great hairdresser even if you are just passing through...,"I booked an appointment at Concept Coiffure having read good reports on TA and I was not disappointed. I am travelling with my family, and knew that I could not cope with root regrowth, and so booked myself in whilst in Saigon for a couple of nights. I arrived by moto taxi in the pouring rain, not quite appreciating the distance from district 1 to 2, but I felt relaxed and well looked after, and my hair.... Great!!!! Sandrine followed my request and matched the colour beautifully, and I would absolutely recommend them 100 per cent.",,Concept Coiffure,4,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"
A must see half day trip from Saigon,"We visited the tunnels on a private tour with Buffalo Tours. Not the cheapest, but we felt we had very good value For money. Our guide, Lam was able to tell us all sorts of things, not only about the tunnels but also about Vietnam, and economy, culture, and many gems of information not found in tourist guides. The tunnels were fascinating, and our teenage sons enjoyed the ""hands on"" experience. We all managed to squeeze into the tunnel, deliberately built to accommodate western sizes, and the visit really makes you appreciate just how tough and resourceful the Vietnamese were. I felt mildly claustrophobic going into the tunnel for a brief period, but imagine living down these tunnels for months/ years... Incredible. A good movie at the end to cap it all off, and the opportunity to pay huge amounts of money and fire live bullets, which obviously appealed to our teenage element.
I would definitely recommend shopping around for tours, especially if you are on a budget, as these are widely available from Saigon. We paid $ 21 per person.",,Cu Chi Tunnels,4,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"
Fab fab fab,"We did the half day tour with Leanne as our guide. I rode pillion with my husband and the rest of the family rode individually. True to other readers comments, this tour should not be undertaken without some riding experience. We rode through lovely countryside, and Leanne occasionally pointed out things of interest, with a few gems of information thrown in which was really interesting. The bikes are full of character, and fun to ride. There was minimal driving through the traffic, but the main part Watson minor country roads and tracks, the grand finale was crossing the wooden bridge as advertised! Leanne was empathetic to my photographic needs , and made a few stops at key places. The whole family LOVED this trip. They are still raving about it!! So thanks to all the team, and I hope we will ride again with you in the future .",,Hoi An Motorbike Adventures,4,"Hoi An, Vietnam"
Convenient clean hotel in the heart of Chau Doc,"We stayed in this small bet convenient hotel for one night whilst transiting through from Cambodia. We had the balcony room, overlooking the market. Our sons had twin rooms. I must say, this hotel is excellent value, offering clean and compact but perfectly adequate rooms. Staff were helpful, and I organised an excellent boat tour of the floating market and local houses which was very reasonable. I also organised onward transport by bus to Can Tho. I was charged $6 per person, $2 more than the bus fare per person and was told this was the fee for the hotel pick up. I later found out that pick up is free by that particular bus company. My fault for being gullible. Good wifi connection in lobby. Would recommend this hotel, just be savvy about bus tickets. We were also scammed big time by the rickshaw drivers, but that's another story!",Date of stay: August 2012,Trung Nguyen Hotel,4,"Chau Doc, Vietnam"
An untouristy gem.,"We stayed with Hung following information I received on Trip Advisor. First impressions were not overwhelming, as the rooms were adequate but basic, and we opted for the riverside on our first night. We went on the (very)early morning tour with Hung, who turned out to be such a fantastic tour guide, so passionate about his local area, and very knowledgable about rice, watermelons, and able to explain so many things that really brought the place to life for us. We paid $40 for the six of us and I have to say that we thought this was the best $40 we have spent on our whole time travelling. We had lunch on our return at $3 per person, which was plentiful and delicious. We borrowed bicycles in the afternoon and explored to local area. Hung is a genuinely nice guy, and was so helpful with arranging onward travel to Saigon, and even took the time to write me a note with instructions!
I would definitely recommend this place if you want some friendly Vietnamese hospitality, and don't mind being a little out of the way. We stayed two nights, but one would probably be sufficient. Delicious rice wine!",Date of stay: August 2012,Hung‘s Homestay,4,"Cai Rang, Vietnam"
Harrowing but essential,"Our family (four teenage sons) visited this site, and found it an incredibly moving experience. We took other readers advice and visited S21 first. This was definitely the right way to go about it as it provided a background picture before we learned more of the atrocities of the Killing Fields. We paid the $5 entrance fee, and found the audio guide which was included informative, and the narration excellent, deeply moving, and absolutely essential. You should not miss this experience if you are visiting this area, it can offer you some insight into the horrendous suffering the Cambodian people have endured in our lifetime.
We were left in complete bewilderment how human beings can inflict this amount of pain and suffering on other human beings, indeed their fellow countrymen. A harrowing experience, but such an important one. Do not miss it.",,Choeung Ek Genocidal Center,4,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia"
Incredibly moving.,"Words are insufficient to describe the pain and suffering these people endured. The prison showed gruesome exhibits of former prisoners, Kymer staff, and the conditions in which they lived, not to mention the horrific instruments of torture. We paid for a guide who was informative and definitely worth the fee. I feel we would have missed a lot had we not taken up his services. It was also moving to meet two of the seven survivors of S21. We visited before going on to the Killing fields. This place is distressing but definitely should be visited to educate the rest of the world about the atrocities which happened such a short time ago. Don't miss it.",,Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum,4,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia"
Worth a visit but take a guide,We visited the Royal Palace and paid an extra $10 for a guide which was money well spent. Gorgeous grounds and elaborate palace . Learned.a huge amount from our guide and feel this really enhanced our visit. Silver pagoda was worth seeing. Dress appropriately and enjoy.,,Royal Palace,4,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia"
Budget accommodation very close to the night market.,"We spent three nights in this guest house and were very pleased with the convenient yet quiet location. We paid over the odds for rooms but I had booked these in advance as we are a family of six and I wanted to be sure of accommodation. Other people who took over our room paid $13 a night so be prepared to bargain. The free wifi was well used, as was the seating area upstairs, great shelter from rain showers which were plentiful. We hires motorbikes from the guest house and these were reasonably priced and of a good standard. The staff were really helpful and kind, and I would happily recommend this guesthouse if you are staying in Luang Prabang.",Date of stay: August 2012,Rattana Guest House,4,"Luang Prabang, Laos"
Comfortable accommodation. Well located near riverside. Friendly staff.,"We only stayed one night at Auberge Sala Inpeng but were very pleased with our choice. Staff were helpful and rooms were clean and comfortable. Good convenient location, and scooter hire just around the corner. From here we took the minibus service to cross the border and catch a train to Bangkok. This involved pick up directly from the accommodation and transfer to the train station. Convenient and minimal hassle.",Date of stay: August 2012,Sala Inpeng Bungalow(Mekong Riverside Inn),4,"Vientiane, Laos"
"Lovely budget accommodation, near centre of town, but in a quiet location. Extremely helpful and charming staff.","We stayed at the Motherhome Guesthouse during a recent stay in Siem Reap. We found the staff to be exceptionally helpful and courteous. Nothing was too much trouble. The room was comfortable and the tuk tuk drivers outside the hotel were an easy and convenient method of transport into the heart of town. Free cycle hire was handy, and also the use of the pool at the sister hotel, Motherland Inn was very much appreciated. Breakfast was very good, and when we made an early start this was supplied in advance to take away. Really really recommend this guest house. An absolute gem!",Date of stay: August 2012,MotherHome Guesthouse,4,"Siem Reap, Cambodia"
Really pleasant way to see countryside around Siem Reap.,"I went on a 2 hour ride with Sokong who was a delightful guide. We left at 7 am which was a good time to go as later would have been uncomfortably warm. I rode a horse called Cali, short for California who was quiet and well behaved, and although she did spook a couple of times, she was a really pleasant ride. Sokong was my guide, and he speaks good English and is warm and chatty and I learned so much through him about life in Cambodia. We rode through villages and rice paddies and to a local fish farm. We walked mainly ( my choice) as I was happy to see life in the slow lane and to chat, but if I had wanted a faster ride, this would have also been okay too. The lovely thing to see is that the horses are well cared for and looked after. I took advantage of the tuk tuk service which came and picked me up, and therefore had no worries about finding Happy Ranch, as it is quite out of the way. A good experience.",,The Happy Ranch Horse Farm,4,"Siem Reap, Cambodia"
"Great hotel, handy for overnight stay prior to border crossing into Laos","We stayed in this chalet style hotel overnight prior to crossing into Laos the following day. Rooms spotlessly clean, well equipped, and lovely views across the Mekong to Huai Xai. Chiangkhong is a nice little town, we were able to do laundry and rent scooters and have an excellent massage, and all in one afternoon! Plenty of eating places to choose from. Good breakfast at Chiangkhong Teak Garden. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",Date of stay: August 2012,Chiangkhong Teak Garden Riverfront Hotel,4,"Chiang Khong, Thailand"
Convenient location and delightful staff and best breakfast in Myanmar,"We stayed in three rooms as a family of six. Warm reception and welcome drinks were a lovely touch each time we returned to the Inn. Staff very helpful, and kind. Rooms basic, but clean, and perfectly adequate. Good Internet connection in cafe virtually next door. Convenient for cycle hire and we did the boat tour of Inle Lake as organised by Mingalar Inn, and had a great day.
Breakfast was generous, and our four teenage sons devoured the pancakes which were plentiful. We were very happy with our choice of place to stay.",Date of stay: July 2012,Mingalar Inn,4,"Nyaungshwe, Myanmar"
