10yr old 1st fishing boat trip,"Lovely traditional fishing boat, with plenty of room for 10 -12 persons.. The crew were great, serving drinks (unlimited), telling you about the local area and helping everyone fish with rods over the side of the boat..They helped our boy bait the line and spent time teaching him techniques and how to tell when the fish were biting and when to pull your road up and start reeling in. The bait was shrimp and the fish loved it... We caught lots put back into the sea a few as they were too small to eat.

Captain cooked lunch on the bbq at end of boat, Fresh fish including any fish we caught.. If you dont like fish, you could choose from chicken or pork all served with a greek salad.

Great day, great fun, and price good...",Date of experience: July 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Amazing..The Best,"Amazing! Thank you for looking after us during our 3 night stay. Special thanks to Banana & Bank..

This resort is the best... The food is so fresh, the staff go out of their way to spoil you and the massages our out of this world..

Snuggled on the beach with a little village behind you can't do anything but relax.. The village has everything you need and prices very reasonable.

We went for an ocean front room and woke up early to see the sun rise.. Rooms are immaculate and walk in overhead showers that fit 2 persons comfortably..

Don't look no further just book and enjoy

Thank you Buri Rasa..",Date of stay: November 2017,Buri Rasa Village Phangan,1,"Ko Pha Ngan, Thailand"
not what you think,"The menu was badly translated for English. . an insult to Google.

The food once worked out was small luke warm and over priced. 2 x king prawn 18 euro.. no side dish.. just 2 lonely prawns on a plate..

I took a pic from the menu for deserts..",Date of visit: January 2017,Nou Manolin,1,"Alicante, Spain"
"Good Room, Good Food, Great Value","Stayed for 1 night while house hunting in the area. Lovely pub with good selection of beers and largers. The specials board was full of hearty food and vegetarian selection. If that isn't enough you have a full menu. Sharon went for rump steak cooked to perfection and I had haddock - beautiful. Make room for the homemade desserts.. Few pints later ready to crash, we was presented with a lovely modern spacious chalet with huge walkin shower for 2! Bed was very comfortable and facilities perfect.. All in all if your looking to stay in or around area you'll be a foul not to try it out. Â£80 p.n. very reasonable.",Date of stay: June 2015,The Corners Inn,1,"Leominster, United Kingdom"
