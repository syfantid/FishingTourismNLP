When I asked why the fridge isn’t working I got the answer this is not a fridge but a box that keeps the temperature
Never heard this before
Staff could be friendlier.

Rooms are small for 4 and we asked in the booking for a room facing the beachfront but received a room facing a empty lot the hotel on the south and very limited beach.

So if you want beach drone don’t book numbers between 11 and 29 these are not beachfront.

If you try to change a towel in the morning between 10:30 to 11:30 no towels are available.

If you try to find a sub bed on beachfront
After 09:30 forget about it. There also no one to help.

If you try to book an attraction outside the hotel like a boat trip or other attractions the front desk will not do it but you have to go out in the heat to a 5 minute away travel agency.

Big disappointment,"We ate at the restaurant before and we had good food in the past
This time was very disappointing!!!
We were 2 couples and came through a Baligam coupon
The offerings of the coupon menu was very good
But the evening started already by not receiving a balcony seating although we had pre ordered so we had to wait and insist for about 15 minutes.
The offered cocktail was good
Then the first course was pretty slow and we got only one portion of suchi instead of 2 which were offered in the menu
We had to tell the waitress 3 times until we received it with the main course
The main course was a real disaster it took about 45 minutes after we finished the first course and the waitress offered an apology because of problems in the kitchen
The four main course shrimp pad Thai sweet and sour chicken fillet with aubergines and abnothet meat course were salty and stale
We left them almost untouched
The waitress offered little simpacy
The desserts were also something unclear with pana Cota as a compensation also stale
I have to admit they had an excellent reputation which turned sour for me..",Date of visit: September 2017,Mr. And Mrs. Lee,1,"Tel Aviv, Israel"

Worst service ever,"I have been coming to eat at Joya since it was opened
Today I had the worst experience
We came a party of 5 a
At 19:30
It took at least 15 minutes until the waitress came to take an order
Than the food took forever
One of the orders unfortunately my mother took a hour and got the table after we al finished and it was a finish salty and not edible
We had to ask for drinks three times as well as for parmigian
Although the waitress knew we were mad as were al the tables around us she never offered any gesture
We took some pasta which was left and even this was given to us open in a cardboard and not in a plastic container
