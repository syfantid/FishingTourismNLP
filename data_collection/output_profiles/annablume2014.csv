Traumtag auf dem Meer❤️,"Es war einfach nur ein absolut perfekter Tag mit den Jungs von Dreamy Cruises auf dem Meer zu verbringen-3 Stops im glasklarem Wasser, Zeit zum Schwimmen und Schnorcheln - die White Rocks bewundern( s. Foto) oder am roten Strand ein Clay-Bad nehmen.... dazu ein köstliches hausgemachtes Mittagessen.... einfach nur total schön:) wir haben es sooo genossen auf dem Wasser , auf dem Boot zu entspannen in herrlicher Natur!!! Danke an das tolle Team für diesen unvergesslichen Ausflug!!!",Date of experience: September 2019,Dreamy Cruises,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Wonderful traditional Greek food!!!!,"We loved this place sooooooo much, we went there almost every day during our holidays to eat there or take away:) all the food was sooo delicious and you can taste the love it was made with.... like your grandma cooked for you!!!! Also Eleni, was always so lovely and chatted with us, made every visit welcoming - so we always wanted to just go back to their restaurant and rarely tried something else:) also mostly locals eat there... so if you really want to try the original Kefalonian cuisine .... go there and taste the most delicious meals!!!! Thank you Eleni and the fantastic woman in the kitchen , who cook all the meals ...,. You gave us such a wonderful time :) you are the best!!!",Date of visit: September 2019,Palia Plaka restaurant - paliaplaka,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Beautiful sail away :),"Antonia and her husband are the most wonderful, heart warming and lovely people you can spend a day on the boat with. We were shown how the fisherman is working daily - collecting the nets , checking the fish and later on throwing it back again in the sea to collect it the next day again!!!! And the best of all , you get to eat the most freshest and delicious fish of your life( for me especially , as I life in a big city far away from the sea). Antonia is a fantastic cook , so she made sure we were all happy the whole day provided with lots of deliciousness!!! And the whole group was so nice to spend with, getting to know so many different life stories, having a break from your rational brain, relaxing your mind and feeding the soul!!! Thank you Antonia and Michaelis.... you Are the best!!!!",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
