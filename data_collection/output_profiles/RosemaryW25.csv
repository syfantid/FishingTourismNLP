Outstanding Day Out!,"I found this outstanding value for my group of three. So Helpful when we had an issue with hire car they arranged to collect us and bring us home afterwards. The Luncheon provided was incredible the most extravagant lobster and Seafood Fest you could wish for including two sorts of Lobster ,Red Mullet!!! and many amazing starters ,side salads. Do not know how they do it at the price! I would highly recommend it . appreciated the amazing old carvel hull Fishing Vessel hand built by owner family over period of two years",Date of experience: July 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Fantastic! Food Wine and Staff,"On Friday 26th Feb 2016I was lucky enough to revisit this place after a few years Iolo is now front of house and a delight!! The food is really exquisite It was BUSY! so book! Excellent Wine list chef came to our table the owners show a ""hands on interest"" in their Customers and local residents have taken the couple who run it to their hearts! I had Escallop starter then Venison with a wonderful Juniper berry ""Jus"" I shared two deserts with others one was a sticky toffee [pudding to die for) and some cheesecake. Forgot to note the name of the Wine we had The whole meal was SUPERB fine dining at its best in a lovely setting",Date of visit: February 2016,Y Sgwar,4,"Tremadog, United Kingdom"
Well worth the drive from South Wales!,"I dined here July 19th ( party of 7)and truly sorry this review is so tardy.
The food was Superb ( I chose the Chef’s Specials, King Scallops and the Liver. The Chef appeared at the table and, after hearing my favourite desert was Crepes Suzettes (not on the menu) promptly insisted on spoiling me What a Trooper! The Restaurant was pretty busy so this was more than the “extra mile.”
Most impressive was the happy crew working there! Including Emma and Wine waiter or maybe Sommelier? Iolo (quite a character and knowledgeable). Smiles and excellent service accompanied us throughout.
Alos good to see, the owners with good business sense and foresight have now put on an early bird Menu to help those with decreasing budgets for eating out. They also plan a small upgrade of the décor.
Will definitely return .
