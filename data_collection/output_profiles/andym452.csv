Fantastic trip,"This isan experience of a lifetime. We left zante Harbour while the sun was rising and then we stopped to put the fishing nets in the water then we had sone melon and drinks. Then we left the netd behind to go and have a swim at a beautiful secluded beach for a few hours. Then back to the nets to pull them back on board. A very successful catch too with a variety of fish caught including an octopus and a sponge. Then we sailed to another beach for a swim while the fish was prepared on board with wine spaghetti and bread. Absolutely beautiful meal. Giorgos the captain has a great sense of humour and lets you get involved in everything and if you're lucky he might let you stear the boat. Very clean and hygienic which i didn't expect. Couldn't recommend anymore, dont miss out!",Date of experience: August 2018,Zante Fishing Tours,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
