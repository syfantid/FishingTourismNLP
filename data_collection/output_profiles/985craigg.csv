Dreadful!!!!!!,"Went there for a late lunch/early dinner on 21/6, wish we hadn’t. We asked what was the special of the day and we were informed it was the “lamb in lemon sauce”. So we ordered the special and meatballs in a spicy tomato sauce. It wasn’t busy and there wasn’t any music playing so when you hear the microwave ping it’s a bad sign. My partner even saw the lady removing the special of the day from the microwave. Meatballs were tasty enough but the spicy tomato sauce was non existent. The lamb was dreadful, a plate full of bones and gristle swimming in an oily soup which didn’t taste anything like Lemmon sauce. Give this place a wide berth. Both dishes came out of the microwave. Shameful!!!!!!!!",Date of visit: June 2019,Asteria,1,"Amorgos, Greece"
Lovely Apartment.,"We stayed here in room no.1 for 4 nights from 11-15 June and were very happy. Probably the biggest and best bed I’ve ever slept on in Greece, it was huge, very comfortable and the Guy Laroche bedding was a nice touch. Kitchen corner was small but worked out ok, large fridge freezer and a really good oven if you want to cook. The bathroom has definitely been refurbished for this season and was lovely. There’s a shared patio area outside which is nice. It’s only 2 minutes walk to the port and Maria the owner is very friendly. I wish we could have stayed longer. Good value and highly recommended.",Date of stay: June 2018,Milos Apartment,1,"Milos, Greece"
"What an amazing day, thank you so much.","For years and years I’ve been visiting the Greek islands and have wanted to go out on a traditional fishing boat. When I saw this trip and read the reviews I knew I wanted to go and it didn’t disappoint. What an amazing day we had. Captain Nikos and his wife Frossa are such a lovely couple and helped by the hardworking Simos they gave us a day that we will never forget. I’ve never eaten so much fresh fish in my life. The fish soup was amazing. Fridge full of beers, wine, ouzo, soft drinks etc. All the food was great and the desert from Frossa was so good I wasn’t embarrassed to lick my plate. We were made to feel like family from the moment we stepped aboard. I can’t speak highly enough about this trip and Captain Nikos, what a great guy. Visited some beautiful locations along the way. I just wish I had time to go again. Hopefully next year. If you come to Milos you have to go on this trip, you won’t be disappointed. Thank you so much Nikos and Frossa.",Date of experience: June 2018,Milos Fishing Experience,1,"Milos, Greece"
We loved La Luna.,"Stayed at the La Luna for 3 nights from 2nd - 5th June and had a great time. Fantastic location with lovely hosts Maria and her son Andreas. We stayed in room 15 and the view from the terrace was great, just be careful of your head when you go from the room to the terrace. Quite a small double bed, but not complying and a great bathroom, shower was lovely. Thanks very much to Andreas for numerous lifts to and from the port and the restaurant tips. Was surprised to find a great fully equipped communal kitchen that I didn’t read about on booking.com. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone looking for accommodation in Chora.",Date of stay: June 2018,Pension La Luna,1,"Ios, Greece"
Yummy Yummy!!!!!,"Right next to the square in Chora, open from lunchtime until the early hours of the morning. Great chicken gyros pitta for €2.50, I couldn’t get enough of them. My partner preferred to eat the Tuna Crepe which were absolutely delicious. Adonis and his Sister Evi and all of his team were so nice and friendly. Highly recommended. They also deliver free of charge.",Date of visit: June 2018,Yummy,1,"Ios, Greece"
It wasn’t great.,"We visited for lunch Monday 4/6, ordered the Meatballs and a Tuna Salad. The owner was a bit grumpy and mumbling to himself in Greek which my intuition should have told us not to bother. The meatballs were very dry and bland and it tasted like they were fried in old oil. The Tuna Salad came to the table as a Chefs Salad, but was replaced and to be fair was nice. Nice location in the port but I wouldn’t recommend it.",Date of visit: June 2018,Akrogiali,1,"Ios, Greece"
Great Value.,We stayed here from 26/5 to 02/06 and we were very happy. Less than 5 minutes walk to the port and only 30 seconds from Agios Georgios beach. Thanks to Vaggelis for looking after us and his local recommendations. Stayed in Room 1 which was always nice and clean. Would stay here again and recommend it to others.,Date of stay: June 2018,Alpha Studios,1,"Naxos, Greece"
€4 for nothing!!!!!,"Visited this morning Sunday 3/6. I know it’s an amazing historical site, about 4,500 years old but don’t buy a ticket to go in. It costs €4 but you only get to see a tiny portion of it, about 60 meters from the entrance and that’s it!!!! There are 3 signs giving a brief description and the cashier stood watching us during our entire visit to make sure we stayed within the tiny boundary which was uncomfortable. Very little to see at all. The cashier knew we were going to complain when we left and was already prepared with answers. It appears everyone complains. Shame on the Greek Ministry of Culture for charging €4 per person to see this. My advice would be to walk up the hill of Ios Chora and look down on it. Or if you’re feeling naughty, go on a Monday when it’s closed, sneak over the small wall and view it for free. Felt like I’d been ripped off. Save your money and visit Delos instead, much more interesting.",Date of experience: June 2018,Archaeological Site of Skarkos,1,"Ios, Greece"
Magic Morfoula’s,"Stayed for 3 nights 23-26 May. Great value accommodation in a lovely location only 2 minutes walk to old town. Very friendly family run business. Mrs Morfoula was lovely and very helpful with recommendations. Her son Vaggelis is a star, picked us up from the airport and dropped us off at the new port. Our room (number 4) was great, cleaned daily, great views. I would highly recommend staying here if you visit Mykonos.",Date of stay: May 2018,Morfoula's Studios,1,"Mykonos, Greece"
Still the best Gyros and Souvlaki in Greece.,Without doubt my favourite Gyros in Greece. I just can’t get enough. Super tasty and good value. You have to try one if you’re in Naxos.,Date of visit: May 2018,Yasouvlaki Naxos,1,"Naxos, Greece"
Delightful old bakery.,"You have to try this place if you’re in Mykonos, it’s a real gem. Lovely atmosphere, great cakes and coffee but the highlight for me was the chicken pie, absolutely delicious!!",Date of visit: May 2018,Gioras Wood Medieval Mykonian Bakery,1,"Mykonos, Greece"
Awful Gyros Pita.,"I was walking by and saw it was packed with locals which is usually a good sign so I popped in for a takeaway Chicken Gyros Pita. It was awful. Always a bad sign when they don’t freshly carve the meat and just take the lid off a tin of previously carved. It was dry, literally two slices of chicken, I slice of tomato, a few bits of onion and tzatziki. I know Mykonos is more expensive than other islands but €3.70 for that was disgraceful!!!! Don’t go here for a Gyros!!!!",Date of visit: May 2018,Snack Bar Fanis,1,"Mykonos, Greece"
Avoid the semi basement room!!!!!!!,"Agia Anna is lovely, Flora studios (80m to the beach) as a whole may be ok, but make sure you don't stay in the basement room!!! We asked if we could move to another room but the owner was very strict and wouldn't allow it even though there were empty rooms above us. The room was really large, but not so clean, very dark and felt damp. Fridge stopped working halfway through the holiday. Towels changed 3 times and bed sheets were changed once during our 10 day stay. The bed wasn't even made, just clean sheets left for us to make it ourselves. The owner has virtually no English, but when in Greece what do you expect. Not a problem, her daughter lives close by and helps when needed. One day we had a small plate of biscuits left for us. Wifi and A/C was good. Location is good, but don't stay in the basement!!!! It's made even worse when the family park their 4x4 across the entrance to apartment.",Date of stay: September 2017,Flora Studios & Apartments,1,"Naxos, Greece"
Good view but that's it!!!!,"Having been recommended this restaurant we were truely disappointed. Not only by the awful food but the poor service and deceitful practices of the owners.

Where to start? The view is good but the rest was awful.

We ordered Veal in tomato sauce (€11:50), Sea Bream (€12:00), 1/2 litre House Rose (€4:20) and a small water (€0:70). In total €28:40.

The Veal was offered with potatoes or rice, I ordered the potatoes foolishly assuming they would be the standard Greek style oven Potatoes. I was wrong, it came with French fries, not a massive problem because I'm not fussy. The problem was the huge lump of fatty gristle in the meat. The meat that was edible was tough and chewy but the huge lump of fat left on my plate made me feel sick everytime I looked at it. The tomato sauce wasn't great either. A very poor dish definitely not worth €11:50!!!

The Sea Bream again was offered with potatoes or rice, wanting neither we asked if it was possible for it to be served with vegetables, yes we were told. As you can see from the photo, again it was served with.....French fries. To their credit a side dish of vegetables was served when we pointed it out. The fish however looked quite small for €12:00 and had been grilled far too long and was dry. Another dish badly presented and not worth the money!!!

The House Rose was good.

Wandering off down the beach I was wondering how we had managed to pay over €30 for such a terrible lunch. Retrieving the bill from my pocket I noticed that we had been charged for bread, not just one portion but two and we hadn't had any!!!

Come on, I know €2 is not going to break the bank, but don't be so devious and add it to our bill if we haven't had it.

In summary, dreadful food, poor service and thieving owners. Eat somewhere else!!!!",Date of visit: September 2017,Taverna Paradiso,1,"Naxos, Greece"
Tasty dinner with a nice view to Paros.,"We were welcomed into the restaurant by a very friendly member of staff and seated at a front row table with a lovely view. The food was tasty, we ordered the Meat Balls and Moussaka. The Moussaka was tasty but was a disappointingly small portion. We requested a salad with the meatballs instead of the potatoes and it was served exactly how we had asked and again was tasty. We were given free toasted garlic bread and a complimentary fruit plate. Out of principle, we didn't order wine as we thought €8 for a bottle of Retsina was far too much.",Date of visit: September 2017,Trata,1,"Naxos, Greece"
"Friendly owner, huge portions.","The owner (Dimitris) is more than happy to take you straight to his huge barrel of wine for a welcome glass and show you his food for the day.

The food comes in huge portions and is relatively cheap. We ordered Moussaka and Beef in tomato sauce, both good but could have been seasoned slightly better. The views are great especially at sunset.

In addition to the welcome wine we were given a complimentary fruit plate and a choice of Ouzo or Raki.

Not perfect but you will leave with a full belly and a good feeling.",Date of visit: September 2017,Gorgona Restaurant,1,"Naxos, Greece"
Cheap Lunch.,"We were only in Naoussa on a day trip from Naxos and were very disappointed to find out that many of the restaurants were only open from 18:00 so we had a late lunch here.

Ordered a Greek Salad, Chicken Souvlaki and Sausage, all good and tasty. Washed down with a relatively cheap beer.

Good service, good portions.",Date of visit: September 2017,Pita Frank Grill House,1,"Paros, Greece"
Afternoon coffee and dessert.,"Beautiful Bakery, over 100 years old with a huge selection of fresh cakes, sandwiches and much, much more.
We stopped here while waiting for our ferry back to Naxos. We ordered iced coffee and cakes which were very tasty and very reasonably priced. Huge seating area, very relaxing and friendly with good wifi.

Highly recommended ;-)",Date of visit: September 2017,Ragoussis Bakery Bistro,1,"Paros, Greece"
Delicious Lunch.,"Visited for lunch today on the recommendation of friends who have been coming to Naxos for 16 years. They were spot on, the food was delicious. I've been lucky enough to have visited over 20 Greek Islands and it was possibly the best Moussaka I've ever had. Rabbit Stifado was also very good. Thanks to Michalis for the friendly service,",Date of visit: September 2017,Scirocco,1,"Naxos, Greece"
Great Gyros and Souvlaki by the beach.,Good value tasty food by the beach. Chicken Gyros Pita and Chicken Souvlaki are very good. Very good value and lovely location by the beach.,Date of visit: September 2017,Souvlucky,1,"Naxos, Greece"
Best Gyros ever!!!!,"I've eaten a lot of Gyros in Greece, visited many Islands, the Chicken Gyros and Chicken Souvlaki we ate this evening was lovely. We will be back ;-)",Date of visit: September 2017,Yasouvlaki Naxos,1,"Naxos, Greece"
Tasteless Gyros,"When I'm in Greece I eat my own body weight in Gyros, but this was awful. Small and tasteless, no Tabasco sauce. Anything spicy I asked, was offered pepper. I would not recommend this place! For a real tasty Gyros go to Yasouvlaki in Naxos town or walk down to Plaka beach and try Souvlucky.",Date of visit: September 2017,Lefto’s Souvlaki & Kebab House,1,"Naxos, Greece"
Disappointed.,"After a long walk from Agios Prokopios we were hoping for food and drinks at this nice looking place on the beach. I know it was a Sunday afternoon and was packed with locals, but there were free tables and the staff did see us. We stood there waiting for few minutes and were totally ignored by the staff. Just a hand gesture from one of the staff to sit down would have been fine but we were totally ignored. I love Greece, I love Greek people, but the staff here were not interested in our business.",Date of visit: September 2017,Mikri Vigla Restaurant,1,"Naxos, Greece"
Don't drink the Raki!!!!!!!!,"Try it if you like Moussaka, it was absolutely delicious. Unfortunately the fish was over cooked, complimentary fruit bowl was ageing and avoid the raki at all costs, it's revolting!!!!! The bill had a some hidden extras in there too.",Date of visit: July 2015,Maria's Restaurant,1,"Crete, Greece"
"Great food, great service.","Ate here 19/7. Ordered Moussaka and grilled fresh Sardines, both were excellent. Service was friendly and welcoming. Was given a welcome drink (ouzo),bread,olives,chocolate cake and raki all on the house. Highly recommended.",Date of visit: July 2015,Tavern Strata,1,"Crete, Greece"
"Average food, terrible service.","Food was quite bland. Probably the worst Moussaka I've ever had, full of potato. Had to wait ages for the food. Even had to wait 20 minutes for the bill. Waiters were too busy drinking shots with other customers. Wouldn't recommend it.",Date of visit: July 2015,Cactus Taverna,1,"Crete, Greece"
Lovely meal.,Beautiful freshly grilled Sea Bream and excellent Moussaka. Complimentary desert. Our waitress Judit was very friendly and helpful explaining what was on the daily menu. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Chania.,Date of visit: July 2015,Kalderimi,1,"Crete, Greece"
