Genuine Greek experience in Milos!!!,"Coming from Santorini where it was too cold to swim in this period, we were hesitant to go on another cruise...but it was the best decision ever! Captain Nikos and his wife treated us with much hospitality and kindness during the trip. It was a fun n unique experience eating the fishes from the fishing net. We learnt a lot from the couple and there was wonderful food served onboard. Fresh seafood, beer, dessert, wine and even fruits! Truly down to earth people that make Milos unique ;)",Date of experience: April 2019,Milos Fishing Experience,5,"Milos, Greece"
