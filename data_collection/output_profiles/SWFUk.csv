Sad return visit...,"We came here last year and had a wonderful meal so we thought we would return again. The ambience and atmosphere is very nice indeed. But unfortunately this time the food was not a patch on what it was last time. My daughter had the French onion soup as she so enjoyed it last time we visited. Then this was a luscious bowl of onion soup with a large crouton with bubbling cheese on top. This time it was a bowl of brown gravy like soup with a small pot of croutons on the side and some grated cheese in a pot on the side! How sad was this, she said it tasted nothing like the soup last year. I had the pork and it was dry and tasteless. I complained and they replaced my meal with some muscles and fries but this was not really what I wanted. I was so looking forward to having pork. My grandson did the best he had the sirloin steak which was cooked to perfection. It did not leave a lasting memory for us as it did last time.",Date of visit: August 2020,Le Petit Bistro,4,"Guernsey, United Kingdom"
Lunch today!,"Lunch out today. All of our meals were very good indeed and we really enjoyed
the set menu 15.95 and it was great value too..grandson had spaghetti bolognaise which he said was very tasty indeed. My lasagne was one of the best ever and the chicken my daughter had she really enjoyed.
The service and attention from the staff was utmost, kind friendly and very professional staff. This will definitely be a regular place for us when we relocate to the island!",Date of visit: February 2020,Da Nello,4,"Guernsey, United Kingdom"
Lovely lunch!,Popped in here on the off chance for lunch yesterday. Greeted superbly by the staff who arranged a very nice table overlooking the sea. Grandson had fish and chips daughter had the lobster soup and I had fillet of plaice with mash and veg and a pesto sauce. We all agreed the food was absolutely gorgeous but what made the whole experience worthwhile was the wonderful waiter we had in the restaurant. Afterwards we had a look around and this is definitely a very nice hotel...thank you.,Date of stay: December 2019,The Old Government House Hotel & Spa,4,"Guernsey, United Kingdom"
Great Sunday Lunch!,"My daughter and my grandson and I dined here last Sunday. We didn’t book but we were greeted by a young smiling face who said it was no trouble to find us a table! We ordered the Sunday platter which was enough to feed all three of us, both my daughter and I eat small portions though.The platter of chicken and roast pork was very reasonably priced for £20.00!, however my grandson wanted the lamb shank which was a special and he devoured the whole lot. We really enjoyed the food and vegetables were good quality and tasty. We had a bottle of very nice wine too..we were to full to eat desert but it did look good. After the meal we spoke with Richard the manager about hotel availability and we booked to come and stay in August!!",Date of stay: May 2019,Driftwood Inn,4,"Guernsey, United Kingdom"
Wonderful 18 days!,"Well we had a superb time here, two ladies together.We felt safe and very well cared for. Yes there are a couple of issues that need attending to and I will point them ou later in the review. but first I must concentrate on the positives.
The food overall is good. La Maree being our favourite place Ishwaree and Ramesh run this like a dream, the trainees Sweta and Neeson add compliments to this also, but you can tell when they are missing from service as it can be somewhat chaotic! But I understand this is being addressed. There are a lot of ‘trainees’ but they are learning and people need to give them the time to do this (after all we all started somewhere!!) overall the staff are courteous polite and very helpful.
The buffet restaurant food was a bit of a mixed bag but again the staff were their strength there. We did not really like the barbecue as it was not to our taste. The Banyan Asian food was very good indeed in our minds as we dine a lot out at Asian restaurants, however the service is slow as there are very little staff on duty to serve who run theirselves ragged trying to please. This restaurant lacks atmosphere and is very hot if you do not sit under a fan!!...All if the AI menu choices are very easy to understand but we ate breakfast at La maree most days at a cost of 600 rupees for the two of us which we personally felt was very good value indeed. The room was fine for what we required clean and well appointed albeit a little dated and we had the beds made up as singles at our request. We were on the BA early Morning arrival flight and we were in our room by 10.30 excellent and thank you to the welcoming no receptionists.
The hotel was somewhat quiet when we arrived but filling up as we departed. There are several babies at the hotel which did not bother us at all but we did see some guests looking a little irritated!
The pools are nice but as we were departing so me guests had large inflatables in the pool, which is not big enough for these and there is a sign saying so, sadly this does not seem to be enforced!....The swim up bar was a bit hit and miss service wise and there were several wasps around. Beware as my friend got stung twice when we were by the pool on our first day! No fault of the hotel just wanted to point this out. The waiter service on the beach and pool was good. As in all tropical climates we had the peverbial downpours and the hotel did its utmost via the cleaners to clean up and signpost where possible.
One point I need to mention as into our second week my fried slipped down the little step from the toilets in reception, the staff were very helpful but if the sign warning of the step was a little more prominent perhaps this would not have happened?
We understand that the hotel is soon to undergo refurbishment which I am sure would be a good thing....however please do not let this very nic lirpttoe hotel loose its colonial charm!",Date of stay: February 2019,Maritim Resort & Spa Mauritius,4,Mauritius
Pickering for WWII weekend Railway trip!,"Well what can I say except very good pub food at amazing prices served by very accomodating staff. We travelled from Pickering by train in the pouring rain to Grosmont. Wet and weary we went into the ‘air raid shelter’ namely the Station Tavern!! It was warm and dry in the dining room but getting a table for five not easy when the largest table was taken by two men who were obvious walkers...needless to say they didn’t offer to move! However they left before our food came so we moved tables. Upon sitting both my daughter and myself noticed the seats were very wet!! It was then we realised the ‘walkers’ had put their wet rucksacks on the seats....in my book there is something about consideration for others!! Anyway that said chairs moved we enjoyed our lunches. Beautiful fish, soup, black pudding steak and scampi! All washed down with wine and bear made the journey back in first class very successful! Thank you Station Tavern",Date of visit: October 2018,Station Tavern,4,"Grosmont, United Kingdom"
Not far off A1!,"Stopped here as near A1 and travelling to Pickering for the weekend...6 of us in all and not booked, it was a Thursday lunch time and very busy but the managed to fit us in by moving around the tables. The staff were very friendly and accommodating...the food delicious. Gammon one of the tastiest I’ve ever had, fish huge and fresh. Soup obviously home made served in large bun, nice touch. Grandson had bone which is his favourite cooked medium rare to perfection. The whole meal so good we booked for Sunday lunch to have on our way back...see you soon",Date of visit: October 2018,The Chequers Inn,4,"Retford, United Kingdom"
"Well this was different.,,","We travelled on this trip at 5pm....yesterday.....I think if you are looking for a fishing trip then you need to do the morning trip!! Saying that ...it was great the kids could see the putting out of 6km of nets!! Ready for the mornings trip catch....It seemed a long labourious task that Captain Mihalis and Hassan did with ease. It made us laugh as there were lots of seaweed relics in the nets. The whole trip was made a lot more bearable by three very lovely ladies that joined us on this trip, and they thankfully supervised the children when they went for a swim from the boat...unfortunately my husband and I due to arthritis could not manage to get out of the boat to swim, neither can my daughter who has injuries to her foot. The children both age 9 swam beautifully from the boat and back to the boat. Finally Antonia cooked the most beautiful meal ever.... the lobster was massive and plentiful salads were gorgeous and I don’t know the name of the bread with tomatoes cucumbers and everything else traditional Greek dish was fabulous. Antonia even provided the children with spaghetti some plain as we have a very fussy eater! All washed down by what Antonia called Grape juice ! It was lovely we all enjoyed ourselves..... thank you all very very much ...we got back to the port around 10 o’clock and the kids were exhausted and fell asleep,n the way back in the car",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Great Greek food, on a great beach",We visited here last week with our son in law daughter and two grandchildren. It was a lovely restaurant the food was excellent the kids were tired after they had spent three hours in the sea! and then we ate! They then went down to the beach after dark..to see the hatched turtles go back into the seab and they loved every single minute of it. The food was good wholesome and totally Greek ...thank you we will be back!,Date of visit: August 2018,Avithos Preview Taverna,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Second visit not so good!,"The first time we visited here we enjoyed it emmensley, caring staff good quality food. This time we did not enjoy the food as much, although the staff were very attentive. The views are beautiful and watching the sunset very gracefully in the background whilst eating very nice indeed,

Agree only if you want a view!,"We tried this restaurant the first night we were here. We were plagued by wasps throughout the entire meal as we came to eat around 6 PM. We were seated at a table by very grumpy staff! Food ordered was not good took over half an hour to come, then when it did it was not of the best quality we have had an Cephalonia. We were told by the people on the next table that coffee grounds burnt kept the wasps away, they asked for them and even though the staff could see we were suffering from the wasps ....and having the two children with us, the staff never offered the coffee grounds to us!!! The people on the next table told us we should be asking for them. I do not feel we should need to ask for these in a restaurant they should be matter of course! Food was not cheap and I would not go here again except for drinks and the view.",Date of visit: August 2018,Waterway,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely cheap and rustic!,"Had a great meal here, did not book but they fitted us in! food was delicious especially the seabass.

Real good pub grub!,"At the recommendation of my son in laws paremts (who reside in Dartmouth) We all went here for lunch yesterday, with family. Booked table as there was eight of us. What good wholesome food this was. Hubby and I had the liver and bacon which was a very generous portion indeed!! One grandson had the Gammon and he said it was very nice indeed, they even accommodated him with a Stilton sauce which he loves. The small grandson had the kids meal of bolognaise pasta and exchanged the garlic bread for chips, which was a sure winner!! The others had ham egg and chips which indeed looked very inviting. Daughter had the mushroom starter which for her was like a meal. Three of us had sweets and the home made crumble and sticky toffee pud was delicious. All served by a delightful waitress who took the time to converse with us all. There is a small but well furnished garden but we chose to dine inside and it was very comfortable. Thank you we will be sure to come again.",Date of visit: July 2018,The Old Inn,4,"Halwell, United Kingdom"
Definitely the Best!!,"This is the second time my husband and I have dined at this restaurant. The food is cooked to perfection it is tasty spicy without being too hot. They will cook it as hot as you like though! To start we has onion barges which were huge and very tasty. For mains we had a lamb tikka biriany, King prawn curry , alo gobi and a delicious garlic naan. after all of that we were extremely full. The food was hot, presented well and the staff are very attentive.",Date of visit: May 2018,Sonargaon Tandoori,4,"Whittlesey, United Kingdom"
"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!","We ate from the UK and I prebooked this trip with Captain Buddy following recommendation and research. The communication received was good so I booked daughter, son-in-law and nine-year-old grandson in with Captain buddy for the afternoon which they did yesterday. This is the first time grandson has done any real fishing and the support from Captain Buddy was much appreciated. They all said how knowledgeable and patient he was and that he explained all to my Grandson who was full of his tales from the trip, and spoke about it all evening! To finalise it all Captain Buddy filleted the fish for them and it’s now in the fridge!! Memories like this are worth their weight in gold. Thank you so much Captain Buddy.",Date of experience: March 2018,Captain Buddy LaPointe,4,"Marathon, Florida"

3 star!!,"It is a shame about this glorious building...we were greeted on arrival at around 5.15 pm by the reception lady who was somewhat distant!! We booked a room specifically as it featured an en suite bathroom with bathtub, over-bath shower, bathrobes and slippers together with Taylor of London toiletries. It also offered extra large double bed, whichas not so thin people we were attracted to!...However on arrival...We were informed that we had three flights of stairs to climb complete with our luggage!! And that she could not do it as she was the only one on duty!! She did however change the room to the next floor, so we carried our luggage. Then upon entry to the room we noticed that we had a standard double bed!! When questioned she said you should have phoned to tell the hotel in advance as we do have extra large beds!! I said that was what I booked in line and was told ‘you booked via booking .com! I repeated what I booked but it seem to fall on deaf ears!! I asked if check out was 12.00 and was told it was now 11am as had changed!! Seeing as we were going to funeral in Hastings we took the 12.00 check out to be good...the lady said it would be difficult to accommodate a late check out as the hotel was full the next day...she would see...but we heard nothing...Anyway the room bathroom smelt awful..drains we think..but we were tired from the journey, we went out and ate then to bed...difficult sleepless night for me as no room in the bed...but we made the best of it..we went early to breakfast then dressed to check out...when the next lady in reception asked how our stay was I’m sure she wished she’d never asked!! Anyway breakfast was excellent...but needless to say we won’t be staying here again...sad to say.",Date of stay: February 2018,Rye Lodge Hotel,4,"Rye, United Kingdom"
Fabulous New Year!,"My husband and I along with our friends have just returned from one the best New a Year breaks we have ever had. from the moment we stepped through the door it was non stop partying, lights, trees, food, drink and great entertainment, the hotel entertainment team were amazing and the nicest people. in fact the whole staff looked after us wonderfully it made New Year exiting again. singing, fireworks even a piper laid on for Midnight in house. The only negative was the room, we booked a royale room in the main house.but it was dusty...however there were diaries and biscuits as surprise gifts etc. I could go on and on, but I need to say the food was good and waiter Jesus and drinks waiter Precious wonderful thank you all.",Date of stay: December 2017,Warner Leisure Hotels Alvaston Hall Hotel,4,"Nantwich, United Kingdom"
Be patient! It’s very lovely food...,Be patient because the whole experience is gonna take about 2-3 hours.. We were sitting in a table for x 4...this is the second time I have had the privalige to visit this place...looks like a coffee/cafe shop from the outside....but one big surprise awaits you! Where we sat we could see the ham being carved!! And as each waiter/res passed view each meal being served from the chef preparing the dishes.The prawns Pil Pil...and the steak and Roquefort Sauce was really lovely....the only reason for the 4 star is that we were a little cramped around the table.partially sitting in the walkway that was not the most conducive!! However we had beers and house vinos which were of good quality...Thank you for the memorable experience..,Date of visit: January 2018,Polar-Cafeteria Jamoneria,4,"Monforte de Lemos, Spain"
Again!!,"Well what can I say...fabulous 5 day stay with Omar's ?una and their beautiful daughter..
We love this place and will visit again next year...breakfast is to die for. Lovely new spa pool this year too. Lebanese food great, Frank and Dean show excellent!

Food for all tastes for all the family!,"Went here last night with all of the family. A little more pricey than we have paid over the last two weeks but definitely worth it for taste and quality and you will not go far wrong if you visit this restaurant. The waiters and staff were very accommodating, one in particular being extremely helpful to us all. We had starters of spareribs, home-made fish soup, prawn cocktail, mushrooms in garlic, and the kids had garlic bread with cheese. All of this proving very nice indeed and it meant we were able to all have individual choice. The special of the night was ribeye steak and it looked wonderful and tasty as said my grandson. I had the cypriot dish of Kleftiko which in true tradition the lamb fell off the bone and you could taste the juices on the potatoes. One of us had fillet steak with a garlic sauce which he said also tasted very nice. Indeed. Another spaghetti carbonara, good to and plenty of it. My other grandson has spaghetti Bolognese and it must've been good because he almost cleared his plate! And he's a connoisseur of that. This was followed by a free round of drinks from the management and we all floated home once again! Thank you very much we will be back.",Date of visit: August 2017,The Agrotikon Restaurant & Bar,4,"Ayia Napa, Cyprus"
Disappointed!,"As an avid follower of Rick Stein, my hubby booked us into this restaurant as we were celebrating our 45th wedding anniversary...for a late lunch, myself ,hubby and teenage Grandson. We have been to Ricks seafood restaurant twice and loved it. (See review) This time however the venue was very disappointing, hard uncomfortable wooden seats and tables crammed into such a small place!! Hubby and I had fish soup to start which was very nice, Grandson saved himself for the 14oz steak, which the chef kindly did a requested Stilton sauce, grandson enjoyed his meal. However we both decided on the Whole grilled plaice with roasted red peppers, chilli, garlic and oregano...fish lacked taste I could not detect the chilli at all neither could hubby, to top it all the fish came with the head on which is something that my husband really dislikes, suppose we should have requested it be removed. In other restaurants we have been asked the question prior.... We also ordered the Cavolo nero with confit garlic, which was only Luke warm. Waitress service was good but I could not help feeling rushed and we did not stay for a sweet or coffee.
If felt that the restaurant was part of the hotel and at this time of year it was very busy. Needless to say we wont be returning.",,St Petroc's Bistro,4,"Padstow, United Kingdom"
Nearly Excellente!,"My husband and I just returned from 16 nights at DLR. this place has customer service tattooed all over ot 'Excellente' by name and nature...thanks to all the numerous staff..to many to mention by name, but Henry and Mabi to name but a few!! The resort is beautiful and lush with flamingos birds in an enclosed space (which is a pity really) It is the perfect size so that it really does not make a big difference which building you are in except if you want some peace in a ground floor room!! because everything is relatively close. However you really need to be in building one or two if you are preferred adults only...We had a pool side walkout room, but it was ground floor and very noisey as all of the rooms lead from the beach or pool to the resturant...the cleaners ate not the quietest also....after all you are on holiday and if you Get up early for work as we do you really don't want to do that on holiday! We tried all of the a-la-carte restaurants which were fantastic (our favourite was the ""french""). The food in the buffet varied every night and always had fresh seafood options and different meat. The Asian is very good too. Now the star of the show...the Olio It is amazing! The view is stunning especially for breakfast...Perfect calm and blue clear water which is a pleasure to swim in. We brought a snorkling set and saw tons of fish right off the beach in chest deep water. The beach is slanted so it is not the easiest to access as there is steps in the adult only beach...or if you like to go for long walks on ...it is small...The beach in front of the resort is private so no one will come and bug you to buy stuff, but there is always the option to walk down the beach past the perimeter and check out the vendors for cheap massages or other souvenirs. There are plenty of beach chairs and we had no issues finding a great spot even in the afternoon. We went to saona Island with pro excersions and they were also great. We only went to one show so cant say much about the entertainment. The casino leaves a lot to be desired and they need to work on the customer service angle for the staff in there as they are often off putting...One thing to keep in mind is this is definitely a family oriented resort. There were LOTS of kids around ( so if this isn't your thing, I wouldn't recommend it) or you go preferred adult only!! You would be hard to find one single person out past 11:30, even at the bars. Also, we met lots of returning guests and english speaking families/ couples in the entire resort. There were lots of french and spanish speaking europeans.
In conclusion, this resort does cost slightly more than some, but it is WORTH IT! You can tell the quality of the food, beach, grounds and just how they run the resort in general. Very organized and enjoyable holiday ! We don't usually visit one place more than once but I don't see why I would bother going anywhere else!",Date of stay: April 2017,"Hilton La Romana, An All-Inclusive Adult Resort",4,Dominican Republic
Excellent family apartment with amazing views and service,"My family of 6 stayed in a 3 bed apartment on the 27th floor over Christmas week.
Santa had presents delivered there before out arrival and the whole Marmara team were excellent Elfs!
I cannot fault the front desk or behind the scene staff at all. They were extremely helpful and knowledgeable the whole time.
Everything you could want is right on your doorstep. Groceries were delivered and the licqor stor and pharmacy were next door!
With the new subway opening in January 2017 the access into central Manhattan will only get better. It was only $15 in a taxi anyway.
The beds in the apartment were very comfortable and the whole apartment was clean.
We asked for another armchair and this was brought straight away. Nothing was too much trouble. We had a clean half way through and the girl was fabulous.
I would definitely recommend the Marmara to anyone and this is the only place I'll stay in Manhattan from now on with my family as the apartment was so spacious.
Thank you so much to all the Marmara team for making this an amazing Christmas.",Date of stay: December 2016,The Marmara Manhattan,4,"New York City, New York"
Disaster Half Term Visit!,"We visited the natural history museum today and it was sheer chaos, my Grandson was absolutely devastated and so disappointed. The crowds of people including all ages and those with screaming babies and toddlers complete with pushchairs, were all let into the museum and our entry during the morning took over an hour. We stayed for precisely 10 minutes as we could not see anything nor could we move for the crowds. There were, in our opinion far to many people let in at the same time consequently causing chaos. The cafe which we passed through on the way out had very upset looking staff trying to cope with the large influx of people all wanting serving at once. Tempers were frayed as it was obvious that people were at their wits end with queuing, not being able to view anything properly at all and others pushing and shoving past them. What a shame as this was to be the hilight of my youngest Grandsons first trip to London, not to mention the price of the hotel nearby. If you take my advice you will not visit during the school holidays.",Date of experience: October 2016,Natural History Museum,4,"London, United Kingdom"
So very lovely .....paradise uncovered!,"This is a beautiful hotel, in a beautiful setting. The views are lovely and the pool area, bars and restaurant area are lovely. The sun loungers were comfortable with thick mattresses...I have experienced far far worse! The pool complete with complimentary towels and parasols made this paradise complete. Not to mention the complimentary cava, rose and water complete with ice on tap available to guests all day.

The room was spacious rustic and tastefully furnished. There is plenty of storage space, a complimentary safe, a tv and a well stocked minibar with a choice of glasses for your beverage. The bed was not comfy at first so the owner kindly arranged a topper to be put on for me!!
I was in room one and I had a shaded balcony complete with canopy to prevent the sun getting it too hot...nice idea really. The balcony faced out with views of the very pretty garden and sea in the background. The bathroom was well equipped with a separate shower cubicle and the shower had two heads, the pressure was very good and powerful. The hairdryer worked very well and the Molton brown toiletries were replenished daily. (Included was moulton brown mouthwash - nice touch) Also in the room was a moulton brown diffuser which gave a calming fragrance to the whole room

The choice of drinks is good and the bar area was beautiful to sit in the evening, with stunning views from the hills over the town. The food I had in the restaurant and at lunch was excellent.

Breakfast was enormous and the best choice I have ever had ...all served up to you on your own table! Such a good choice and a superb peaceful setting. Breakfast also included hot choices which were cooked fresh once you had chosen them (or could fit them in!)

The sucess of this hotel is mainly due to the wonderful attentiveness by the owner Omar and his staff team including Hose and Frank...The service at the restaurant in the evening was very good as was the delightful Lebanese food - the pil pil prawns were one of the best I have had.

Lunch service was also available if you could fit anything in after the humungus breakfast !!

The main reason I came to this hotel was to surprise my dear friend on her 70th birthday. She was staying with friends further down the coast. When I told Omar this he said he could do something nice for her birthday, which he duly did. He arranged cava for their arrival, they put balloons out and made the table look georgeous with wonderful red roses; and my friend was highly delighted! (And completely surprised!)The birthday meal was enjoyed by all four of us and washed down with two bottles of lovely wines. The final delight and suprise was the birthday (pudding) cake, for my friend complete with candle! She then had a tear!! Thank you sooo much Omar and Hose.

So ....a wonderful hotel, beautifully furnished, in a lovely setting and just 20 minutes from Malaga airport.

I will definately return to this lovely peace and paradise.",Date of stay: June 2016,Boutique Hotel Las Islas,4,"Fuengirola, Spain"
Fabulous Hotel!,"We stayed at this hotel following our cruise to Alaska and arrival in Vancouver port. Via a courier we were taken by foot to the hotel which is only 12 to 14 minutes walk away. Our room was not ready on arrival but we were made very welcome in the lobby and offered a drink. Although the hotel is not cheap it is good value, spacious, well-appointed room, excellent central location with easy walking to all areas of downtown Vancouver. Unparalleled service: advice (bang on by the way) and reservations for restaurants, cabs called. We never entered the lobby without being addressed by name and asked if there was anything we needed by front desk staff, concierge, or doorman. Friendly, gracious housekeeping staff. No hesitation in recommending this unique hotel to anyone visiting Vancouver. We stayed at the hotel for three nights and then proceeded I'll journey forward to the Rocky Mountain near train into Calgary. We will not hesitate to return to this hotel again.",Date of stay: October 2015,Fairmont Pacific Rim,4,"Vancouver, Canada"

Wow what a place to stay!,"We stayed here as an overnight stay on our way on the Rocky Mountaineer train to Calgary. When we arrived at the hotel they gave us a room immediately but it had several steps down to the bathroom, this was not ideal as one of us had recently had a knee operation. We returned to reception and they immediately issued us with the drinks voucher while we waited for another room. When the room was ready the receptionist came up into the bar to find us and escorted us to our room which was far far superior to the one they have given us previously. This room had a wonderful view of the mountains. We ate that night in a French bistro type bar having tappers and other wonderful delights including a bottle of very good wine. All in all an excellent stay would not hesitate to stay here again.",Date of stay: October 2015,Fairmont Banff Springs,4,"Banff, Canada"
Very nice stay in pleasant hotel.,"This was the last leg of our rocky mountaineer train trip. We were tired and the journey to Calvary seemed long. We arrived in the evening and were given vouchers to eat in the bar. We ate in the bar the food was wholesome and very well presented and very welcome. The room we had was an apartment type suite,and we had a lounge with a TV and a large double bed Room again with a TV. The bathroom was very small though. We took advantage of going up the Seattle needle as it was right next door and included in our trip. We also took advantage of using the lovely spa that is at this hotel, however we would have liked some lounger seats to be able to sit in there a lot longer. Everyone at this hotel was extremely obliging and very helpful and very interested in our trip. The hotel itself is very grand and the staff extremely obliging. They arranged a taxi to the airport for the next leg of our journey all in all a very good stay we would not hesitate to stay here again",Date of stay: October 2015,Fairmont Palliser,4,"Calgary, Canada"
How sad,"We were looking for a pub to have a meal prior to meeting a friend at Stanstead airport. The reviews were very good on site therefore we decided to give this a try on Friday evening. On entry to the pub the waitress was extremely welcoming however there were very few people in the restaurant it was around 8 o'clock on a Friday night! I ordered the muscles and my daughter ordered the ham egg and chips both arrived fairly promptly my daughters looked fine, however it was obvious to me that the muscles were overcooked. I complained and they were taken away and I was asked if I would like something else I then ordered the special which was lemon sole, with spinach and sauce. It came finally the spinach was obviously very overcooked and a large proportion of it was put on top of the lemon sole, the sauce consisted of olives and what looked like tomato. It was not very tasty at all.
Underneath the sole were new potatoes. I folded back the wings of the sole and attempted to eat the body which was the fillet it however had bones in. As the whole lot was not very tasty I decided to give this a miss.
I was happy to pay for it as They had given me both options however none suited my palate. The waitress came over and took the sole away and apologised, she then reappeared with a raw lemon sole on a plate and proceeded to tell me about the wings and the bones in the wings, which I was totally aware of it and to say how upset the chef was. I am a seasoned cook and I have eaten all over the world. This is the worst meal I have had containing a lemon sole in my life.
Perhaps I should've stuck with a pie and chips as they seem to have been a better option. We will not be visiting here again.",Date of visit: November 2015,The Ash Pub,4,"Stansted Mountfitchet, United Kingdom"
Amazing food and service,"We stayed at the port palace hotel, so decided to celebrate my birthday at this restaurant as its on the rooftop overlooking the amazing boats. The food and service was impeccable. My husband had the lobster, which was the best he'd had and I had the rib, which was just as good. We finished off the evening by being sang to by the restaurants live performer which was lovely.",Date of visit: September 2015,La Marée,4,"Monte-Carlo, Monaco"
Last minute meal out !,"Tried to get into our usual pub as it's got a play area for Grandson, but was fully booked so we reviewed Tripadvisor and chose here. Excellent choice we had a drink on arrival in the garden and the sun was shining the play area is very suitable for children and there weren't many there at that time of the day. Visited with my daughter and two grandsons and girlfriend. We were shown to a table at the back of the restaurant which overlooked the fields and the glass doors were open it was a peaceful field view. I had the salmon which was utterly delicious. My daughter had a home-made beefburger and for once cleared her plate. The younger members of the group had chicken nuggets and home-cooked chips and also cleared their plates. My eldest grandson had the steak with stilton sauce he said was to die for!!! This was further finished by the delicious ice cream and the Baileys cheesecake. All washed down with plenty of drinks and wine from the very attentive staff. The Young waiting girls were delightful and very friendly and made us all feel very comfortable indeed. We ate early but we could see as we were leaving that the restaurant was beginning to fill up on the Friday night
Will definitely go again. Really enjoyed it, thank you.",Date of visit: August 2015,The White Swan Conington Freehouse,4,"Conington, United Kingdom"
Family reunion meal.,It was a very special anniversary which was a marked calendar event for my husband's family. We took all twelve of us to farmers on a Saturday afternoon. We sat in the conservatory with the doors open and the children played outside beautifully. The food was very good. Attentive service from the staff and their friendliness was outstanding. Arthur the manager was extremely courteous and helpful to us all. The food is reasonably priced as are the drinks and a good afternoon was had by us all. Thank you Farmers.,Date of visit: May 2015,The Farmers,4,"Yaxley, United Kingdom"
Lovely Sunday lunch!,"Found this on trip advisor at the last minute as the restaurant we wanted to visit was closed for its annual holiday!! This Restaurant was tucked away outside of St Neots The food was delicious with an excellent choice of carvery dishes and wines to choose from. The service is also exceptional from the chef Brett who was serving the car very and the waitress, but apart from these two, what makes this restaurant different from others is the unique feel and atmosphere inside. On entering you immediately feel welcome, The pub and resturant is a lovely intimate room with delightful service. The staff have an uncanny ability to time the degree and speed of service to suit each table. Very friendly, with excellent knowledge of the food. This is the first pub I have seen that clean the tables and the chairs..well done.
Of course the quality of the cuisine is superb. Very well balanced, nice wine list too we will visit again thank you.",Date of visit: January 2015,The Horseshoe Restaurant,4,"St. Neots, United Kingdom"

Second stay and very very good one!,"This was our second stay at this hotel. This time I went with my daughter her two boys and her eldest boys friend. We had adjoining twin rooms. This hotel does exactly what it says on the tin, it is for families, is very busy and very cosmopolitan, and has very good food. If you cannot find something in the food range that suits you then it is poor show. However we did try one of the speciality restaurants, and the steak was not as we would have expected. The nightly shows were excellent, and the water slides for the children were very good indeed. The rooms are beautiful and clean, and kept up to standard every day by the wonderful Maids.
The staff at the hotel cannot do enough for you, and are available if you need anything.
As my youngest grandson only drinks milk, we were supplied with milk cartons every day by the bar staff.
We have not been to this hotel for some seven years, but the standard remains the same.
I am sure someday we will return, many thanks to all the staff.",Date of stay: July 2014,Crystal Family Resort & Spa,4,"Bogazkent, Turkey"
Work in Progress!,"My husband and I have just had a 3 night B&B stay at the Sea View House.

Can I please remind you all that the current owners have only been in this property for some 8 months and are determined to ' make a difference ' with the work in progress that they are doing to improve the property, this is evident but I am sure they will eventually succeed.
The rooms are very clean and the beds very comfortable and both hosts are eager to please you all. All you need to do is ask if there is something you need.
As for the aroma of 'dogs' (from the last review) although personally we can say we were not aware of this smell at all ??

Upon arrival we were allocated to a twin room as requested!
It also had a sea view which was a bonus.
The reason for this break was to celebrate our friends 65th birthday.

Please understand we are not usually B&B people at all. (In fact I personally dreaded it!)

We are 4 or 5 star hotel or many times premier cruise people; used to being waited on!!

We stayed at Sea Veiw House as our friend had booked the Minack Theatre to celebrate his birthday ( excellent show as usual) and this property is within walk distance to the Minack, another bonus!!

The Owners of this BB are very homely people, clean and provided us with a coffee and glass of wine on arrival a nice unexpected treat.

The breakfast was very good, and included plenty of local Cornish Produce, either with a continental slant or the good old English fry up.

For an evening meal or lunch option you should definitelyk book in at the Logan Rock Pub, very good food but evening booking advised.

The Sea View House was a perfect break for us, this was largely down to the service provided by Pauline and Pippa, a really friendly couple who were happy to assist in making our stay as comfortable and relaxing as possible.
We would like to say a BIG thank you to you both.",Date of stay: August 2014,Sea View House,4,"Penzance, United Kingdom"
Oh Dear!,"We have not been here for some while. In fact it must be a couple of years. When we used to come before we could not get in the door of the pub. This time we en entered with ease.When I booked the restaurant I was easily able to get a table. I think that should have said it all!! The service staff were excellent and very friendly and accommodating however the food lacked lustre, the menu was very limited. Said this then we both chose the rib eye steak, bearing in mind that this is usually with a bit of gristle. Put it this way it was not the best rib steak ever and the hand cut chips were less to be desired. How sad I felt this was and how disappointed I felt with the whole meal We were very unsatisfied with the whole meal but said nothing as we both work away and you get tired of complaining!!!
I think it should have said it all when I realised we were the only customers in the restaurant that evening and it was a Friday night! I

Pre Cruise Stay excellent does what it says on the tin!,"In April this year we stayed overnight while waiting to board our cruise ship the next day. This is the second time staying here, we are a family of 6 and the 3 bedrooms suited us all well (must say we did not use any of the hotels pool ect) The rooms are super large clean and comfortable. The beds have wonderfully comfortable pillows and are large. (King queen doubles),. Coffee machine in the room are good too. We did use room service which we felt was reasonable. Hope to and will definitely stay again.",Date of stay: April 2014,Provident Doral at The Blue Miami,4,"Doral, Florida"
Excellent Birthday Choice Does What it Says on the Tin!,"We stayed here November 13 as the last stop on our 4 week trip to St Lucia for my 60th birthday! We read reviews and our experience is it is true. We loved Sandals Grande and will definitely go back. We loved everything about it....from the beautiful beach, pool (and friendly bar staff) reception staff, the local authentic entertainment, the included activities exercises and water, and the top rate food! Although a wider choice of eating venues would have been appreciated. We did venture into the town for an Indian one night which was one of the best we have eaten. I suppose you could dine at the other Sandals but we drove up from Marigot Bay where we had an apartment, prior to that we stayed at Sandals La Toc and we were aware of the distance which does put some time on your 'night out!
We were very visually impressed and can't say enough about this elegant place though!!
It is a perfect size, everything is so convenient. The rooms here are Grande, are beautiful and clean... simple elegance. We had an upper level room with a garden view, just wonderful--had some minor road noise when you were in the bathroom but this never bothered us.
All staff were courteous and we had the pleasure of a few special interactions with: Piano man, wonderful massage therapist--Thank you for all your special attention!
Also the sunset seen was amazing. We enjoyed the boat trip to the pitons springs and the mud bath was so much fun.as was the boat cruise as well.
We met some very interesting and like minded people. All in all a very lovely end to our holiday of a lifetime! Thank you Sandals Grande St Lucia we will be back.",Date of stay: November 2013,Sandals Grande St. Lucian,4,St. Lucia
Watch what Room You Book and Research it well!,"We spent one week in October 13 (just got around to writing this as we didn't come home till November and needed to get Christmas past!)
This was our first trip to St Lucia and we chose to start our 4 week holiday and to spend my 60th Birthday at La Toc and our final week at the Sandals Grande.
First impressions as we arrived at the airport after a suburb British Airways Club flight, were good we were taken by a back door after customs into a cool lounge with cold water waiting;we were soon herded into a air con mini bus. We did not think the ride was too daunting but we are seasoned travellers.
When we arrived reception took a while and check in took ages, however, things soon got worse, we booked a Pitons Ocean View Room (as it was a special occasion for us both) with Sundeck. What you are not told (or we weren't,) is that this room is some distance from the main part of the hotel, the landscape here is very hilly so we were transported (complete with our 4 cases and associated hand luggage) via a buggy up the hill! Then after climbing some 48 steps we reached our room. We are not the fittest people and after travelling for some 16 hours felt that this room just would not suffice. (Put it this was if we forgot our book when we went to the beach we would not be climbing these steps again!)
Even the porter could not understand why they had put us this far up the hill.
Anyway we returned to reception where we were told we were put into the upgrade room the type we had booked (more fall us really!) We then asked to be moved to a room less physically challenging and was told there was no other room available. By this time I was beginning to get upset and tired after all this was the start of my special birthday trip. Finally we were offered a down graded room which was all they had available and we were informed that if we took this there would be no refund! Well if this room they then offered us was a downgrade; then I would say book one of these rooms all the time, it was on the ground floor, had a terrace out on to the pool a good sea view and it was spacious and clean (even though a little dated)

Following the rocky start we both had a very relaxing and comfortable holiday, met some nice fellow guests and were much entertained by some cracking St Lucian staff. Especially in the piano bar singing along with the wonderful barman in there who knows what you are drinking before you so when you walk in the door!
The beach is nice but we tended to use the pool- there are a number of vendors along it but we stayed in the shady part of the beach and were not troubled in the slightest by them. There is a sizeable and visible securiy presence on the beach - when we went on a stroll down the beach, we were asked our room number as we left the hotel area and our return was noted with a wave and a a grin. It felt secure. The food here is excellent and their is a variety of places to dine. However you do need to book your restaurants when you arrive in order to get a table but overall in fairness, the overwhelming majority of dishes we ate were excellent.

The all-inclusive element was fine by us and I enjoyed being waited on.

Overall, yes we enjoyed our holiday very much and wil be happily coming back to the Sandals brand.
I have fond memories of my birthday evening at Kimonos where hubby and I spent the evening with 4 honeymoon couples, the finale was the party in the piano bar after!
Having read some of the negative reviews on here, I can only conclude that some folk must work really hard to have a bad time.",Date of stay: October 2013,Sandals Regency La Toc,4,St. Lucia
Another excellent stay at Court Lodge fabulous.,"This is the second time we have visited Hillfield Village and w were lucky enough to be able to book Court Lodge again. I wanted to submit a revue this time as this place has proven to us that the standards are consistent.

It is not the easiest place to find but that is part of its charm in the heart of Devon and the directions given by the owners Caroline and Michael, are very precise. I am sure that, if we were lost and called them they would be outside directing us!

It was so nice to walk back into this property again, everywhere was spotless and the owners told us to let them know if we needed anything.
This property, and the owners are fantastic. The property is so well equipped but, even if I could think of something I needed that was not there I know the owners would supply it.

I can't stress enough the care and attention to detail that has been lavished on this property.

There are five bedrooms, four have ensuites, plus a spa full bathroom on the ground floor. Televisions all over the place, including Smart TVs up and down! Internet throughout the building.

Being December it was a little chilly outside and despite the wind and it was great to relax in the outdoor hot tub and then come back in to the cosy lounge.

The kitchen was as well equipped as ours at home with utensils for every purpose (including some mystery ones). We cooked some great meals for us all with local produce.

The only thing we found different on this trip is that we found the beds rather hard, it appears they had been changed since our last visit, however this was dealt with by the provision of extra quilts to soften the blow! (However toppers would be better! )

At first one would think that describing this property as Five Star seems a little pretentious but, in this instance it is fully deserved. Keep up the great work and, hopefully we will be back.",Date of stay: December 2013,Hillfield Village,4,"Dartmouth, United Kingdom"

"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.","Lets start off by saying my husband and I didn't want to leave this place!!!
From the moment I inquired about this property, the service and prompt responses I received was excellent!! The apartment is beautiful !!! The pictures are accurate but the apartment is even more amazing in person!!! The views over Marigot Bay are spectacular, especially at night. There was a nice separate bedroom with super king bed (which for us was like home from home!) The kitchen is well equipt with everything you need from appliances to pots and pans (there's even a garlic press!!) .This apartment is located about 20 minutes drive down from Castries. There are some good restaurants within walking distance. There is a place for Spa services and massages either at the hotel or in a wooden building next door to the marina. Everything you need is right at your door. There is a supermarket below the apartment and a wonderful cafe that serves delicious breakfasts and meals till around 5.30. We hired a car and toured this very pretty island as Marigot Bay is very central for doing this ( driving on the same side as the UK helped tremendously) and if you can drive in London you can definately drive in St Lucia! Less than 15mins drive away there is a petrol station, and a bigger supermarket where you can buy virtually everything you need.
You can tell the owner of this apartment thought about providing the best comfort and service to their guests, and I promise you will not go wrong staying at this apartment.",Date of stay: October 2013,Stunning Waterfront Apartment,4,St. Lucia
Never again!,"We have just returned from a weeks stay in Woolacombe and We all said what a
beautiful part of the world this is.
However friends of ours arranged to stay with their camper van at Golden Coast
Woolacombe Bay with their Grandchildren so as a late deal we decided to join
them with ours.

The best I can say is that all of the children bonded well and had a very good
time.
However we expected Hi de hi and this is exactly what we got.

I am writing this review as we are seasoned travellers and we use reviews to
hopefully get a candid unbiased picture.

The site was full for the week we were there and we could not help but notice
the cramped camping pitches as you came into the site from the main road, there
were pitches right in the middle of the shop cafe and reception!! There were
cars, delivery lorries, busses turning and the incoming and out going traffic
was everywhere. We realised that this was a changeover day but it was very
hazardous driving as there were families and children walking about everywhere,
there was no staff evident and controlling or directing the traffic either.
This did nothing for a first impression. When we were finally able to park check
in was a very simple procedure; our pre purchased vouchers were all ready for us
in an envelope with our name and lodge number on; full marks deserved here.

We booked the highest available accommodation which was a Gold Lodge. I was
informed when booking that these lodges had been refurbished for 2013 season so felt
this must be of a good standard. It was sad however to see when we entered the
property that the flooring was worn badly in places and the double glazed
windows were completely shot and had condensation running down the insides. We
did notice this on other lodges also.

The lodge itself had obviously had a 'quick clean' prior to us entering but
needed a much more thorough clean for us to feel comfortable. We read other
reviews prior to coming with ref to cleaning so we bought with us cleaning
materials and set about giving the lodge a good cleaning! Just what you need to
start your holiday after a 5 hour drive.
Whilst we were doing this clean we noticed the shower door leaked and the toilet
seat needed tightening. The shower was very slippery also; so we went and bought
a internal rubber mat for that (surely its these missing touches that make it 'Gold?)

The kitchen was fairly well equipt and had a dishwasher that from the time we
arrived it had both red lights on to say it needed rinse aid and salt !!
(Surely this should be part of the cleaners role you do not expect to go on maintaing the dishwasher when you are here for one week only?)
However there was only just
enough plates and utensils to go around so you had to wait for the dishwasher to
finish; we solved this problem with buying paper plates.

Behind our lodge was a small outdoor heated pool which proved a hit with the
children, however it was sad to see that some of the tiles were cracked and it
was badly in need of some renovation.

One of our biggest disappointment was the Internet; the wifi was very hit and
miss and for £15.00 a day very expensive; surely in this day and age wifi should
be easily accessible and available for a nominal sum.

The weather was kind to us so we were able to get out and about, the park bus is
good value if you purchase a prepaid ticket for £10 for you all, if you don't it
is £4.00 per person. The bowling is very good fun; again we pre purchased family
bowling for just £10 when on site it is £19!
The arcade is fun for all. There were some kiddy go carts for £1.00 per go these
were great when they had been recharged, however they were not always so and you
can imagine the disappointment experienced by a 4 year old when he waited his
turn out his money in and it did not go (not to mention the agonising tears that
followed) Would be good if these were maintained as well as the ones on the
Twichen site we visited.

The shop on site was as it said and you could easily go to Tesco for your main
items. The cafe next door we did not use as the aroma of frying fat was evident
when you walked past.

We did not venture into the bar and entertainment area as it was very noisy and
not really our type of thing.

Our friends and their campervan were based at the other end of the resort, they
said that they felt they were in an area that resembled a refugee camp!

One thing we did notice that there were some unaccompanied young children
running around on this site which did not bode well for us at all. In the arcade
we asked one 4 year old who attached herself to my Grandson, where her Mummy and
Daddy was and she said in the caravan!!

For the price we paid £1100.00 for this accommodation I did not think the
accommodation was worth this at all.

If we compare this to a stay at Center Parcs, there is no comparison, Center
Parcs wins hands down, needless to say we will not be returning to Golden Coast",Date of stay: August 2013,Golden Coast Holiday Village,4,"Woolacombe, United Kingdom"
Did we book the wrong hotel?,"I have not written for tripadvisor for some while even though I have been away several times.
However I felt the need to do so now!!
I need to mention that we are seasoned travellers and have travelled all over the world.
Having just returned from our holiday at the Olympic Lagoon and Olympic Bay I felt it only fair to write this review in the hope it will assist others.

Following very good reviews on tripadvisor we decided to book the Olympic Lagoon resort and we were really looking forward to this excellent rated hotel for out family holiday, or so we thought?

I did email the hotel prior asking if it was possible that my husband and I would appreciate an upgrade (thinking of Fisherman's village!) dont get me wrong my husband and I were both very grateful for this upgrade and it must not detract at all from this review. I also checked my sent emails on return and on my reply I did state that I was travelling with my daughter and her family.

Upon entering the reception to the hotel my husband and I were very pleased to be asked if we would like to stay at the adults only part called Olympic Bay as it was our anniversary and what a wonderful pleasure this was; however from there on I felt as a family we were on two separate holidays!!

Checking in was fast and efficient and the staff were helpful and friendly. We received help with our luggage and we were all taken by different buggies to our rooms where the staff unloaded all the bags for us.

First I will comment on the Olympic Bay

This is situated across a busy main road out of the back from the main Olympic Lagoon hotel complex and it had 19 rooms. As the rooms faced the back of the hotel road noise was minimal and did not disturb at all. The Olympic Bay was in a beautiful setting just adjacent to the public beach and the room we were allocated was on the ground floor, very good for us both.
The room was of a high standard modern, comfortable and very clean throughout. They have the mini bar with water, coke and seven up and the waiter brings you bottles to restock daily, very nice touch.
Every day you are there; you are provided with cold fragranced towels, drinks, iced melon and afternoon cake all brought to you on your sun bed!
What a wonderful experience this was and I would like to thank Andras and Fanos for their continued service which is personal attention to detail not to mention the attention and advice on outside activities, also the freshly cooked food at the Bay which unfortunately stopped at 2.30pm!
There was no evening service and you had to go to the main hotel for any food or drink; no big deal really but an evening bar would not go amiss here.
The room maid was so pleasant and kept the room clean and the bathroom well stocked, and the room with tea and coffee, nice abundance of toiletries and fluffy towels including daily changed pool towels.
There is a lounge to relax in but it was little used in the day or night. Shame really as it was comfortable and well furnished. The pool was beautifully clean complete with spa taps for a rather nice massage.
Sun beds and umbrella's were of plenty; there was no need to be reserving beds at ridiculous times of the night or early morning. No matter what time you went to the pool there were always lots of beds and shady areas to choose from. The pool areas and bars were efficiently run and exceptionally clean.
Would we return as a couple; probably not as in the evening you either have to go out to eat to avoid the crowd or come at a time when the season is not so busy.

The Olympic Lagoon main resort Hotel.

My daughter and family were put at the main hotel in a ground floor room close to the kids clubs which expanded into two rooms with a sofa bed and put you up bed. Her children are 15 and 5ft 10"" and 4 years old so this extra bed was not ideal for the teenager and he soon began to complain of backache!

The bedrooms were quite small but fully equipped with kettle, tea and coffee etc, there was a standard hairdryer and a free mini bar which had coke, seven up, and water that would not be replenished. There was good air conditioning. The bathroom was small and this was badly in need of an update as it was smelly and had mildew; There was also a cracked sink which was replaced while my daughter was in the room (just what you need while on holiday!)
However, overall the room was clean, there was a hole evident in the deviding door.
The most difficult part of the room was the sofa bed, it was awfully uncomfortable for my Grandson.

My daughter was not at all pleased with the standard of this room it was more like a 3 star as was its location; as it was on the outer perimeter overlooking the motorway!
As we arrived at night it was difficult to see the position in relation to everything else and upon waking she decided that maybe facing out away from the crowds was beneficial after all!
She did however convey her disappointment in the calibre of the room to what we now find out is the reservations manager. My daughter was told 'you have what you paid for' we may be able to move you on Wednesday but this will cost you 88 euro and it was then Monday meaning she had to live out of suitcases! We were however happy to pay the extra. As the week went on the noise from other families became worse with unsupervised children banging on doors and slamming doors running up and down corridors also.

When we looked at the pictures of the hotel complex prior to booking; it looked to cover a vast amount of ground, however in reality it seemed very crammed in with little space.

The lazy river was exactly that and it took you ages to float around it.

We can wholeheartedly agree with the recent Tripadvisor review of 30th July 'Bit Chavvy' as we also noticed over the course of the fortnight the behaviour of the other guests, we also were one of the only ones in the dining room who didn't have a tattoo!
The lack of supervision from parents was also evident and we witnessed some very badly behaved children throughout the resort, so much so we spent our days on the beach which cost us a total of 22.50 euros per day, still it was worth it as the beach is ideal for young children. The entertainment for the little children in the evenings was good and our 4 year old loved the dancing. However there was little to offer following this except Bingo and internal entertainment.

At the main Olympic Lagoon pool which is open to all, the sunbathers were crammed and there were not enough sun beds to go round. As the first week went on this pool was very cramped indeed.
Getting a sun bed near to the pirate play ship was an impossibility and with reference to the above and badly behaved children without supervision; we choose the beach instead.The beach was near to the Olympic Bay but quite far from the Olympic Lagoon main dining room, especially for a 4 year old in the heat of the day; therefore my daughter and family bought their lunch at the beach most days.

On a positive note the food choice at the OL was good, the quality of the food was good and the service was second-to-none. Customer service is definitely this hotels strong point.

We dined in the Different Restaurants three times over the fourteen days and we liked the Captains table the best. The Japanese restaurant was not as we were used to so we gave that a miss for the second visit.

Weddings are on a conveyor belt one after the other; so lots of large family groups present.

So, on reflection if you want a relaxing holiday in a great location with nice people, then this is not really the place for you.
My daughter and her family feel that their holiday was definitely not worth the money paid which between us was in the region of £10k and they shall not be returning.

I would like to make a couple of suggestions;

First that this hotel does not split families in this way - yes upgrade but don't separate - we did speak to a number of guests at the Bay and it appeared none of them had paid any extra for this experience- in other words this is an 'overspill for the main hotel!!

Second that the adult pool up by reception, which was empty a lot of the time, be open to all in the height of the season as there are adult only pools at the bay and Fisherman's village ( so adults could be allowed to go there at the height of the season if they wish during that time)

Without doubt I must comment on the help and assistance received from Ele Guest Relations Manager who finally on the second week assisted my Daughter in relocating and moving to a somewhat decent suit of rooms which was of the standard she expected in the first place; and for securing a full size single bed for our 15 year old Grandson who at least had a few good nights sleep at the end of his holiday! Ele also aided us by letting him come to the Bay for his meals, which incidentally were freshly cooked as we are used to on holiday and served to you, he thought the food there was absolutely fab! Thank You Ele for trying your best for us all.

I also agree with the previous review and I could not have put it better myself - that if you are seeking a hi di hi type family hotel, then this place is for you.",Date of stay: July 2013,Olympic Lagoon Resort,4,"Ayia Napa, Cyprus"
Oh dear!,"I stayed here 3 nights on business in December, usually I stay at Holiday Inn Media City (which is superb) however no room at the Inn in December! so was offered the Copthorne at Salford Quays.
Big Mistake in accepting this offer.
Read recent reviews and requested views of quays room. Was then told it would cost me extra £25.00 per night to upgrade, decided to do this to club room. This was the first club room I have ever stayed in that had a thread bare carpet all the way enroute to the bathroom.
The room itself was warm and overall clean, but the TV and the room itself was very dated!
I ordered room service on day 2 and it arrived 'uncovered' and the soup was cold after the person who delivered the food made 4 different trips to the room to deliver the forgotten drink and remove the cold soup' I finally put the 'do not disturb' sign on the door as it was 9pm by now. I ordered a room service the next night (but could have done with a hot meal as it was -2 that night!) the food came the chips and meal was cold but I could not be bothered to complain again!
I commented on all of this to the receptionist on duty the next evening and she said I should of complained, however when you are out at 8am and not back till late as working; you are not inclined to comment any further!
