Great experience,"Small producer (10,000 bottles total- 2 whites and 1 red). Building dates back from 1350, beautiful rooftop looking at ocean with great breeze. A must do if visiting old town of Tinos (20 mins taxi drive 12 euros).",Date of experience: July 2019,Tinos: Private tour at Ballis Boutique Winery,5,"Tinos, Greece"
Great breakfast and pastries,"Must try their fruit yogurt- it is amazing. All of the pastries are fantastic- freshly made each morning. If staying in Imerovigli, it is a must stop for breakfast and pastry treats! Only downside is that they only accept cash (fairly common on the island).",Date of visit: July 2019,Ilios Bakery,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Fantastic food with great service,We truly enjoyed our dinner at Avocado; the owner/manager was attentive and friendly. All of our four meals were delicious- traditional moussaka was one of the best I have ever tasted. Moderately priced at great location if you are staying on the cliff of SANTORINi.,Date of visit: July 2019,Avocado Restaurant,5,"Santorini, Greece"
