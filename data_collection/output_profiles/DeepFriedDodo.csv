A Trip to Remember!,"This was a lovely day trip which ticked all the boxes. Antonia was an excellent host and catered for everyone's needs at all times. We were looked after from the second we stepped on board until after we'd returned home. We saw our lobster caught in front of our eyes, were able to take pictures with the lobster and witnessed the preparation. Whilst cooking was ongoing we were dropped off at a secluded beach only accessible by boat, where we could swim on the shores. Food was served with the most gorgeous fish soup made fresh from what was caught in the nets, rich lobster with pasta (for a first time eater) and finished with watermelon. This was all on top of the refreshments provided throughout the trip. On our return we witnessed how nets were relaid and we were given all the information we needed in perfect English. We were even lucky enough to have a few turtles circling the boat, alongside seeing all the fish in the crystal clear water. The trip was a delight, brilliant value for money and I would recommend to anyone.",Date of experience: July 2020,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
