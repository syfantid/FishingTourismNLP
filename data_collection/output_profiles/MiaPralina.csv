Really cosy!,"We decided to skip touristy Saranda and search and found this hidden gem! Small family run Itaka Hotel had all the peace and quiet we needed. Clean rooms and pool, god food and staff that was very helpful!",Date of stay: July 2019,Itaka Hotel,4,"Lukove, Albania"
"A ""Ryan Air"" Hotel","Very happily surprised with the food, fresh and with different main courses and desserts every night, and good breakfast. Not like a full buffet on a large hotel, but thats not to be expected.
Rooms are nice and clean, pool is large and quiet. We chosed half board, so we didnt spend much time in the bar area, but will give an extra hug to breakfast hostess and barmaid Nektarina, for being extremely friendly and nice.

The strangest thing with the hotel was that the manager didnt hesitate to scream to the staff, in front of the guests, what she expected them to do in order to save money. There was a price list for everything above the basics, i.e, if you want a fridge in the room, 5 Euro/ night, air condition, 8 Euro/ night. There was also a list of the costs of accidently breaking things as a glass in the restaurant, 3 euro. It was like a ""Ryan Air Hotel""- only the very basics are included. Surprised that toilet paper were not charged for....",Date of stay: July 2018,Happy Days Hotel,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Amazing!,"Best thing we did in the whole week! Extremely friendly staff.
One person in our company chosed chicken instead of fish for the meal. When time came for cooking, the captain realized that he forgot to bring chicken. We told him that it was okay, but he sent an employee swimming to the shore to pick up chicken brought there from another member of the staff, and then he swom back to the boat with the chicken held above the surface.
Just 11 people on board at the time makes it nice. Bring water, since the only drink included is with the meal at the end of the trip.",Date of experience: July 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Hotel for Russians only,"Almost no one in the hotel speaks English. Evening shows are in Russian, as are all signs. Food in the pool bar is out from 8 am, and until 4 pm- in 35 degrees! Drinks are served in tacky thin small plastic cups, not reusable. One person could easily use 50 cups a day, such a waste.
While we were in the pool, a family occupied our chairs and took our towels, and when we tried to get them back they screamed in Russian, like if they expected that also every other guest should speek their language.
The food was nice looking but tasteless. The room was okay but the ""extra bed"" our son was expected to sleap in was a sofa, not longer than 120 cm.

We spend most of the time in the lobby bar, where the service was okay.",Date of stay: July 2018,Armas Kaplan Paradise,4,"Tekirova, Turkey"
Love the staff and the food!,"We got out of our lousy all-inclusive hotel to get a proper meal, and found this pearl! The food was excellent and the staff so friendly. The owners of this family-run restaurant has really succeeded with both the cooking and with rising their family.

Reasonable prices too, and the kids got special little extras with their food.",Date of visit: July 2018,Mimoza,4,"Tekirova, Turkey"
"Thank you, Sara!","We stayed a night at the ""Hilton of tents"" in the Golan, and we wish we had the time to stay much longer! Really wonderful place, beautiful area and an amazingly helpful and brave owner. She had no hesitiation to answer any of our many questions, and if she wasn't sure of the answer, she immediatly called a relative to find out. We are so glad we went to beautiful Golan, and even more happy we choose to stay in Ghengis Khan! The campground is located really close to a lot of really great hiking places, so if you are looking for a great base for hiking adventures, this is it!",Date of stay: June 2014,Genghis Khan In The Golan,4,Givat Yoav
