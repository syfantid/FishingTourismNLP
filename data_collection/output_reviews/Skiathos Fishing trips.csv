0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nogah875,October 2020,5,Boat trip with Dimitris,"We had a blast with Dimitris! Spent a full day on his boat traveling from one amazing beach to another. Dimitris spoiled us with food and drinks and taught us about the area and sea life. Our kids (7 and 10) had a joy and loved it so much that we ""had"" to book another day with Dimitris!  During the trip I lost my wedding ring in the sea and a day later Dimitris went back to that place and found it which was insane.. I have no idea how he managed to do it and it just shows what a great guy he is and how much he cares! I highly recommend this boat trip!‚Ä¶"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/726jadeh,August 2020,5,Best day of our holiday ‚ù§ ,"This was our second trip out with Dimitris and this time we had a 14 year old with us & fair to say we all agreed this was the best day of our holiday (and we're only half way though!)  Highlights included snorkeling & watching Dimitris dive for urchins and oysters. Dimitris caught a small octopus that we were able to pet. While on the boat we ate the freshest urchins, oysters, breem, prawns and fruit salad. The whole day was fantastic and I couldn't recommend it enough. ‚Ä¶"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelhD5718GA,August 2020,5,Best day everrrrrr,"This was hands down our best day of the holiday. Dimitris fed us from the second we stepped aboard the Alexander till the moment we disembarked 8 hours later. We had pastries fresh caught urchins, prawns, sea bream & beautiful fresh fruit platter, the compliment to this was an open bar with water & soft drinks for our teen. We had the most amazing eight hours visiting beautiful beaches inc Lalaria which was breath taking. I would definitely recommend this trip & will definitely be back, thank you Dimitris for making our holiday in Skiathos a memorable one.‚Ä¶"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/728georgek,August 2020,5,An excursion to remember,"We had our trip 4 days ago with a group of 6. Something you shouldn't miss in Skiathos. A beautiful experience which we love in every second.  We discovered places we haven't been plus we had some stops at Tsugrias and Lalaria. We had beautiful lunch cooked by captain Dimitris and amazing fruits salads. What you will expect is ....swimming at the most beautiful places on Skiathos,  some snorkeling,  delicious meal, drinks and of course dont forget to capture some beautiful skiathos spots. Highly recommend ‚ù§üôè‚Ä¶"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/athanasiosk592,August 2020,5,Best day of our vacations,"Me and my girlfriend wanted to have a private relaxed day around Skiathos and the nearby islands as too take fool advantage of the beauty Skiathos has to offer but is accessible only by boat. I spoke with Dimitris on the phone and he was very clear on what our day plan would be. We met in the morning and the amazing experience began! Got our coffee, relaxed on the comfy seats and sailed away... We visited many beaches, caves where we got to swim all the way at the end, had amazing food and live sea food from the bottom of the sea! Dimitris is an amazing captain! We had a lot of fun, interesting discusions and info of the places we visited. After the trip we had a coffee all together and Dimitris helped us taking our staff to the main port as we were going to the mainland the same day and got us a souvenir!! Also it was just me my gf and 2 Italian friends, so it was really relaxed. As I noticed other boats were really crowded and commercial. Next time we will be in Skiathos we will definitely join him for another day in paradise!‚Ä¶"
