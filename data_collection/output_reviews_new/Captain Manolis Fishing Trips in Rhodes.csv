1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Becka01,August 2020,5,Fabulous day out! ,"We had such a fantastic time Yesterday! We arrived early and my partner messaged himTo say we were there so he came early to save us waiting. The captain was kind and patient, especially with me as I won’t ever make a pro fisher! But we had so much fun- even when we caught the puffer fish which was a pleasure to see! Ironically I won’t go in the sea because I’mScared of fish touching my feet but my partner and the kids loved going for their swim! The food made for us was so fresh and cooked to perfection! We had such a lovely day. Thank you so much! I would most certainly book this trip again, even if I am crap at fishing ha ha! "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/810jeanetten,August 2020,5,Exhilarating,It was a exhilarating experience being able to drive a speed boat. My 14 year old son suggested this to me and I'm so glad I did it.
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alinach5,July 2020,5,Amazing trip!,"Captain Mike is a real professional captain, fisher man, chef and a very nice person!We had an amazing and wonderful trip, a very tasty lunch and of course a great fishing!We will come back! Dear Mike, thank you very much! "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luka13f,August 2019,3,Overpromising but fairly priced,"Fishing experience is below average, boat is small and quite unstable, half of guests were feeling sick. Biggest fish we caught was 15cm, don’t believe what you see in the pics. Most of the time we were catching tiny blowfish. Bright side is captain Mike who cooked an amazing lunch with fish they bring from the fish store... not even caught in Greece if I understood correctly. Overall good value for price but if you are looking for fishing experience, look elsewhere."

Captain mike was very good and helpful and was there whenever a fish was hooked in our rods to take it and put further baits .He cooked a wonderful bbq while we swam in the sea and we have never tasted such an amazing mouth watering grilled fish....A good and amazing trip and thank you captain
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philsC8102QI,July 2019,5,Grand Day Out,"We spent a fantastic day out on this trip paying €190 for the four of us. We were picked up from our hotel, which for a small company was a really nice touch. The boat sets off from Collona harbour and takes about 30 mins to reach the fishing area. Captain Mixhaillis was great at showing us how to bait and fish and was very patient with us when things were not going well!  We fished for around two hours catching a variety of small fish and some larger puffer fish unwelcome visitors from the red Sea. We then took a trip closer to shore where we swam and waited while the captain prepared a fantastic fish barbecue and salad for us. This was a cracking day out and we couldn't have been better looked after!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smel62,July 2019,5,Fishing with Captain Manolis ,"Booked this as my partner loves fishing, but I don’t but said would give it a go. I absolutely loved it. Captain Mihalis was so patient, knowledgeable, had your safety at the forefront of his thoughts, and made this experience truly memorable. We had about 3 hours of fishing then some time for swimming while Mihalis bbq’d the fish for us. He served this up with a delicious Greek salad and Greek bread. If you want a few hours of fun and a great meal to boot, I recommend this trip! "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peacock143,June 2019,5,Loved every minute,"This trip was brilliant. I’d never fished before but Captain Mixalis was very knowledgable and patient. The views from the boat, the swimming experience and bbq were second to none. Of all the trips you get hassled for when walking through the port this was by far the best. Ended up Facebook friends with the captain, sharing all our photos and a trip we’ll never forget. "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CenAbeach,May 2019,5,Great Fishing Trip and an amazing BBQ,"At the end of May 2019 we were guests on the boat of Captain Manolis.  We were together with 3 other guests of different nationalities.  It was a fantastic afternoon.  The group was perfect and very pleasant.  Quite a lot of fish was caught.  The captain was always helpful in catching the hooks and handling the fish.  Enjoyed a fantastic barbecue and a delicious cold beer at the end of the afternoon.  The boat trip was very nice, given the opportunity to swim in the clear blue sea.  Highly recommended .C&A"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kkj25,May 2019,5,Brilliant ! ,"Great value for money. We paid 45euros each, which included around 3 hours of fishing, time to swim in the sea and a fish lunch cooked on the BBQ. We had the boat to ourselves (5 family members along with the captain), which was a great experience. The only down side was that the boat was very small (I’d say no more than 8 people would fit) and I was hoping we would taste some of the fish we caught. Other than that it was a brilliant day out with a very helpful captain. - There is a small toilet on board "

The boat captain was very professional and cooked the best fish lunch on the boat made from fresh fish. For me it was the first time but my friend had Done this in Thailand, this trip is greece was better she said"

3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelM6738,August 2018,5,Amazing experience,Fishing trip with Captain Michalis is a great experience if you are going to visit Rodos.We visited many beautiful natural harbours which we wouldnt be able to find otherwise and learned a lot of things about fishing from a truly fishing Guru and great host. Totally recomended and we will be back for sure next time we visit Rhodes.*****
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ingermariebu,July 2018,5,A lot of funn for all ages,"Best thing to do when you are in Rhodes. My son (10 years) loved this tour. We were in Rhodes in July. It was good to get some ocean breeze in the hair and to cool of on a boat trip. Captain Manolis is the best! He was so good with the kids and he gave us an experience and knowledge for life! During summertime the fish isn’t that big, but who cares when you are having such a good time. While the Captain was preparing the food, we had time to go swimming in the ocean. The water was clear, and I recommend you bring diving masks. The fish and salad on the bout were so delicious. During 8 days in Rhodes we went on this trip 4 times. We are coming back next time we are visiting Rhodes!"
