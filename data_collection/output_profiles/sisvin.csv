Dangerous for small children - avoid paxos antipaxos sarris cruises,"I took this cruise with my young children who are 13 years and 7 years old. The ferry parked in antipaxos near the beach where the people were allowed to enter the sea and swim. We need to climb down a 1 metre ladder and then enter the sea to swim. Some people were jumping from the top of the ladder into the sea. My 7 year old son who is a recent swimmer went with his 13 year old sister ahead in the queue and he jumped into the sea from the ladder. As only 1 person can come down the ladder I was a few places behind in the queue. The ladder is 1 metre length and as he jumped from top he went bit deep down in the water on landing and this made him worry and panic and he lost his confidence. My 13 year old daughter who jumped after him found him in distress and as she approached him he just clanged to her and both started to drown. I was few spaces back in the queue with my other twin girl who is 7 and didn’t know about it. By the time I came down the ladder on my back to the sea ( so I didn’t see what happened down) and put the daughter in the sea with a float, I saw another guy holding up my son. I quickly reached him and both of us together was able to get him to the yellow buoy lines and make him hold the same and float. I told the guy that I need help to get him back to the ship as I cannot leave the girl on the float alone at sea with my 13 year old one. I made both children hold the lines and was looking for help. No one from the ship noticed or came for help even though my partner requested a guy onboard. I told the guy who hold my child that I need help and he went back to the ship and bought a buoy from the ship. I put my son on the buoy and then brought him back to the ship . While I was hugging him and making him comfortable, a lady supervisor came and ask me are you the parent of the child and how many of you are there. I told her that we are 5 members and the 2 young children are with me. she said the buoy was captains property and I should not have taken it without their permission. I told her that i used it in an emergency but she was repeating the same thing. She also said that they don’t have any responsibility for people entering the sea and they don’t care about their safety and I entered the sea on my responsibility. I was bit upset by this as they were not worried about my child's safety and also by her statement that people enter the sea at their risks. As the ferry owners they have to warn that the sea is deep and it is not safe always to enter. Also there should have some supervision as incidents like this can happen.

I find the following things totally unacceptable and unsafe.

I have been in ferry in rhodes and had visited the symi island trip. The ferry boat was small and there was a platform from where you could enter the sea and so there was no need to jump into the sea from heights. Also the company provided floats and life jackets for weak swimmers. No floats or life jackers were provided by this ferry and I strongly believe this is very unsafe . I saw the corfu cruises which was parked nearby offering floats to the swimmers. This makes children more safe . Swimmimg in the sea is the only fun part of these cruises and the company should have made this enjoyable with safety precautions.

2 The ferry should not allow people to jump from the ladder as it is unsafe. They should supervise this as people can slip and fall head down to the sea.

3 There should be a few people supervising and watching the swimmers in the seas to see whether they all are safe. The ferry company cannot say that it is not their responsibility when people enter the sea when they offer this as a part of the package. The blue water is so tempting to enter and it is their responsibility to at least warn people before entering as it is quite deep ( about 3metres)

There was only 1 life buoy tied to a string in the water and this was not enough for about 150 people aboard and the around 100 in the sea. They should have more buoys in water for use in case of an emergency and there should also be life jackets near the entrances in case of an emergency.

My son had a very bad experience and it took a few days for us to make him regain confidence and enter a beach or pool again. I will never recommend this trip for families with children and I hope the cruise company read this and make the necessary safety features available in future. I will prefer a much smaller cruise company like corfu cruises who will look after their passengers than to a big ferry like sarris in future. It was a lesson learnt with much difficulty and worries.",Date of experience: August 2019,Sarris Cruises,1,"Corfu, Greece"
Fantastic experience for kids,"We just went for the fishing trip today and it was really nice. Captain mike was very good and helpful and was there whenever a fish was hooked in our rods to take it and put further baits .

He cooked a wonderful bbq while we swam in the sea and we have never tasted such an amazing mouth watering grilled fish....

A good and amazing trip and thank you captain",Date of experience: July 2019,Captain Manolis Fishing Trips in Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
