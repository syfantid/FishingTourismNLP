Great fishing trip!,"Since we went in the end of the season, we had the opportunity to go on the fishing trip alone as a couple.

First, the captain navigated us to some places to take nice pictures of the old town of Rhodos. After the photo's we went further on the sea to fish.
I'd never fished before, but the captain took the time to teach me how to fish.
I really appreciated that!
After fishing the captain prepared the fish we caught on the BBQ , and we went for a swim. The meal he cooked tasted excellent!

We really enjoyed the trip and would definitely recommend it to friends!",Date of experience: October 2017,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
