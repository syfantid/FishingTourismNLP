That was fun!,"Being someone who kayaks back home in the Norfolk Broads UK, I couldn't pass up the opportunity of seeing Rhodes from the same perspective. This was great fun - and ALOT cooler that being stuck on dry land! You do not need to be an expert either so this is perfect for even for a beginner. Great guide, great conversation & lots of opportunities to snorkel. Very knowledgeable in legends & myths too. You're in safe hands - Recommended!!",,Rhodes Full-Day Sea-Kayaking Adventure Including Lunch,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
Ahoy there!,"Give these guys a call, Had a great time fishing out at sea - you'll be well looked after & the food is great. Plus a great opportunity to take a dip whilst they're cooking for you. Above all they're great fun to be with & very knowledgeable & you'll be making international fishing friends very quickly!",Date of experience: October 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
Lunch just in the right place...,"A very relaxing & excellent meal, & was certainly not feeling hustled into eating there. Great staff too - & only attentive as you want them to be! I had stuffed squid & a beer - It was awesome , read a bit and almost forgot where I was. They have a winning formula! Will definitely return before I fly back",Date of visit: October 2019,Nimmos Traditional Restaurant,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
