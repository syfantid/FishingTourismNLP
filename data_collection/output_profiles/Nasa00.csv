Very nice trip,"Maria and Gerasimos are very warm and interesting people. There was plenty of fresh and delicious food, all made by Gerasimos. The beaches that we visited were beautiful and non-crowded. The sea was calm. We enjoyed our trip a lot and would definitely recommed it to others!",Date of experience: September 2020,Poseidon Fishing Tourism Kefalonia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
