Great food,Went here twice and the food was fantastic both times! Highly recommended and great value for money with our lovely main dishes being less than 10 euro !,Date of visit: June 2019,Maria's Taverna,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
The highlight of our trip to Kefalonia!!,"My wife and I enjoyed a fantastic trip yesterday with Dimitrios and Efi. My wife isn’t massively into fishing but loved it because whilst some of the trip is reeling in the nets (people can be as involved as they want to in this...or not) the rest of the trip was swimming in amazing areas only reached by boat and snorkelling around the area. We both had a fantastic day and our best meal of the trip was one Efi cooked on board from the catch.

Highly recommended to anyone and the hosts couldn’t be friendlier.

Amazing view and food....service A+++,We tried this spot having read the reviews on here and we were not disappointed. An idyllic setting up high and the food was wonderful. The experience was all topped off by a family run friendly service. We couldn’t recommend it enough and will definitely be back!,Date of visit: June 2019,Old Times,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic 2 night stay,"We are on our way back to London from a fantastic bank holiday weekend stay here.

From the moment you walk through the door they management and staff could not be more friendly and helpful. From tips and tricks re going around exploring town to advice re transport they were a great help.

I couldn't fault it in anyway and would highly recommend it. Breakfast was especially good with a wide range of options and breakfast specials.
