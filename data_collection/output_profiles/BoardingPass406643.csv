Very bad,"Horrible interior in very old planes, long delays, terrible communication, no online check in. For connecting flights through Thessaloniki, passengers need to exit the area and repeat both check in and control.",Date of travel: July 2019,Ellinair,1,World
Amazing boat experience,"We went there last August, we were a company of four (two couples), and totally six guests (i.e., the boat is not crowded). A very special boat trip with local fishermen in a very hospitable and warm atmosphere. We stopped by various majestic beaches of the island without rush, swam, fished, cooked, and had an awesome fresh fish lunch on the boat. Totally recommended.",Date of experience: August 2018,Milos Fishing Trip,1,"Milos, Greece"
