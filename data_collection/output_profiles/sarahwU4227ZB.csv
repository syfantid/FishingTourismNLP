Lovely beachside dining,"We visited the taverna on our second evening in Katelios. We have eaten at the Grillhouse for years so knew Sadie & Ilias always serve delicious food. The Taverna has been run by Ilias’ parents for years and the experience shows. The menu is quite extensive, especially in Covid-19 times when everyone seems to be operating a restricted menu. We had a bit of a blowout and ordered lots of dishes, we had the garlic pita bread, the skordalia, the grilled halloumi, chicken souvlaki and the shrimp saganaki. It was all delicious. Will definitely be back next year.",Date of visit: August 2020,Katelios Taverna,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best moussaka in the whole of Greece,"We have been coming to Katelios for many years and only recently discovered Persas’ and what a gem it is! The staff are so lovely, the setting is beautiful and the food is delicious! The moussaka is the best I have had anywhere in Greece, as is the skordalia.
Sophia, Angeline and Olga are constantly on the go, making sure everyone is happy and attended to. Sophia and Angeline’s father is an absolute delight, we caught him ‘testing’ the swing on one visit and he is so good with the patron’s children, my heart could actually melt!
During the course of our visits we ate stuffed vine leaves, grilled feta, local lamb in the oven, rabbit, olives, skordalia, chicken souvlaki, meatballs, lemon pie, orange cake and every dish was delicious and beautifully presented.
On our final visit they had a man playing an acoustic guitar and coupled with the waterfall, beautiful lighting, friendly cats and the sound of the cicadas it set the perfect ambience. Can’t wait to be back there next year.",Date of visit: September 2020,Persas Taverna,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Great food, slow service","Our first visit here and I’m sure it won’t be our last. The food is great, however the service is incredibly slow. Upon arrival we were advised there was about a 20 minute wait for a table and food would take about 40 minutes. I could see about 5 or 6 tables free just needing a clean so decided to take a seat in the waiting area with about 5 or 6 other groups. The waiting staff seemed to be wandering around aimlessly.
We got a seat after about 30 minutes with the waitress telling us she would be back shortly to take our drinks order, 20 minutes went by and she hadn’t returned. Eventually I managed to make eye contact with another waitress who took our order. The food we ordered (blueberry pancake breakfast) and the grand slam breakfast) was really nice. However trying to get anyone’s attention for a coffee refill and the subsequent bill was a nightmare.
I have given it 3 stars as the food was delicious but if you are in a hurry I certainly wouldn’t recommend it!",Date of visit: June 2019,Denny's,4,"Renfrew, United Kingdom"
Ideal beach for families,"Lovely sandy beach with ample sun loungers and parasols. I can imagine the parking getting slightly chaotic during the busier summer months but we had no problem at all. Nice couple of tavernas a few metres away from the beach with showers etc Lovely and shallow water, perfect for water babies young and old, because it was so shallow it was relatively warm too.",Date of experience: June 2019,Kaminia Beach,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Great food, wonderful staff","Katelios Grill House may be small in size but it packs a punch when it comes to quality of food, warmth of welcome and authentic Greek charm. Everything is very reasonably priced, with new favourite dishes discovered every year (this year was the spaghetti shrimp saganaki).
Owned by Ilias and Sadie this is a family-run business with family ethics with the patrons treated like old friends. They are supported by some amazing staff including the lovely Alice and Sait and some very talented chefs.
We have never had a bad meal there in the 5 years we have been coming to Katelios. Everything is cooked perfectly and the portions are very generous. Also it is the only place in Katelios we have found to sell our beloved Fanta Blue!
Can’t wait to see you all again next year! ❤️",Date of visit: June 2019,Katelios Grill House,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Every year gets better and better!,"This was our 7th trip in 3 years with Efi & Dimitris and as in previous years it was the best day of our holiday by an absolute mile! You never know what interesting people you are going to meet on the boat, taking a maximum of 12 people the group size is perfect for getting to know your fellow fishermen and women for the day. Giggles galore and the freshest, prettiest food in the whole of Kefalonia.
The swim stops were well thought out, avoiding the busier tourist beaches and heading instead to some hidden little gems, accessible only by boat allowing us to swim in crystal clear water in peace and privacy.
Whilst on the boat the crew are very knowledgable about the fish that come on board, ensuring safety at all times but keeping the atmosphere relaxed and fun. It is truly a learning experience of traditional Greek fishing, allowing you to see the wide variety of marine life on the island close up. On each trip we always seem to find something new, from lobsters, crabs, rays, barracuda, snapper, mullet, stargazers, hake, bream, parrot fish, eels, scorpion fish and our personal favourite this year the flying fish (which was released back to the Ionian sea) to name but a few.
The boat is impeccably clean for a working boat with facilities available on board. We were served a feast of freshly caught, freshly cooked and locally sourced food by our hosts, washed down by homemade lemonade (a firm favourite every year), homemade wine, Greek beer or soft drinks. There is something for everyone on this trip. The fishing tourism business has become quite a competitive market in Kefalonia but Efi & Dimitris are the original and best. Their 100% positive genuine reviews speak for themselves with people returning year after year.
Already looking forward to next year’s trip!",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Home from home,"We always stay at Eryphilli when we come to Kefalonia and haven’t got a bad word to say about the place. We have stayed here 5 times now and consider it our home from home.
Nicos and his family are a joy to stay with. Always welcoming and friendly, nothing is too much trouble. Lucy (Nicos’ wife) is the best cook! I would be the size of a house if she was MY wife! Can only assume Nicos stays so slim keeping his poolside in pristine condition and running around after the guests haha He is on the go from 7:00am until gone midnight.
The apartments are basic but you have everything you need. The Breadhouse bakery is a few yards down the road as is the mini market.
The residents cats are delightful, will miss them all terribly when we go home on Saturday.",Date of stay: June 2018,Eryphilli,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best souvlaki plate on the island!,"Ilias, Sadie, Alice and the team at the Grill House have once again made our holiday one to remember. The food here is delicious, the souvlaki plate and gyros pitta is to die for! The nightly specials are varied and everything is very reasonably priced. Unlike some places on the island the local cats aren’t shooed away and will happily sit around your feet while you eat. We would often give them tit bits from our plate which were gratefully received. Already can’t wait to go back next year!",Date of visit: June 2018,Katelios Grill House,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best day of our holiday,"This is the second year running we have been on a fishing cruise with Efi and Dimitris and it was just as good as we remembered! You feel part of a team from start to finish.
Efi is the hostess with the mostess! :)
From getting the fish out of the nets, to the beautiful swim stops, the homemade lemonade and wine, the delicious fresh fish lovingly cooked onboard the potato salad, the information about the island and it’s marine life, everything about the whole day was perfect.",Date of experience: June 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Cannot recommend highly enough!,"I have to say, in all the years we have been coming to Kefalonia this is the BEST and funniest daytrip I have ever been on thanks to our wonderful hosts Efi Bacha Takidou and Dimitris Takidis and our lovely new friends Victoria, Simon, Sharon and Keith. We made the best memories with the best people.
If you are ever in the area please check out Fishing Tourism and Cruises Kefalonia, these guys are amazing. My cheeks actually hurt from smiling so much!
We met at Katelios harbour just before 08:00 and were met with baked goods, Greek coffee and were introduced to our crew. Efi was the hostess with the most-ess, teaching us how to untangle the fish from the nets, telling us the type of fish we were dealing with (whilst making sure we stayed away from the poisonous scorpion fish!), serving us the most delicious homemade lemonade. The food was prepared for us while we snorkelled at a secluded private beach. Dimitri was fascinating to watch as he prepared the fish for cooking. We enjoyed several platters of the fish we had caught that morning along with fresh Greek salad, Efi's homemade potato salad and delicious anchovies. Dessert was a fresh fruit salad washed down with wine and ouzo.
We returned to Katelios at 15:00 with full stomachs, grinning from ear to ear with wonderful memories of the perfect day and new friendships formed. We have already booked to go again tomorrow! Simply cannot wait!",Date of experience: June 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Island Tour with the Basil Fawlty of tour guides,"So yesterday was an interesting day.... We signed up to the Island Tour with Panem. The last time we were here we went with their wonderful tour guide Esme on a delightful tour of the Robola winery and the local churches and monasteries. Sadly Esme has retired and yesterday we met her replacement, Anthony. The 2 guides could not have been more different. Esme had been knowledgable, engaging, enthusiastic, warm with a clear love for the island. Anthony was the Basil Fawlty of tour guides! You were made to feel guilty for being on the trip (if the large number of attendees was really that stressful he should be raising it with his employer Panem who took our euros and put us all on the trip!) He was rude, boring, read 'interesting facts' from sheets of paper with the warm delivery and personality of Teresa May, made inappropriate comments, was negative throughout and had zero personality or charm. It was clearly just a job to him and our 48 strong group were made to feel like an inconvenience. Maybe he was on the 'manopause' I don't know, but we definitely won't be going on any further trips he is involved with.
I would rather have skipped the talk about bees and spent longer in Asos if I'm honest. I have given the trip 2/5 as despite Anthony the places we saw were lovely Asos, Fiskardo, Melissani Lake and Drogorati Caves were all superb.",Date of experience: June 2017,Panem Day Trips,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
