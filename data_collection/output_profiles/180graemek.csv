Truly memories made for life...,"We have been in Kefalonia for about 10 days now (5 more to go...). During that time my wife and I have packed in a multitude of activities in order to entertain our kids (13 and 1) but also to scratch our own cultural interests. The Poseidon Fishing Adventure (adventure is the correct word) ticks all the boxes and I do not say it lightly when I define the trip as one of the best family holiday experiences I've ever had.

The day started meeting the boat at Lixouri harbour. The Poseidon vessel itself has oodles of charm and as the day goes on you'll come to appreciate that it reflects the captain of the ship well. Captain Gerasimos himself is a charming and humble character and definitely made maximum effort to enhance our day.

After initial meet and greet we were presented with breakfast. Cereal was available for the kids and more importantly, coffee for the adults. Setting sail with a cup of coffee in hand on a sunny morning is right up there in terms of satisfaction! There was also cake, toast and bread available with a wide range of jams/butter etc.

After sailing out for a bit Captain Gerasimos then cast the 1km long nets in the hunt for our lunch. The kids were mesmerised seeing the equipment in full flow and there was great excitement as tge nets reeled in. Shrimp, fish of different kinds as well as a few treasures from the deep were caught. You can pitch in to pull the fish from the nets and give a bit more interaction to your experience.

When that was done Captain Gerasimos gave us a go at line fishing. My son caught 7 fish, me just 1! A great experience overall and something I'm now itching to try again.

We were then taken to a secluded beach only reachable by boat. We had this to ourselves for over an hour whilst lunch was prepared for us. Inflatables and snorkelling gear were provided to keep the kids (& adults!)happy.

Lunch was a joy. The fish was delicious and served with a large salad. Following this we were treated to delicious shell fish and then a shrimp/spaghetti dish. This washed down well with the white wine served. Overall I think I ate my body weight in seafood.

The day may seem like a long one (8:30-4pm) but genuinely the time passed so quickly. The whole family loved it and could not recommend highly enough.

Essential fine dining in the city centre,"My family and I were lucky to try out Otro soon after it launched. We have frequented the other establishment that is run by the management team (New Chapter) so were pretty sure we could expect a fabulous meal. Thankfully we were not disappointed.

Initially before the food has been ordered and arrived you are taken with the fresh decor, in particular the walls in the room we ate in had really beautifully designed wallpaper giving the place a very fresh and new feel.

Service overall was prompt - I would say that perhaps the dishes were slow to come out however I would put this down to the restaurant being newly opened and working its way through the process. For future visits I would expect this to not be an issue anymore.

For lunch I had a beautiful Confit Duck hash which came with a red cabbage slaw. My partner treated herself to a Macaroni dish made with truffle oil. The taste in both dishes was superb and excellently balanced. Overall the presentation was exquisite and the size of the portion was just enough to feel full enough that you could be tempted by dessert but wouldn't feel like you would go hungry if you didn't go for dessert.

In the end we opted for dessert anyway! For myself I had the rhubarb cheesecake whilst my partner enjoyed a Mandarin cake with an orange custard. The cheesecake came with a ginger ice cream which was superb, in addition to this it also came with crisp shape and style meringues. These are a nice take on meringues and compliment the tart rhubarb cheesecake nicely.

I am told the Mandarin cake and custard was excellent - I did not get a chance to have a taste of this one as it was so delicious and apparently not for sharing!

Superb new restaurant and the menu invites a return visit in the near future.",Date of visit: March 2017,Otro,4,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Best for business in Swindon,"1. There's a pokestop over the road. Such things are important in the summer of 2016.
2. The dinner menu is varied and not the usual onslaught of burgers and their variants.
3. The staff are attentive and appropriately chatty.
4. Decent nights sleep thanks to cosy bed.
5. The bar has excellent range of beers. Including some German beer...not the usual hotel standard of Stella/john Smith etc.
6. Excellent location for onward exploration into town centre.
7. It has a car park!",Date of stay: July 2016,Jurys Inn Swindon,4,"Swindon, United Kingdom"
Taste buds thoroughly satisfied,"We had a family dinner here and I'm glad we did as it meant I got to try different dishes from our parties varying plates. The dishes themselves are clearly constructed and put together in a thoughtful way that delivers the best taste sensation. For myself I had the scallops to start which were served with a beautiful relish. For my main I had the venison which was presented beautifully alongside a sauerkraut pithivier. For a side I also had the Kale with roasted chestnuts. This was the first time I'd ever tasted chestnuts and they instantly became a favourite. The mandarin cake to finish with chocolate and orange ice cream was rich, but not too rich that you felt it was over powering. Satiated is the perfect word to describe it.
There really wasn't anything on the menu that I wouldn't have eaten and the service was exceptional.
I'd definitely recommend forking out for the 3 courses as the whole meal from start to finish feels like a journey of taste.",Date of visit: November 2015,New Chapter,4,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
A real gem in the woodland of Midlothian,"My step-son and I stayed here for a night prior to my wedding day. We were welcomed with warmth and had our biscuits in the room topped up promptly after my son had 'called dibs' on the chocolate biscuits.
The room itself was very comfortable and we both slept very well. I genuinely couldn't nit pick anything to detract from an optimum service.
Breakfast was made by Jim who claimed it was normally someone else that made the breakfasts however you couldn't tell as it was very tasty.
In addition my son was given a constant supply of sweet treats to keep a smile on his face.

The friendliness of the host is also to be commended.

Superb place and highly recommended.",Date of stay: September 2015,Greenlees Lodge,4,"Lasswade, United Kingdom"
