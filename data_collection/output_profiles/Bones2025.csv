Boat trip unlike any other!,"Such a beautiful trip! All of the wonderful things you’ll read on here are absolutely true, it’s a really magical day! Do it if you get a chance!

This was our second amazing trip with Efi and Dimitrios and we will be taking a third with them when we return next year for sure.

We travelled as a family of 4 with 2 children who just loved watching to see what the catch that day contained as did we, it’s absolutely fascinating!
Mohammad (the most patient, lovely, gentle man) spent a good hour with our children showing them how to get the fish out of the nets. He was just so gorgeous with the children as were Efi and Dimitrios as always! We all felt very relaxed and so well looked after. Nothing was too much trouble.

Efi is the most amazing cook. It’s incredible to see what she can create on the boat. We ate some seriously delicious fish and were lucky enough to try some slipper lobster as there was one within the catch that day.
We stopped at 2 really beautiful beaches for swimming and snorkelling and had a natural mud bath on one too.
Thank you all for helping us make some wonderful holiday memories. See you in 2020.
