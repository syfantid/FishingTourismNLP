Fishing only part of the fun!!,"A wonderful day on board this boat, with fantastic hosts Dimitrios and Efi. The day started out with a cruise of only half an hour or so to where the nets were laid, then came the anticipation of seeing the nets hauled up and everyone mucking in to get the catch out of the net. Many different kinds of fish, slipper lobsters, cuttlefish and crabs were all hauled up, and Efi was really keen to point out any interesting specimens. The flying fish were especially colourful. After the catch was in, a short sail brought us to a small beach where you could go for a swim, or walk on the beach, making sure not to disturb the turtle nests which could be seen from the trails left up the beach by the female turtles hauling themselves out.
Back on the boat then for a short sail to some caves where we were lucky to see the critically endangered Mediterranean Monk Seal, then on to the last beach for more swimming and mud baths, followed by a magnificent lunch of the fish that had been caught that morning with Efi's beautiful fresh salads and wine from their own grapes. After lunch, more swimming and then a slow cruise back to Katelios for the end of a great day..",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
