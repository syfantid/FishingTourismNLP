Dump,"Bearing in mind we are in the middle of a Pandemic you’d think they’d be keen to keep their jobs. No. Miserable , slow service. The tables were filthy. I had to ask for one to be cleaned. Even then she didn’t bother cleaning any others , only the one I was to sit at. All were filthy. The Burger was lukewarm. Avoid this flea pit.",Date of visit: November 2020,Burger King,1,"Darlington, United Kingdom"
Best cafe in Darlington,"Our first visit. I had a super Goats cheese, Beetroot and Quinoa salad. I followed this with Gluten Free Lemon Drizzle cake. It was all excellent. The service was too. So refreshing to get good gluten free cakes.",Date of visit: March 2020,Influence cafe,1,"Darlington, United Kingdom"
Superb,The whole experience was excellent. I booked online and my wife is GF. This was no problem at all. The service was very friendly and courteous and very knowledgeable. We had Poppadoms; probably the best I’ve had followed by the best Onion Bhaji I’ve had. Our mains were Balti Lamb and Dahi Lamb accompanied by Pilau and Peshwari rice. Beautiful just so tasty. I finished with Gulab Jammam with Pistachio Kulfi. Both made by the owner and his wife had cooked our dishes. We will definitely return. Highly recommended,Date of visit: March 2020,Shaheens Indian,1,"Durham, United Kingdom"
"Friendly, great coffee",A small welcoming cafe in the heart of Richmond. Very welcoming and obliging. Great coffee and breakfast.,Date of visit: January 2020,Sip Coffee,1,"Richmond, United Kingdom"
Excellent,A very testing time for all of the staff as we arrived in a power cut. The lady in charge was very friendly and helpful with Gluten Free options. It was a tough time for all of the staff and the kitchen and I think they dealt with it excellently. Our food was excellent. The Monday Pensioner’s special was very popular. All of the serving staff were helpful and attentive. It’s a very welcome stop for us en route to our holiday on the coast. We’ll definitely return.,Date of visit: January 2020,The Station Grill Restaurant,1,"Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain, United Kingdom"
Good basic tasty food.,"A good no frills cafe serving very reasonably priced food. I had Ham, Egg and Chips and it was very good. Plenty of tea too. Can’t stand places that are mean with tea. It’s a real locals cafe. Parking outside but you have to pay and the warden is often round. If you want free parking then park on the main road.",Date of visit: January 2020,The Teesdale Restaurant,1,"Barnard Castle, United Kingdom"
Understaffed,"My second visit so I’m basing this on both.
The staff are helpful and friendly but always very rushed. Seems they are perpetually understaffed which isn’t great for customer service. My starter of Whitebait was very nice and my Carne Mistra Pizza on a GF base was good. We waited quite a while to get our bill then pay. I suggest the management look at staffing levels. I would’ve ordered a pudding but didn’t want to wait that long.",Date of visit: January 2020,Bella Italia,1,"Darlington, United Kingdom"
Beautiful mountain,A beautiful mountain which I didn’t see in the best of weather or indeed health. I had rather an upset tummy and I fear I must apologise for the rather messy call of nature. I can testify that moss is wonderful as a replacement for loo roll,Date of experience: March 2019,Cader Idris,1,"Dolgellau, United Kingdom"
"Authentic , Friendly, Cosy","A cosy restaurant decorated in a Greek style. Friendly welcome. We shared Dolmades and Roasted Hummus dip: both very tasty. My main of Pork Souvlaki was excellent, served with rice, chips , salad and tzatziki. My wife’s Lamb Kleftiko was served with veg and excellent. We had desserts of Greek Yoghurt and Honey and Torte . All very good.
We often holiday on Kefalonia and the food we had was comparable to the food there, authentic and great tasting. We’ll definitely return.",Date of visit: December 2019,Kaminaki Greek Taverna,1,"Stockton-on-Tees, United Kingdom"
Disappointing,"We explained about dietary requirements but the waiter struggled to understand. It’s very important that serving staff can give accurate advice about allergens in food.
My wife’s Masala Cauliflower was actually sausages, no mention of sausages was made on the menu. It was all very very average.",Date of visit: November 2019,Salvos Cucina Italiana,1,"Darlington, United Kingdom"
Superb Thai foos,An excellent restaurant. We explained we needed some Gluten Free dishes and they were very knowledgeable. Great service. My Chicken Satay starter was the best I’ve ever had. Mains of Chee Chee Prawns and Chicken Pad Thai. All very good. I only have one small gripe and that is no Gluten Free desserts but we raised this with Mantra and I felt they listened.,Date of visit: November 2019,Mantra Thai Dining,1,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"
Disappointing,"No trays. Poor selection. Dirty cutlery, tables and floor. Slow service , much slower than other cafes.",Date of visit: November 2019,Sainsbury's cafe,1,"Bishop Auckland, United Kingdom"
Great restaurant,Super fish and chips and mushy peas. Great gluten free fish n chips too. Lovely friendly staff. Dog friendly too. Cracking fish n chip restaurant near the station.,Date of visit: October 2019,Express Fish and Chips,1,"Aberystwyth, United Kingdom"
"Excellent café , dog friendly, good for Gluten Free","Really imaginative Breakfast, Brunch and Lunches. Great for Vegan, GF, super cakes.
Really friendly and helpful. A lovely ‘feel’ to the cafe. Definitely a must in Aber.",Date of visit: October 2019,Little Devil's Café,1,"Aberystwyth, United Kingdom"
Lovely night’s stay,"Joan is a wonderful lady, very welcoming and kind. She dried our wet clothes and boots. Her evening meal and breakfast were both excellent home cooked food. A really good nights sleep. I beautiful place to stay.",Date of stay: October 2019,Maesyronnen B&B,1,"Ystradfellte, United Kingdom"
Horrendous Service,"I visited The Usk Inn on 26.9.19. My friend had booked and paid for this in June via Booking. Com.
When we arrived the owner was talking to another couple and his son dealt with us. He had to refer to his father with every question. We were asked to pick our breakfast then for the following day. We did so albeit reluctantly . We were then asked to pick a ‘ breakfast slot’ these times ranged in increments of ten minutes from 8am to 8.50am. Again we complied although found it unusual. My friend was asked for his email address, he queried why they needed this, the reply was eventually decided upon, in case we left anything behind. They had my friend’s details from Booking.com.
We were asked if we were dining there and told that the kitchen closed at 7.30pm. This seemed bizarre, incredibly early . We said we’d be down at 7.15.
In all of the conversations , the owner seemed brusque and officious. Not welcoming at all. We passed it off as him having a bad day.
We were shown to our room and advised that his refurb had cost him a fortune.
The room was acceptable. The worktop in the bathroom had been patched up quite poorly . Small things like only one milk carton for tea and coffee.
We went down for our evening meal at 7.15pm. I ordered Chicken Satay and my friend Prawn Cocktail. The Satay was acceptable . My friend’s Prawn Cocktail was poor, very small frozen prawns and a small lettuce salad. The cost was £5.45. My friend sent the Prawn Cocktail back as it was very poor.
The Owner queried it and took it back to the kitchen. We heard very loud voices. The owner came out and immediately said “We won’t serve you any more food”
We queried why.
He replied “The chef ( his wife) didn’t like us returning the Prawns and he’d never had any complaints before “
He was very hostile.
I was genuinely shocked at his aggressive attitude.
He stated that they were miles from the sea and couldn’t get fresh fish . There’s a fish market at Brecon , down the road twice a week and a local pub serves fish specials three times a week. I started to try and explain that I’d worked at a very exclusive household miles from the sea and the fish van visited regularly, he cut me off and said “ I’m not interested in where you worked “
He became more and more agitated.
His wife came through and told her son to demand payment from us for the wine and my Satay before we left the restaurant. I duly paid and tried to explain I was shocked at the level of service. He was uninterested. We said we’d get an evening meal at a local pub.
Unbeknown to us , he phoned The White Hart and told them not to serve “ two ruffians “
Incidentally, I don’t feel I or my friend earnt the epithet ‘ruffian ‘. We are both professional family men in our 50s on a walking break.
We left to go to The White Harte. He then ran out of the pub and accused us of turning his open/closed sign around. I didn’t notice what it said as we left. He was very aggressive and I felt genuinely threatened by him. I apologised if he felt we’d done anything but his aggressive manner wasn’t helping. We walked away.
We had a lovely meal at the White Harte and was told of his phone call. Luckily they didn’t take him seriously.
We returned.
In the morning, he was equally unfriendly but not aggressive but extremely friendly to another couple who were dining too.
I handed his key in and we left.",Date of stay: September 2019,The Usk Guest House,1,"Talybont-on-Usk, United Kingdom"
Superb friendly welcome,"After walking for a day on the Beacons, we were met with a very friendly welcome. A good selection of drinks including several real ales. We had a good chat with the lady behind the bar.
We returned for our meal later after we received shockingly bad service at another local hostelry. We should’ve stayed here.
We had an excellent Scampi and chips. They went out of their way to help us and I can’t thank them enough.",Date of visit: September 2019,The White Hart Inn,1,"Talybont-on-Usk, United Kingdom"
"Great pub, great food","We visited after a refreshing swim in Wastwater. I had a cracking pint of Stout. The bar is great, old booths with thick wooden tables that look like they’ve been there forever.
I had Cumberland Sausage with fresh veg and mash, excellent. My wife had Gammon which was great too.
I heartily recommend this great pub in one of the most beautiful settings you can find.",Date of visit: September 2019,Ritson's Bar and Residents,1,"Wasdale Head, United Kingdom"
"Food ok , poor service","We went in at 11.20 am and noticed the breakfast was being served until 11.30am.
We ordered two No Gluten Breakfasts. The lady serving was very helpful but she asked the extremely unhelpful chef who’d wandered in how long it’d be. We got the impression he didn’t want to cook the two sausages he needed to make the breakfast complete as they had everything else ready. He said it’d be 20 mins. I queried 20 minutes to cook two sausages. He walked off and muttered “ At least 20 minutes, I’ve got lunches to cook”.
My issue is that if you serve breakfast until 11.30 then all staff should be whole heartedly on board with it. Another issue is that staff are friendly when dealing with customers and not hostile.
The food was good and tasty and actually arrived much sooner than he predicted.
The coffee was good and all other staff were professional and courteous.",Date of visit: September 2019,Stockton - Wyvale Garden Centre Restaurant,1,"Stockton-on-Tees, United Kingdom"
Nice decor but much to do,"The Hotel has been refurbished recently and it looks great. We went for a midweek meal. The barman wasn’t the most smiling or welcoming person I’ve ever met. He showed us to our table. We were given the menus but he didn’t mention the specials board, a shame as I would have liked one of the specials. The mains were perfectly acceptable, just good pub grub. My wive’s Eton Mess dessert was very disappointing. It was a sparse offering with a small amount of meringue and fruit on a slate. It looked ridiculous. All in all, it’s ok but there’s much better to be had nearby.",Date of stay: September 2019,The George Hotel,1,"Piercebridge, United Kingdom"
Excellent food and service,"We booked but decided to go earlier. They accommodated us. What struck me is that the service is professional and friendly. It’s rare to see both or indeed either. Lovely decor. My Chicken Satay Starter was excellent as was my wife’s chicken wings in chilli and garlic. Mains of Sweet n Sour chicken with Vermicelli noodles and a house special. All superb. Service is excellent. Highly recommended.
A bonus is that they allow dogs.
Super gluten free menu.",Date of visit: July 2019,Michael Wan's Mandarin Cantonese Restaurant,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
Superb,We stayed this last weekend as we were swimming in the Pier to Pier Swim. Julie and Steve are very friendly and obviously big dog lovers. Everything was thought of. Our room was beautifully clean and comfortable. There’s a lounge where we watched TV with our doggies. The breakfast choice is excellent and they even do a Pet Breakfast. I’d whole heartedly recommend staying at The Chesterfield. We’ll definitely return.,Date of stay: July 2019,The Chesterfield Pet Friendly B&B,1,"Blackpool, United Kingdom"
Beware of wrong charging,I ordered an Small Iced Latte. £2.49. The lady serving try to charge £3.79 which she claimed is the price of a latte( it isn’t) . She then tried to charge me for a larger drink which I hadn’t ordered. She tried to charge me incorrectly twice. So beware of wrong charging.,Date of visit: July 2019,Costa,1,"Leeming Bar, United Kingdom"
Quirky and great food,"We were visiting for the Brass Festival. We’d seen s big queue for this cafe before: a good sign. We queued but not too long. The decor is shabby chic. I like it. I had a superfood salad and a mint tea: very tasty. My wife had a veggie brunch which looked great. Good service and great food.
Definitely return.",Date of visit: July 2019,Flat White Durham Cafe,1,"Durham, United Kingdom"
"Very welcoming, great GF cakes","We popped in with our doggies after walking by the Tees. It was busy but we managed to find a table. We had tea and coffee and a chocolate torte and a pistachio cake. Both cakes were excellent and Gluten Free. The staff were friendly, efficient and helpful. I’d definitely try the Sunday lunch another time.",Date of stay: July 2019,High Force Hotel,1,"Forest-in-Teesdale, United Kingdom"
Brilliant night,We visited last night. What a great night. Really good DJ playing songs we all knew. Good selection of ale and drinks. One of best nights out I’ve had in a long time!,Date of visit: June 2019,The Dragon,1,"Nottingham, United Kingdom"
"Great food and service, GF Provision excellent","I booked online, it was easy and received confirmation quickly. A very busy restaurant on Saturday night in good old Durham town ( although a city now) .
We were shown to our table and after a little rearranging were seated. My only gripe would be that I’d have liked a little more room as I feel that 3 of us squashed onto a table for two. They dealt with our need for Gluten Free food for one of our party excellently and I was reassured that they took it seriously.
We tried a lovely Hardy’s Cabernet Sauvignon, a Lebanese Wine which was excellent. I, as the driver, had a Mango Lassi which was one of the best I’ve had.
For starters we shared Okra, Chicken Wings and Baba Ganoush, served with GF Lebanese flat bread.
Our mains were a mixed grill, Shawrama chicken and another chicken dish plus a salad.
To finish we had Lebanese Coffee and Knefeh: a shredded wheat with pistachios and honey.
The service was excellent and considering they were so busy , we never felt they’d forgotten us. Very impressed!",Date of visit: June 2019,Lebaneat,1,"Durham, United Kingdom"
Very average,"A cafe combined with a shop. The table we sat at was dirty from previous customers and not cleaned.
My coffee was fine and so was my cake. My wife ordered a gluten free cake which the waitress was going to cut with a knife used for other cakes, hence cross contamination. This is extremely poor and would be serious for people allergic to gluten.
Service was average
All in all not impressed.",Date of visit: May 2019,Leaf Bark & Berries,1,"Seaham, United Kingdom"
Superb Gluten Free,"A very busy cafe which we were lucky to get in. The whole menu is GF which is excellent news . My Lebanese Flatbread was tasty as was my wife’s Lebanese Burger. Prompt service.

"Lovely cafe, great farm shop",A lovely building. A cracking farm shop and a lovely cafe. I had a BLT and Mrs Gardener an Omlette. Both were excellent. Good service and friendly and helpful. Bought some wonderful cheeses and bread.,Date of visit: May 2019,Loch Arthur,1,"Dumfries, United Kingdom"
"Excellent food, excellent service",We visited as we are on holiday in the area. The booking was easy . The waiter was very good: attentive but not intrusive. I had excellent crab cakes and Haddock Thermidor crepe. My wife’s Hake was superb too. Highly recommended restaurant.We’ll definitely visit again and again.,Date of visit: May 2019,Auld Alliance Restaurant,1,"Kirkcudbright, United Kingdom"
Very Good,"I booked online which I don’t normally do but it all went well. The service was very good , attentive and not over bearing.
We had Aubergine and Falafel starters : both gorgeous and I normally hate aubergines. I had Lamb from the grill and my wife chicken. Both were great.
Finished with Turkish Coffee.
A very pleasurable evening.",Date of visit: May 2019,Akarsu Turkish Restaurant & Grill,1,"Durham, United Kingdom"
Great food and friendly service,We stayed in one of the Pods and so had breakfast and dinner here. We weren’t disappointed by any meal we had. Great quality food and good service. Wished it was this good when I did the Coast to Coast.,Date of visit: November 2018,Lordstones Cafe,1,"Chop Gate, United Kingdom"
Cracking proper English cafe,A truly great English cafe. Dog friendly and good for gluten free dishes. Often a queue as it’s popular. I had Corned Beef Pie with veg and chips. My wife had Vegan Curry . Both were excellent. Highly recommended.,Date of visit: November 2018,Signals,1,"Saltburn-by-the-Sea, United Kingdom"
Excellent service,"We had coffee , hot chocolate and GF cake outside. The young man who brought our drinks is a real credit to Surfs Up, he was really friendly and caring. I noticed how he served others and he’s a real gem. A rarity. Super location for dog walkers and beach lovers.",Date of visit: November 2018,Surf's Up,1,"Saltburn-by-the-Sea, United Kingdom"

"Great food, very GF friendly, very dog friendly","What a lovely setting, right on the broads. We sat outside with our dogs. They have a really good Gluten Free menu. My wife loved her chicken burger. My Crab salad was very tasty. Really good cafe.",Date of visit: October 2018,The Waterside,1,"Rollesby, United Kingdom"
Pretty basic stuff,"Usual fare for a cafe, Panini, Sarnis, Jackets, Cakerage, that sort of caper.
Service ok, not particularly smily or friendly. This cafe is nothing to get excited about.",Date of visit: October 2018,Lily's Tearoom,1,"North Walsham, United Kingdom"
Gorgeous coffee,We had coffee and I had a Cinnamon Bun. The staff were really lovely and friendly and even gave biccies to our 3 doggies. Handy for the bus station too.,Date of visit: October 2018,Cafe Dane,1,"Cromer, United Kingdom"
Superb Fish n Chips,"The service is prompt and friendly. My Cod and Chips was very fresh with the best Tartare sauce I’ve ever tasted. Gorgeous mushy peas. All in all, very good and highly recommended.",Date of visit: October 2018,No1 Cromer & Ice Cromer,1,"Cromer, United Kingdom"
"Great place, really busy","A small cafe virtually on the beach. It was busy but service is excellent and fast, very well organised. I had a very tasty bowl of soup and my wife Gluten Free Cake. Both excellent. There’s a good choice . Recommended",Date of visit: September 2018,Dunes Cafe,1,"Winterton-on-Sea, United Kingdom"
Standards are slipping,"My last few visits have sadly led me to the conclusion that standards are slipping at a once good nursery. There was wind blown stock all over. Many old tired looking plants. Basic maintenance had been neglected such as weeding and keeping paths clean. Larch Cottage has always been expensive but to charge £35 for a Buxus cone with Red Spider mite is treating customers with contempt. Volutella or possibly Box blight on other Buxus. All in all , shoddy. On a plus side, the cafe is nice.",Date of experience: September 2018,Larch Cottage Nurseries,1,"Penrith, United Kingdom"
Generally good Greek Taverna.,"The situation is superb with great views out to see. The food is good. Service can be a bit haphazard as the kitchen is next door and they communicate wirelessly to it. Overall it's ok, there are better and there are worse.",Date of visit: May 2018,Lourdas Mare,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Food very good, service poor","We were recommended this restaurant as being the best for fish in Argostoli. It was recommended by a local. It commands a great position by the De Bosset Bridge. We sat down and were served by a young man. He couldn’t explain the menu very well. When the food came it was fine, very nice and tasty. The problem was that the two waiters were far more interested in chatting amongst themselves than serving paying customers. We would have had desserts and coffee if we could have caught his attention. We went inside and the owner was very friendly, however his waiting staff need a kick up the backside.",Date of visit: May 2018,Aristofanis Restaurant,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Extremely long wait.,"We ordered a juice , milkshake and some cheesy chips. The drinks were great but the cheesy chips took 45 minutes to arrive. In anybody’s book this is farcical.",Date of visit: May 2018,Marabou Cafe,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great traditional Taverna,"You can’t get more authentic! You go inside to choose from the dishes. These change daily. The really friendly, happy and helpful staff will help you make your choice. I had Perch with Gigantes: gorgeous. Thoroughly recommend",Date of visit: May 2018,Taverna Patsouras,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Excellent.,"We loved everything about Christinas. We were welcomed by Christina who is really friendly. Our room was beautiful, it looked straight out onto the sea. There was a lift to take our cases upstairs which Christina helped us with. During our stay Christina’s husband Makis was warm and friendly and just a lovely man. Rebecca who helps Makis and Christina is really friendly and such a warm smile. The position of the studios is excellent with some steps down to the beach . It’s just over the very quiet road. The studio is at the quieter end of Lourdas and a short walk from good Tavernas. I’d thoroughly recommend a stat here. We’ve stayed in a number of places on Kefalonia and this is our favourite.",Date of stay: May 2018,Christina Studios,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Brilliant day,"We were really looking forward to this and it didn’t disappoint. Michalis and Antonia and crew were really friendly. They hauled in the nets and we marvelled at the catch as it came in. Later they cooked the catch, wow! Eating the freshest possible seafood. Lobster, Scorpion Fish, Octopus, Squid, Spider Crab, Red Mullet, Wrasse, Sea Bream and Sea Bass were all landed. We swam in beautiful clear water. It’s an excellent day out and if you do one thing on Kefalonia then do this.",Date of experience: May 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great food and friendly service,We visited on a wet evening. Our starters of gigantes and Potato salad were excellent. My main of Lamb Kleftiko was probably one of the best I’ve had. Very reasonable pricing. Authentic Greek food.,Date of visit: May 2018,Dionysos Taverna,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Unfriendly,The rather miserably and grumpy person behind the counter grunted at me. I ordered a coffee to go. I selected a sausage roll which I thought would be nice if it were warmed. Old grumpy guts didn’t offer to warm it. The coffee was average and the lid kept coming off. I can’t recommend it here unless you have a liking for grumpy gnomes.,Date of visit: March 2018,Jeffersons of Richmond,1,"Richmond, United Kingdom"
Quick bite before the film. Very good,"We waited a little while and then showed to our table. The staff are courteous and helpful. They were particularly helpful with one of our party who is gluten free.They had run out of quinoa due to the bad weather, a real disaster for a middle class diner. I nevertheless weathered the storm and received extra seeds on my salad. The Peri Peri chicken was jolly tasty as was my beverage which I think was mango. The staff checked if we were happy with our meal. Indeed we were and I'd return. Pleasantly suprised.",Date of visit: March 2018,Nando's Darlington,1,"Darlington, United Kingdom"
Great atmosphere in a cellar,We really enjoyed our meals at Magnus Ladulas. We ate in what is probably an old wine cellar. It's atmospheric . The prices were standard for Stockholm which tend to be more expensive but then the food is very different and always excellent.,Date of visit: February 2018,Magnus Ladulas,1,"Stockholm, Sweden"
"Superb , amazing",As soon as you walk in to the museum you can't help saying 'Wow'. The sheer size of Vasa and it's elegance is stunning. We went on the excellent guided tour and watched a film about Vasa. Both of these were in English. The cafe is super too with great views over the harbour. The gift shop is expensive,Date of experience: February 2018,Vasa Museum,1,"Stockholm, Sweden"
Lovely hotel in a great location,"The hotel is really handy for the centre and for boats to Vaxholm and the islands.
The reception staff were all friendly and helpful without fail.
The breakfast...wow, superb, such choice.
Our room was warm and comfortable. My one slight gripe is no tea and coffee making facilities in the room but we concluded maybe it's not offered in Sweden.
I'd definitely stay again.",Date of stay: February 2018,First Hotel Reisen,1,"Stockholm, Sweden"
Stunning,"Everything was perfect from the warm welcome to my final glass of Diplomatico Reserva. I started with venison heart with salsify crisp, pickled yellow beetroot and horseradish followed by steamed cod with shrimps mmmmmm. I had the milk chocolate sandwich with cloudberries for dessert. My wife’s meal was equally excellent and a stunning warm rose hip soup for dessert. Wow! Our waitress was just lovely. I can’t recommend this highly enough. We’ll definitely return.",Date of visit: February 2018,Tradition,1,"Stockholm, Sweden"
Rip off,"I used to visit the establishment regularly as a feckless younger man. The kebabs had magical qualities, they absorbed alcohol. The rather pungent side effects seemed worth it.
However, in my knowledge of the magical qualities of their kebabs I visited, only to be disappointed. I ordered kebab meat and chips priced at £4.50. However the rather surly man asked for £5. I queried the discrepancy. He claimed 50p for sauces. I paid the extra grudgingly but I cannot recommend Speedy Pepper. I feel there was sharp practice afoot. The kebab meat was ok but not as succulent as it used to be. Amazingly the magical qualities of the meat are still there. I had no hangover and I had been quaffing numerous ales.",Date of visit: December 2017,Speedy Pepper,1,"Darlington, United Kingdom"
"Very tasty food, good service","A group of four friends went. We all enjoyed our obligatory poppadoms. We shard some starters which were tasty if a little small. My Railway Lamb main was excellent. The service was very good, attentive but not overly. I'd recommend Duke Bombay for every occassion.",Date of visit: December 2017,Duke Bombay Cafe,1,"Darlington, United Kingdom"
Slow,"I’ve been quite a few times before and I usually rate the service as good. However the service for our meal was extremely slow . We waited over an hour for our mains to arrive. This is unacceptable. One waitress eventually apologised after we’d chased up where our food was. I don’t blame the waitresses who were helpful and efficient. The problem seemed to be an understaffed kitchen in an overbooked venue. I would try it again but if there was s repeat I wouldn’t return. On a plus note , the food was excellent.",Date of visit: November 2017,Voodoo Cafe,1,"Darlington, United Kingdom"
Lovely cafe,My first visit to Vennels. Great to see Gluten Free provision. My wife liked her Baked Potato and my Cheese and Onion Quiche was excellent. It was very busy with a queue to be served. I have one small gripe and that’s a huge draught whenever someone opened the door. Overall Very good.,Date of visit: November 2017,Vennel's Cafe,1,"Durham, United Kingdom"
"First visit, impressed","We’d not been because I was put off by the exterior which I don’t think looks nice. However, a friend suggested it. Parking is limited near the pub but lots available locally. We received a warm friendly welcome. My beer was very good as was my wine. All of our meals were excellent. The service was very good too. A young lady served us, you are a credit to the Fox Hole. Overall I was impressed and will definitely return.",Date of visit: November 2017,The Fox Hole,1,"Darlington, United Kingdom"
"Great food, excellent service",Everything was excellent. The service from the young waitress and the menu were both great. The food is super and cater well for Gluten Free diners. Recommended,Date of visit: October 2017,Valentine's Restaurant,1,"Barnard Castle, United Kingdom"
Average Indian Restaurant,"The restaurant looks pretty grim from the outside but don't let that put you off. It's ok. It's clean and the staff are helpful. We had poppadoms which were good. Our mains came in a strange contraption which looked like a battle bus but turned out to be a heated trolley. That's a first for me. The food was tasty, nothing special but perfectly acceptable. It's average and fairly priced. Although Castle Douglas is heralded as a food town, i think they haven't told Castle Douglas, it does seem to have an inordinate amount of Butchers though. Hilary Briss?",Date of visit: September 2017,Jewel in the Crown,1,"Castle Douglas, United Kingdom"
"Dining Very Good, Bar not so good","A visit of two halves, a bit like the glorious game.
First of all the good news. The restaurant staff and in particular the chef were very helpful in helping us select Gluten Free dishes from the menu. Top marks. My wife's Goats cheese was very good as were my Fishcakes. I was especially impressed by the chef who came to see my wife , he/she must've been busy and yet they made time to talk about gluten free options. Well done.
Now the bad news; The bar staff. The young fella serving me struggled to remember my order because he wasn't listening. Remembering two drinks isn't hard and something that most bar staff can manage. When my orange juice and lemonade was served , I had to stir it because he obviously couldn't be bothered. One of our party remarked that the bar staff treated customers as if they interrupted their conversation and a necessary evil, Overall it's average because the restaurant is excellent and the bar terrible.",Date of visit: October 2017,Abbey Wharf,1,"Whitby, United Kingdom"
Excellent,We booked for a special meal with friends. They catered excellently for one of our party who is Gluten Free. I had the Swordfish then Eton Mess: both were excellent. All of our group were very impressed. We'd definitely return.,Date of visit: October 2017,Wayfarer Bistro,1,"Robin Hoods Bay, United Kingdom"
"Odd, terrible food, cheap","We visited the Jade Palace after reviewing Trip. There were many good and excellent reviews, I have to wonder, where do these people normally eat that their standards are so low?
We asked which dishes could be Gluten Free. The waitress gave the most garbled explanation and finally said ""Just Egg Foo Yong, Omlettes and vegetables ""
This is odd as we regularly visit a Chinese restaurant and they have told us that Chinese chefs more often than not use potato starch or cornflour to thicken sauces. We considered leaving then but thought we'd try and see if there were any dishes GF. The waitress returned after having discussed us at length with presumably the chef. I asked what they used to thicken sauces, she ignored that question and seemed to think it was Soy Sauce that was the problem (Coeliacs are often ok with Soy Sauce but not always) . She finally conceded that Chopsuey is GF ( I don't know why she didn't mention it before). My wife ordered a Chicken and Mushroom soup which she said was tasty but to be honest, it looked like dishwater with a few lumps of boiled chicken thrown in. I wasn't as lucky, my Satay Skewer is probably the most unpleasant starter I've ever been proffered. Deep fried , unidentifiable meat is dubious origin. O well, the main of Mongolian Chicken would surely be an improvement. You can guess it wasn't. It must be hard to make a dish so sour and sweet . It really was pretty bad.
It was £25 for two courses . I'd prefer to pay more and receive edible food.
The ambiance is not improved by peeling wallpaper on a damp wall and a constant stream of people for 'carry-outs' .

Average Indian Restaurant,"The restaurant looks pretty grim from the outside but don't let that put you off. It's ok. It's clean and the staff are helpful. We had poppadoms which were good. Our mains came in a strange contraption which looked like a battle bus but turned out to be a heated trolley. That's a first for me. The food was tasty, nothing special but perfectly acceptable. It's average and fairly priced. Although Castle Douglas is heralded as a food town, i think they haven't told Castle Douglas, it does seem to have an inordinate amount of Butchers though.

"Dining Very Good, Bar not so good","A visit of two halves, a bit like the glorious game.
First of all the good news. The restaurant staff and in particular the chef were very helpful in helping us select Gluten Free dishes from the menu. Top marks. My wife's Goats cheese was very good as were my Fishcakes. I was especially impressed by the chef who came to see my wife , he/she must've been busy and yet they made time to talk about gluten free options. Well done.
Now the bad news; The bar staff. The young fella serving me struggled to remember my order because he wasn't listening. Remembering two drinks isn't hard and something that most bar staff can manage. When my orange juice and lemonade was served , I had to stir it because he obviously couldn't be bothered. One of our party remarked that the bar staff treated customers as if they interrupted their conversation and a necessary evil, Overall it's average because the restaurant is excellent and the bar terrible.",Date of visit: October 2017,Abbey Wharf,1,"Whitby, United Kingdom"

My wife's steak was cooked exactly how she asked. Our pudding of Eton Mess was gorgeous and the ice cream with it was one of the nicest I've ever had.

Of the two lifts one didn't work and the one that did was dirty, ice cream tub left and contents spattered inside. Our room was basic . The toilet didn't flush properly.

They did struggle a bit with the whole gluten free idea as my wife's brownie was not served with ice cream ;which is usually GF. Overall it was good but could do with a little more atmosphere. Hope they make a go of it.",Date of visit: May 2015,Salvos Cucina Italiana,1,"Darlington, United Kingdom"

Very impressed,We went last night on Valentines night. It was very busy and rightly so. Superb food and service as ever. The service was especially impressive as the restaurant was full of couples.

I really recommend The Riverside. One of the best I've stayed at.",Date of stay: January 2015,Riverside Bed and Breakfast,1,"Bainbridge, United Kingdom"
Lovely Hotel but can be a bit noisy,"We stayed for two nights. Lovely welcome, friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and well appointed, minor gripe but the SMART TV wasn't tuned properly so the tv guide didn't work. We ate at Ciro's their own restaurant; this was excellent. Serving staff and food wasn't second to none. On return to our room we could hear other guest clearly in the corridor and in the morning workmen outside. The room really didn't seem very well sound-proofed.
On our second night we ordered room service, well I tried. No answer from Room Service so I rang reception who organised it. The food was fine.
The spa facilities are excellent with a lovely pool, jacuzzi and sauna.",Date of stay: January 2015,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,1,"Pulford, United Kingdom"
Excellent Fish n chips,"Visited as part of a works do. The cask ale is kept very well indeed. It's a lovely cosy country pub. Friendly bar staff.

Unhappy Barman,"We went for a drink, would've had a meal if they were serving. The barman is probably the most miserable one I've ever had the misfortune of being served by. It wasn't busy at all and it felt like we'd inconvenienced his quiet nap. The beer was very good and menu looked nice. Don't expect any jollity from the barman, you may be lucky and get his day off.",,The Old Well Inn,1,"Barnard Castle, United Kingdom"

Miserable slow service,It took ages for them to acknowledge us. We very nearly went elsewhere then the waiter arrived. Unsmiling service and not the usual friendliness with have come to expect with Kefalonia . The fish was good but the veg with it was miserly. I cannot recommend this restaurant .,,Restaurant Tassia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Food tasty , service ok. All a bit ok","Visited with friends . Poppadums come with the smallest servings of pickle, which you pay for ! We asked for more pickle but it arrived after we'd finished our poppadoms and mains had arrived. The food is served in pans, the sort you'd boil an egg in, bit weird and gives you less table room. Food was tasty though but not as good as Amritsar but rivalling Cafe Spice. Service is better in Cafe Spice. Waiters are young and inexperienced. No-one asked if the meal was ok.I'd go again but prefer other restaurants.",Date of visit: July 2014,Duke Bombay Cafe,1,"Darlington, United Kingdom"
Good service and food,"Really enjoyed the whole ambience. Service is polite and prompt. Food very good and good value too.I had Seafood Paella, very tasty.

Dirty and in need of renovation,"Stayed at the Farmhouse which is half a mile from the pub. This isn't made obvious when we booked. The road has no verges. The Farmhouse itself is in need of a big refurb. Windows need painting, tied old soda. No milk for tea and coffee. Dirty velux and a bat flying around...I kid you not. Walked to pub. Service is a bit rushed and unfriendly, then a long wait. There's Wifi but oddly you can't use it as ' it will interfere with the card payment system' . The food and beer were very good. Overall , service is chaotic and it feels like Fawlty Towers.",,Cwellyn Arms,1,"Rhyd Ddu, United Kingdom"
Lovely Hotel,Peter welcomed my mate and myself on the night of Germany v Brazil. He's a real Gentleman and nice chap. Everywhere is very clean.

Incorrect Information NOT Dog Friendly,"This is listed on many sites are dog friendly, it isn't. I have been in contact and asked them to alter this on the various sites.

"Lovely Hotel, Breakfast chaotic","Stayed very recently. The welcome was friendly . Our room clean and comfortable , although the mattress was a little soft to our taste. We dined out but had breakfast . It seemed very poorly organised and some people were forgotten. The food was excellent and special diet well catered for . A very annoying man carrying out his mobile phone call loudly was not dealt with.
In summary; it's a great position and our room was fine. Breakfast maybe best taken out as there's lots of choice locally. Try Veronica's patisserie.",Date of stay: March 2014,The Midland,1,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Excellent food,"We ordered our drinks and the order was mislaid so no drinks for 1/2 hour. They apologised and from then on no problems. The food was excellent ; peri peri chicken and xinxim.

"Food ok , horrendous toilet","Dined recently after a recommendation by a friend. The service was ok and food fine, nothing special just basic Curry House.After our meal,I went to the toilet and found a sinl full of vomit.
I informed the waiter who discussed it with another waiter. I received no apology or reduction on my bill. He said a previous customer had eaten a vindaloo and couldn't handle it! I am not making this up. Needless to say I'll never return.",Date of visit: February 2014,Asha Tandoori,1,"Catterick, United Kingdom"

Tries but doesn't acheive,"Went for the New Year Dinner Dance. Room was ok but no great effort to spruce it up. Food ok but portions a little on miserly size. DJ was useless , using the occasion to also broadcast his Radio station and play music no one liked or danced to. Two hand pulls one ok the other was off Ale , tasted if vinegar. Overall poor standard.",Date of stay: December 2013,Best Western Plus The Croft Hotel,1,"Croft-on-Tees, United Kingdom"

"Soulless , warm cider , chewy poppadoms.","Our welcome by a rather scruffy lady didn't bode well .Poppadoms served in a flash ; they were chewy ,probably due them being on a hot plate for ages. My cider (they had one can!) was warm. We were the only ppl in and I can see why.The mains were tasty though both dishes and the rice. It's a shame as this used to be a good restaurant .",Date of visit: July 2013,Spice Garden,1,"Darlington, United Kingdom"
