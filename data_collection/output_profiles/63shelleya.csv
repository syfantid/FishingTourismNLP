Chocolate pie!,Okay our dinner was amazing and enjoyed the service. We didn't have reservations and they still made room for us. But the dessert of chocolate pie was delicious with our Greek coffee. Nice way to end a busy day!,Date of visit: September 2018,Enalion,1,"Milos, Greece"
Greek hospitality and fishing makes great memories,"We can't say enough about this trip, as soon as we walked onto the boat we were family! Captain Nikos and his wife Frossa welcomed us serving coffee while we waited for others to arrive. Nikos knowing that we wanted to fish allowed us to fish with rods and the other couples joined in with their first time rod fishing. Very exciting for every one. We had carpaccio with my fish before we were served an amazing lunch from the fish caught in the nets. Several stops to go swimming and just relax and enjoy the day. We were feed all day with delicious foods that Frossa created from her galley. It was definitely a great way to end our trip here in Milos.",Date of experience: September 2018,Milos Fishing Experience,1,"Milos, Greece"
Disappointment with Cancellation Policy,"We planned our first trip to the maritime provinces, mapped out our route to cover Nova Scotia, PEI and New Brunswick and had booked all our rooms in advance. We soon discovered after our first day of travelling that the time frame that we gave ourselves and the coastal routes that we were taking was not allowing us to stop and see any sights or attractions. We decided after our first night that we just couldn't take in all that we planned and had to change our plans. We called Cleveland Place with more than 48 hours notice letting them know that we just couldn't make it to their property. Sadly we were told that we had to give them 15 days notice which is not stated anywhere on their website (yes I checked once again and still nothing about cancellation policy). If the room was not sold that they would charge us, I checked today and sure enough my credit card was charged. I am very disappointed that during this time of year that they would even consider this. We have been having such a wonderful time with people that we have been meeting along our journey, but this treatment has us reconsidering if our next trip will even include New Brunswick. As this was our first time staying in B&B's, this was a costly learning curve that we believe was not necessary!",Date of stay: May 2014,Cleveland Place Bed & Breakfast,1,"Alma, Canada"
