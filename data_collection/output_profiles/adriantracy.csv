A truly amazing day,"A trip for everybody, from lazing, relaxing, soaking up the sunshine type of day, to becoming involved in the daily catch if you wish.

We started the day by having a light breakfast of coffee and home made marmalade/biscuits, before taking a leisurely trip out to the nets, here you can just relax and take in the amazing sea views or watch the daily catch come on board.

We then took off to view the beautiful Kefalonia scenery before stopping off at secluded beaches that can only be reached by boat. Whilst you cool off in the most beautiful blue sea Efi and Dimitrios prepare a banquet fit for royalty, with produce fresh from the sea, collected from Katelios or from their personal garden or neighbouring islands. Watch out for the wine its a bit delicious, home made by the beautiful couple.

There is then time for a swim after lunch or a little line fishing before setting off back to Katelios.

The boat is spotlessly clean, it also has excellent toilet facilities. For those of you considering a boat trip, this really is one for all the family. There is never more than 10 people on board and they also do private trips.

This is the second time we have been on this trip and are already looking forward to our next. A big thank you to Efi and Dimitrios the nicest and best hosts you are likely to meet.

An amazing day,"Even if you are not keen on fishing, this trip is totally amazing. Seeing the team at work, followed by swim stops in the beautiful, clear, blue water. Lunch consisted of the freshly caught fish ""amazing opportunity for novist fish eaters to try something new"" all the vegetables are home grown, which great pride is taken when offering traditional Greek recipes. The hosts are so welcoming and friendly you can not help but feel apart of their widen family. Thank you for a fantastic experience and a trip we shall repeat next year. Trip ideal for families with children as well as couples and groups.",Date of experience: July 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
fantastic and relaxing,"this was our second time at the Royal Decameron and it was as nice as last year, our holiday felt more like three weeks rather than two as it was so so relaxing.

The food was just a little dissapointing this year, but we could always find something.
As for the building works yes some was going on but thinking about it when are they ment to do it when the resort is open 52 weeks a year, can not say it really bothered us.

Trips are a little expensive but you do not have to use your tour operators, all tour operators are expensive around the world where ever you travel.

The only thing that I was dissapointed in on our holiday was the Virgin flight out of GB.
WE WILL RETURN ONE DAY.
Big hello to FRISKY, CHRIS GARFIELD AND SPICE. you need to lose some of your energy..........

Out of all our holidays this is one place I can travel to without getting any upset stomach.",Date of stay: June 2009,Royal Decameron Club Caribbean,4,Jamaica
