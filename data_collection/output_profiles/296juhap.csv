Good food,"We ate here two times on our holiday.
Food was quite good, except local shrimps weren't very tasty. Starter ""Apochti"" was excellent!
Service was very friendly, but a bit slow sometimes.
But great food and a reasonable pricing.",Date of visit: July 2017,Caldera Taverna-Bar,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Overrated,"Hotel is very big and facilities are good.
Pools and the beach are very nice.
Plenty of activities, billiards, air-hockey, good gym etc.
All-inclusive food was below average. Quite tasteless food, at this price I expect better quality. Desserts were some weird cakes and jellyes in a cup. Wtf?!
Beach bar food was a little better.
Room was clean, but a bit worn out. We had a duplett-room. A/C dripped water on a table so much that even the floor was floodin around the table.
Bathroom was ok, but when showering the whole bathroom floor was a big pool because the drain was so slow.
Shower handle was also broken and water temperature varied from hot to cold in seconds.
Laundry service was a rip off!
Staff ok, but not as good as you hoped for from a hotel at this price.
Also hotel was invaded by russians. 95% of guests were from russia.
Overall a good hotel but over priced.",Date of stay: July 2017,Amilia Mare,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Excellent food,"Great pizzas! Nice atmosphere and very friendly service.
Pricing was ok.
Located a bit off from the main street of Kallithea.",Date of visit: July 2017,Antonio Pizza Pasta,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Superb!,"Absolutely great. Also for children, 9 and 11 yrs. Great food and fun fishing.
Went by morning so it was not as hot as afternoon.",Date of experience: July 2017,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Almost perfect,"Very clean hotel, helpful staff, good rooms.
AC in the rooms works only when key in place, and also power sockets so you can't charge phone/pad when away.
Pools great, pool bar good. Beer sometimes just foam, soft drinks ran out few times. Food in restaurant was good and variable. But often quite tasteless and lo-salty.
Children's program in amfitheatre was quite good but the illuminati light show and other late night shows were mind blowing, neverever have ears hurt so much. Singing was so poor i didn't know should i cry or what...",Date of stay: July 2016,Kerkyra Golf,4,"Corfu, Greece"
Good food,"Food was good but not excellent, dishes were big. Drinks were quite expensive but food medium priced. No children's menu.
Fish (dorada) was freshly grilled but with no salt or flavour. Athmosphere really nice, greek. Service was good.
Maybe not worth a second visit, but for a nice bite in the evening just fine.",Date of visit: July 2016,Pergola Restaurant Taverna,4,"Corfu, Greece"
