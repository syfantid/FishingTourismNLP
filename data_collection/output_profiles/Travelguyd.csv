Wonderful food,"This is a great find. Unbelievable value for money, and good service. The tables are right next to the sea, with beautiful views for sunset. Can’t wait to go back.",Date of visit: August 2019,Steki Grill,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great Pub in the river,"This is possibly friendliest pub we’ve ever been too. They’re great with children, fab menu with locally sourced products. The sausages are to die for! We moored up over night and were treated to a electricity and an amazing sunrise. We can’t wait to go back.",Date of visit: October 2018,The Swan on the River Pub & Dining,1,"Littleport, United Kingdom"
Best day out ever!,"This was a the second time we’ve been on this trip in so many years. Efi and Demitri are wonderful hosts, nothing is too much trouble for them. They do all the hard work and you get all the glory and, if fishing’s not your thing you can just watch. They know the best secluded bays to take you to for a swim, at one of the beaches Demitri has even cleared a path of stones from the sea to the shore so its easier to get walk on to the beaches and try out the natural clay pools for a great mud pack!

Whilst we’re chilling in the sea and on the sand Efi creates the best lunch ever. All the salad and veg are home grown from their garden as is the wine, you eat what you catch, so the fish really can’t be any fresher. It really is a feast!

My son and I love our days out with them so much, we’re going out again next week before we go home.",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Appalling experience,"Avoid this hotel - unless you like sleeping in a nightclub and listening to your neighbour's nocturnal activities.
We had to ask five times for our son's cot to be made up. The design of the bathroom means you have no privacy if someone comes through the room door whilst you're in the shower.
You can hear conversations between walls and even floors. You get a very graphic audio experience if you neighbours are playing sweet music, not nice at all.
On the weekend they play music to nightclub levels until 1am in the bar. There had been a party in the function room below our room and the music was blaring out so loud that the floor of our room shook, there was no way anyone could sleep, especially not my 7 and 10-year-old. They continued to play the music even though the party had finished and it took an hour of persistent complaining to get them to turn the music off. I was told that the duty manager couldn't see me because she was too busy, after pressing my point I discovered she was too busy dealing with customer complaints. I witnessed multiple guests complaining about the noise, the staff just didn't give a damn. The staff members are woefully undertrained in customer service, I wouldn't stay here again even though they comped 55% of our stay as an apology. I want to sleep when I stay in a hotel, that's the primary function of the business. Maybe the management should try staying in their hotel at a weekend to get the full customer experience, or lack of.",Date of stay: October 2016,The Time Nyack,1,"Nyack, New York"
Great food off of the main strip,We had the best meal here during our visit to Venice. The only one I'd actually make a bee-line for when we could be back next time. Service and food were faultless.,Date of visit: August 2016,Trattoria Rialto Novo,1,"Venice, Italy"
Disgusting filthy,"We booked this hotel based on the photos on Booking.com - in reality the hotel is absolutely filthy, check the photos. The common parts are even more filthy. We arrived in the early evening and were promised it would be cleaned by the reception staff. We went out for dinner and came back to find the room untouched. The cleaners are supposed to be coming in the morning, but we can't stay another minute. Neither my wife nor I have slept, our pillows stink of body odour and sweat. To be frank the room needs a deep clean and redecorating.

Having just had an excellent stay at another Appart'City in Reims I'm struggling to see how this hotel can be owned by the same brand.

Avoid this one of their hotels like the plague.",Date of stay: July 2016,Appart'City Thonon-les-Bains,1,"Thonon-les-Bains, France"
Medium to poor,"Went with high hopes and to be honest, left quite disillusioned. For a steak restaurant I'd hope for better. I've been to one of their sister restaurants and have always had a great experience, so we booked with that in mind. If the shoe was in the other foot we wouldn't go twice. Maybe it was a bad night, but my gut feeling is that they know their cuts of meat, but don't have the best supply of meat.",,The Cambridge Chop House,1,"Cambridge, United Kingdom"
"Great Beer, Great Food, Great Pub","A lovely village pub with a log fire, comfy chairs, fantastic ales and apparently the wine is good too. But its pièce de résistance is it also serve Indonesian food. What I love is that it's retained the feel of a pub which give the restaurant a relaxed homely atmosphere. The service is great - attentive but not intrusive. We will definitely be back!!",Date of visit: December 2014,Crown & Cushion,1,"Sandy, United Kingdom"
"Great Hotel, wonderful staff, fantastic stay.","We've just returned from a week at the Louis King Jason. I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough. I visited with my wife and two young kids, who said that this was our best family holiday so far. Considering it rained almost everyday, and the shorts stayed in the suitcase for the whole week, that says a lot. The indoor pool was a life saver, and properly heated. The apartment was cleaned daily, even on New Year's Day, the grounds we spotlessly clean too. The staff couldn't have been more helpful or friendly, nothing was a problem. This truly is a hotel where the staff care, and we've stayed in a lot of hotels.

The hotel is a little bit away from the main drag, which to us is a positive. Our four year old daughter had no problem walking to the seafront.

We will definitely be going back, can't wait.",Date of stay: December 2013,The King Jason Paphos - Designed for Adults,1,"Paphos, Cyprus"
A Turkish Delight,"This is a great find, we received a very warm welcome. The food was wonderful, amazing fresh flavours, and so accommodating that would make a meat dish into a vegetarian dish especially for us. This wasn't necessary as there was so much lovely food suitable for veggies.

The home made mezze was to die for, along with the mains and deserts.

When we next go to Cheltenham we'll be sure to go back. Thanks Daphne's for a great evening.",Date of visit: October 2013,Daphne Restaurant,1,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom"
