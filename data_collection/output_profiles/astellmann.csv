A wonderful boat trip day. I recommend.,"It was an incredible day with my family in the Greek blue waters. We went out to fish, enjoy, swim and eat. It was a cozy day, the owners Cristina and her husband are very friendly and they work hard to make to you a wonderful day. We start the day visiting some nice hidden places in the cost, like the cave in the pictures, to after that start to collect the fishing net with what would be our delicious and health fresh fish for lunch. After this we went to Fteri and other beachs around and during our time in the water and beach, the captain and Cristina started to prepare our meal, as you can see in the pictures too. When we return to the boat we found a delightful table with grilled fresh fishes, lobsters, fresh salad, of course with Kefalonias olive oil, bread and local white wine. I not able to find enought words to describe how nice was the boat trip. My son (10 years old) loved everything. Christina and her Husband are starting this business and I will recommend this to everyone I know. If you want to enjoy a quite nice and simple boat trip with good food and without all this fancy things, laud music, lot of people around you, this is the right boat trip to go.
