BEST FISHING TRIP EVER!!!!!!!!!,"I've been experienced this amazing fishing trip the 12/08/2019 and to be honest there are no words to proper describe such an amazing experience....Andonia ,Michalis and the staff member working with them are fabulous, professional , kind, peoples with big heart!!!!I Travelled all Greece during this holiday and definitely this was the best think i could do....Andonia make a lovely breakfast before to start the tour...About the lunch she cooked the Lobster just caught with pasta and other specialities....tomatoes, veggies and wine home made...(i did like the wine a lot , Andonia knows it..;).... all this while we were having a lovely bath in a water clear as a crystal.... I gave 5 star rating but i would easily give 10....Next year i,ll be there 100%....It's not just a fishing trip, it,s like to be part of a family, so i can say that i,ve got my greek family now...I'll see you soon....
LOVE YOU ALL
