Fabulous Fabio!,"We had a great tour with Fabio. We did tour #2 Etna and Taormina. Fabio is an excellent guide. He is very knowledgeable and gave us interesting information as we traveled and answered our many questions. Fabio also managed to fit in Castelmola (our request) which made for a tight timeline to get back to our cruise ship. He adapted the tour as we had our 15 month grandson and a family member with limited mobility in our party of 6.We enjoyed the stop where we could sample and purchase the honey/ olive oil/wine. Our email questions were answered promptly and Mario was there to greet us when we got off the ship.We were very glad to have the fresh tomato/ cheese sandwich and water supplied by the tour. A stop for a restaurant lunch would have taken too much time from the tour. Also guests who take the tours in Sicily should follow the suggested timelines at stops. There is so much to see, that it could shorten your tour if you have a timeline to be back at the cruise ship. Highly recommend Sicily with Mario and thank you Fabio for the memorable tour.",Date of experience: June 2019,Sicily With Mario,5,"Sicily, Italy"
Our Favourite Excursion!,"Our family of 6, age 15 months to 74 years had a wonderful day! Antonia, Michalis, and Hassan are such warm people and we felt like family. We enjoyed watching the nets being brought in and learned that Hassan had made them.He also explained the sea life caught in the nets which was very interesting. Swimming was great. We LOVED the food...all homemade with local products of which most were from Antonia’s garden. What an authentic day. Also want to say Antonia answered my messages quickly. Michalis and Antonia were waiting for us when we got off the ship and we returned to the ship at our prearranged time.Relax, Enjoy and Eat. It doesn’t get better. Thank you for the memories.",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"

Highlight of Havana!,"EVERYTHING was EXCELLENT! Gloria's quick responses to my emails were much appreciated. Irina, our tour guide is the Greatest!!! ( Please tell her one more time) She is professional, polite, friendly and very knowledgeable. Her accommodations for our limited walking abilities was much appreciated.......and we did see lots of Havana.
Jerry is telling everyone about his convertible ride in the red and white 1956 Mercury with Chinno. (We did the walking and convertible ride tour). At the end of the tour we felt we had a good knowledge of Havana and Cuba in general.
Our tour with Cuba Outings was the HIGHLIGHT of our Havana/ Varadero vacation.
Thanks again. (and if a potential client is wondering... yes,we did tip Chinno and Irina for their excellent service)",Date of experience: February 2019,Cubaoutings,5,Cuba
