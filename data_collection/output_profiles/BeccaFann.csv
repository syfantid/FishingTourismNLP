Highlight of our trip!,"We had the treat of spending the day with Nikos and Frosso and just one other passenger. The day felt so natural and relaxed, as if they were our friends and we were just joining them for a day of fishing and island hopping. They both took extra care to show us the beauty of their home, to feed us constantly, and to tailor the trip exactly how we wanted. Highlights include learning about the local fishery, swimming in the bluest water we have ever seen, watching them reel in the fishing nets to see what we had caught, enjoying a home-cooked lunch of fresh fish, squid, macaroni, salad, and delicious wine, all prepared on the boat by amazing Frosso! We felt like family and were sad to say goodbye to them at the end of the day. A perfect trip for couples, friends, or family, we hope to come back someday!",Date of experience: September 2019,Milos Fishing Experience,1,"Milos, Greece"
Beware. Not as pictured. Not luxury.,"Beware. This place is a total scam. Overpriced to begin with, but terribly rundown and understaffed. Not to mention sketchy business practices, dishonesty, and sneaky fees.

The grounds are beautiful and it's certainly a peaceful place, but better for a day hike or quick visit than a weekend stay. That's mostly because of the staff.

When we arrived we were lead to an old, buggy yurt with a stained bedspread, located a couple of feet from several other yurts. It's less seclusion and more like a crowded summer camp environment. Showers were located in a separate building and it was very hot. Nothing luxurious about it. The grounds and lobby area are worn down and dilapidated, and the front office seemed surprised about our arrival. There was only one other guest on the property, and the entire place had a haunted house feel.

We decided to leave since this was not the kind of place where we wanted to spend any additional time, but the manager said it would cost us $300 (nearly the cost of our two nights at the yurt) in cancellation fees. She offered to show us one of the rooms in the (empty) house, and offered us an upgrade since no one else was staying on the property. We checked out the room which was significantly nicer than the yurts with a nice bathroom, good bed and sheets, and a nice view of the grounds. We still weren't thrilled about staying on the property, but didn't want to waste the $300 and struggle to find somewhere else to stay on a Friday afternoon. We agreed to stay in the room, and traded in our yurt keys for room keys. Note - There was no mention of fees then or at any other time during our stay.

When we checked out, we were emailed a bill which showed two $75 charges for ""upgrade fees"", something we had never heard about before. I inquired with the front desk who took 24 hours to get back to me, then made up a story about informing us of the fees and how we agreed. They then wrote a long list of all of the ""value"" we got from staying in the room, and how much money we ""saved"" by getting the upgrade. Keep in mind, we were charged additional money. Subsequent phone calls and explanations were dismissed.

It's very disappointing to write a review like this, especially when we loved the idea of a green place that's so close to nature, but we encourage everyone to stay somewhere else when visiting the Big Island, this place is sure to leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.",Date of stay: August 2019,Hawaii Island Retreat at Ahu Pohaku Ho`omaluhia,1,"Island of Hawaii, Hawaii"
