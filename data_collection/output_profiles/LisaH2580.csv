The best day out!,"From the moment you arrive, Antonia & the crew make you feel like friends.
Greek coffee & cake are served & then you set sail to the fishing nets.
We had a bumper catch of lobster & grouper. If you choose to you can help clean the nets.
Then you can swim off the boat whilst lunch is prepared on board. Everything is super fresh. The veggies, olive oil, wine are all produced by the family. We loved every minute. Thank you again Antonia- you're a star Ô∏è",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
My 50th Birthday present!,"What a brilliant place to celebrate a special birthday.
We were in the original building, overlooking Bar 24 but with garden view. Upon looking at other rooms, we realised we were in the most basic accommodation. Not a problem at all as we only spent out time sleeping & getting ready there.

The beach is lovely - seaweed is a daily problem but the hotel work tirelessly to clear it. The sandbags are there to prevent corrosion, again you can't beat Mother Nature. The beach is kept scrupulously clean & the staff are just amazing. Special mention goes to Eli who couldn't have been more helpful, smiley, funny and kind.
The events team also were super- David the lifeguard, Alex and Omar- outstanding!
Betsebe kept us very happy with a supply of any drink you could imagine.
We booked our restaurants for each evening & the food was just incredible - top notch.
Breakfast & lunch was at Palafitos- buffet style but fresh & a different choice every day, barbecue, fish market, tacos... we were never bored.
We booked a massage at the spa- there's an option to have it on the beach also.
Special mention to Larissa who made us feel so special.
Every single member of staff make this place what it is- simply the best.",Date of stay: November 2018,"El Dorado Maroma, by Karisma",5,"Playa Maroma, Mexico"
