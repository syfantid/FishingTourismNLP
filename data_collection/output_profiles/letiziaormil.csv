Amazing adventure,"Dimitris is the attraction. We really enjoyed the adventuring experience on boat. Beautiful places and beaches, a tasty fish lunch and a huge and delicious macedonia.
A great company full of a great sense of sharing. Dimitris made all of this more enjoyable thank to his positive and polite attitude. He was one of us in every funny moment.
One of the best experience to visit an island through the eyes of a great sailor!",Date of experience: August 2018,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
