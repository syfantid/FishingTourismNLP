brilliant trip,"We had a fabulous day on this trip. A boat trip, few hours fishing,( everyone caught a few ) . Then swimming and snorkeling near the caves while the fish was being cooked on the bbq. The smell was amazing, so back to the boat to eat. A must do trip.",Date of experience: August 2020,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Highly recommended,"Very nice guy, and a great service at very reasonable price. Thanks Tony, having the bike made the holiday. I will be back",Date of experience: August 2020,Rent a Moto Tony's,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Shocking service,"Just returned from holiday to Bristol airport, got out to the bus at exact time it was due because bags were late. The coach hadn't even pulled off but the driver ignored me waving him. I stepped in front of coach and he just shook his head and started to pull off. We are now stranded at airport with a young child at 4.15 am. Looked on website to complain and you need to phone them at a cost of Â£6 plus network charge. Shocking how this can be legal. Avoid at all cost",Date of experience: June 2019,National Express,1,"Birmingham, United Kingdom"
Amazing value for money,"Here for our 3rd visit and even better than last time. Food is excellent, staff all very friendly and helpful. Hotel has been partly refurbished since last year, our room is very nice. Please dont take notice of bad reviews, I really cant understand how anyone could leave bad feedback for this place ,especially for the money. Best all inclusive holiday we've ever been on",Date of stay: June 2019,Lymberia Hotel,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
