Best food in town,"We went to ""Vasilis"" tavern with a couple friends last week. Vasilis was extra kind and generous with us. He treated us with appetizers and desserts free of charge as well as with a whole melon from his garden for takeaway. The food itself was amazing. Everything is homemade. All vegetables are cultivated by him in his garden and every meat is from his animals. We had some duck (one of the few if not the only one with Fresh ducks and not freezed). His wine is also made by him. Overall Amazing experience. I would totally recommend it. You will certainly NOT regret it. And also super great prices.",Date of visit: August 2020,O Vasilis,5,"Naxos, Greece"
One of the best deals in Rhodes,We went on a fishing trip with Makarounas today and it was fantastic. One of our friends felt sick of the sea and they took care of him. Captain Vasilis and Mrs Asimina were very polite and kind. We went fishing and had a bbq on board. Food was great and overall a great experiennce. Only thing id change is to have a bit more time to fish other than that 10000% recommend it. You won't regret it i promise.,Date of experience: August 2020,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
