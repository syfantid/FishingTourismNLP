0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeoAMav,August 2020,5,Excellent fishing tour in Santorini,"Captain Anthi and her crew are wonderful guides with deep knowledge of the art of fishing and love for their island. This tour was the highlight of our vacation, as we got to explore the real gems of Santorini, catch fish and the unique red tiny shrimp and enjoy authentic fisherman's cuisine. A must do while on the island, definitely suggest for family and friends and would gladly do it again."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happy2travelyou,August 2020,5,An unique experience not to be missed when in Santorini,"We decided to try this experience to celebrate our 15th marriage anniversary and it was the best decision! Arvaniti, the capitain, was the perfect host and together with Mohamed offered us a wonderful sunset trip including fishing, dinner, drinks and good mood. We highly recommend this experience to all people of all ages. We will definitely try this tour next time when we will return to Santorini! Our recommendation is to choose the sunset tour so you will have unforgettable sunset views."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TwisterDK2300,August 2020,5,The best Santorini boat trip,"Every time we go to Santorini we go on this trip.It combines authentic fishing, swimming, and the best seafood directly from the sea with a lot of information and knowledge about the animals. Captain Anthi and her staff - this year Mohammed - gave us again some of our best days of our holiday. You always feel so welcome on board - and all restrictions of the Covid -19 was respected this year. Every time it so exiting to see what's in the nets that have been set before the trip. Anthi knows every fish and other creatures in the sea and tells us with her great enthusiasm about them and answers all questions with a great knowledge. While swimming in the sea or fishing with your own fishing lines the staff prepares the catch of the day on the grill. It'll be served with rice, bread, frish tomato salad, and grilled squash - a meal which never will be the same dependent on the catch.  There might be two trips per day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon that includes the beautiful sunset. Don't hesitate to sign up.....it's a trip you'll come back to.....anyway we do....."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misspeppery,August 2020,5,Wonderful fishing trip!,"We were so lucky to be able to book a tour last minute! We had such a wonderful time learning about the different methods of fishing used.  Assisting Mohammed remove the fish caught in the net was a great highlight.  He and Anthi explained the different species very well. They prepared the days catch in several different ways, all of which tasted amazing.  Of all of our meals we had during our stay, this was by far my favorite.This is a very enlightening tour.  Anthi and Mohammed are wonderful hosts, and we could not have asked for a more pleasant experience."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JHleigh,July 2020,5,Wonderful day,"We did this fishing tour in July. Everything was great. Comfortable transportation from our hotel to the port, amazing fishing experience, fun snorkeling, so delicious and quite unique seafood dish, very kind and experienced captain and beautiful sunset..... Moreover, it was very private.(So, I felt that we were totally 'safe' during this tour in this tough times. )It was the best experience in Santorini. I strongly recommend this tour."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnHolidayM,July 2020,5,Idyllic,"Anthi and Mohammed were unpretentious, welcoming, and knowledgeable. We had such an enjoyable afternoon/evening. It really was idyllic and the food was delicious!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AthensMama,July 2020,5,One of our best memories ever!,"Captain Anthi is such a sincere, hardworking Super Lady. She and Mohammed took such good care of our family. Watching the live shrimp and fish come out of the water, wriggling out of their nets was exciting for the children. Anthi gave a biology lesson, explaining the features of the various fish and cuttlefish that were caught. They were eco friendly, too, throwing back those too small. Then, we swam and ate the fresh catch —-the shrimp were deep fried and delicious —-like shrimp flavored potato chips!  The fish and eel were grilled. The Greek salad was so tasty, grilled zucchini and white Santorini eggplant too, with bread and a rice pasta dish, heavenly! I drank too much white wine and had to nap.  Anthi taught the children two fishing methods, one with bread and the other using shrimp and cuttlefish as bait—we caught several fish, including 2 that were grilled for us. We threw the other ones back. I highly recommend this experience, especially for those with children. It’s a fantastic memory of Santorini."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Olgie_G,March 2019,5,Amazing experience,"My husband and I did a sunset fishing trip back in 2018 and I've been thinking about writing a review ever since. It was a fantastic experience.  We try do some sort of fishing on all of our travels and this was by far the best one yet! It was different from most fishing trips with less focus on casting and catching fish, and felt way more authentic. I felt like I joined a bunch of fishermen (and women) for a day of fishing, which is just the vibe we were looking for. We caught a whole bunch of different species including a few octopus and lots of shrimp. All of this made for the most delicious dinner. I still dream about that shrimp! We got to do our own casting as well, go swimming and help out with the nets etc. as much as we wanted to. My husband was fully involved in the whole process, while I enjoined watching it all with a drink in hand. We also had a great group of people on this trip (a bunch of couples around our age) so that was icing on the cake. The best part was our captain Anthi. She went above and beyond to make sure everythig was running smoothly. I have so much respect for what she does and hope this turns into a very successful business for her.10/10 in every way. Thank you Anthi. 2.5 years later and we still talk about that trip as best one yet.*Tip...bring motion sickness pills if you tend to get motion sickness"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mtnanative,October 2019,5,Great tour!,"My husband and I originally booked the morning tour with fishing and lunch but had to reschedule our booking due the weather. The captain was able to get us on an evening tour. Although we didn’t get to fish as we originally planned the experience was just as amazing! They took us to the opposite side of the island than they normally do due to the wind so we missed the white sand beach which I was also looking forward to.We got to experience them pulling in the shrimp pots and nets that would be providing us with our evening meal. Then we got the opportunity to swim in the Aegean which is a must while there. While they prepared our meal, we did get to “fish” with hand lines which was a fun little addition. The fresh cooked fish and shrimp was by far the best part. My husband is a fisherman and a charter boat captain so we are picky about our seafood and this was just phenomenal. They provided wine and other beverages, and a yummy salad to accompany the fish and shrimp. Definitely a memorable experience. We finished the tour with getting to watch a beautiful sunset. The crew and the captain were amazing all along the way and I recommend this tour for everyone. Next time we hope to get the morning tour! "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rosetoo76,October 2019,5,An Amazing Experience,"We had a wonderful time with Anthi and her Mates.  We could not have asked for a better experience.  The knowledge of this crew is off the charts.  We had a great day at sea catching an octopus, eel, barracuda, shrimp and my very own sardine.  We ate everything we caught thanks to the culinary expertise of the crew.  I would do this all over again in a heartbeat!  Excellent experience."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mona_og_,October 2019,5,Fantastic experience! ,"Anthi, Mohammed, & Marco (Amr) were without a doubt amazing! Very knowledgeable staff & simply just great people! We both tried fishing for the first time & it was actually really fun! I caught my first little fish too! Keep in mind if you do get motion sickness easily which I do, to get some of that medicine (as I got from a local pharmacy there) to help as I felt every wave in the sea lol We did the morning one, and it was so fun too see how they retrieve the catch from the previous day & just see the island from a different perspective & view! Also, it was very relaxing to just be out at sea with a smaller tour. Definitely recommend!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kylec609,,5,Highly Recommend for a day on the water,"My wife and I had a great time on a morning fishing trip with Giorgaros fishing. We were looking for an event to get out of town and also was a bit different than the typical tourist/romantic activity in Santorini. Fishing and eating fresh seafood was also something we wanted to do on the island so that was also a plus.We had a great time fishing with our wonderful captain and her crew along with the other guests on the boat. Its a more casual boat and atmosphere but has enough creature comforts to satisfy everyone.Safety is also a priority. The captain had postponed the trip a day due to weather conditions she saw as not ideal. While disappointed at first we realized that she took the trip's safety and satisfaction seriously. A trip the next day was an option so we got to go out then and had a great time. The fishing is as much ""hands on"" as you'd like it to be but the crew does the bulk of the work. You're also allowed to hop in and swim at a certain point of the trip. Snorkeling is available. The food cooked on the boat is great and fresh due to the recent catch. The Greek beer and wine that's included is also a nice touch."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fuzzybasset,October 2019,5,A great way to mix it up from the typical catamaran,"We wanted to get in some fishing while on Santorini. The typical “fishing charter” is not really available here, but we are so happy we found Athina, Marcos, and Mohammed! We had a great evening of food, fishing, and learning about the local fisheries. The food they prepared was tasty and Athina is so knowledgeable. The boat was not overcrowded and it was perfect as we weren’t looking for the party not atmosphere of the catamarans. I would highly recommend this boat trip for families, couples, or individuals who want to spend some time on the water in Greece."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/858rong,October 2019,5,Fantastic Experience,Very unique experience. Absolutely loved this experience and I am not a person who loves fishing. Just being out on the water and learning about how they use the Nets was interesting. The Captain and crew are awesome. Cooked all the food and everything is top notch. Do this!!
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ibmiller,August 2019,5,Highlight of the trip,Amazing and authentic fishing experience for me and my wife. The crew was very friendly and cooked an excellent lunch.Anthi (the captain) was very kind and knowledgeable
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dayanc2015,,5,Fun day at sea,"Amazing fishing tour, I booked it because my fiance loves fishing, the captain of the vessel was an amazing woman whose family tradition is fishing. She took her time to explain to us about the fish, the fishing methods and warned us about the poisonous fish. They cooked a great and abundant meal on board and we got the chance to snorkel and fish with a line. 100% recommend."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MollyWilcox95,August 2019,5,Best part of our honeymoon!,"This fishing tour was the best part of our honeymoon! Our captain was this amazing woman who had been fishing all her life and she had lived right on the ocean with her family! She knew everything about the area and had so much knowledge and experience! We caught shrimp, eels, octopus, and a number of other fish! They had unlimited local wine and beer and appetizers for us while they cooked up all the fresh fish we had just caught!!! It was incredible! We also got to swim and snorkel in the bay and then watch the sunset on our way back to the port! It was such a great experience! Highly recommend!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mwalick,,5,INCREDIBLE!!,"This is an absolute must if you want something different, off-the-beaten-tourist-trap-path and to come away feeling like you lived like a local for a few hours.  My husband, 15yr old son and I had a fabulous time and are still talking about it.  The excursion only allows for 8-10 ppl maximum so you will experience a very personal, intimate and super informative excursion.  There is no one on a loudspeaker nor are there earplugs—-you will feel as though you are simply going to work with the local fishermen for the day.  Our beautiful captain Anthi was amazing and so knowledgeable having grown up on the island and learning the trade from her father.  Our trip included swimming and snorkeling in the crystal clear sea, and then enjoying the most delicious and freshest catch along with grilled vegetables and bread I have ever tasted —grilled and prepared on board by Anthi, Marcus and Mohammed.  The beer, wine and non-alcoholic drinks were unlimited.  We had another couple on the trip with us and we enjoyed a few glasses of wine with them over lunch and getting to know them.  I cannot recommend this enough!!!! —Melanie from California, USA"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plh66,July 2019,5,The best experience of our vacation,"Anthi, the beautiful, friendly and fun Captain, made our experience so great. My grandsons loved it so much we booked it a second time. This was a unique and amazing experience. Highly recommend!,"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craftinganexpatlife,June 2019,5,"Love, love, love.","We spent almost three weeks exploring and touring in Greece and saw many things and went on many adventures but I think that this tour was, by far, the most amazing of all. Not only was it highly educational but it was just a good party! It was an interactive tour where you learned about the catch that day as the fish were unraveled from the net, you could touch and hold some of the fish too. I loved that we were able try to fish for ourselves with rods and lines. We could swim around the boat if we wanted to and the freshly cooked meal prepared by the crew was absolutely spectacular. I mean, seriously, the best meal we had our entire three week trip. We loved this amazing adventure and will rememberer it as one of our family’s favorite memories and experiences ever."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilysB1570YO,July 2019,5,Best activity we did in Santorini!,"We had an AMAZING time! The crew was welcoming, helpful, and extremely knowledgeable on the different types of fish we caught in the ocean! Out of everything we did in Santorini, this was the thing that we loved the most. The food was also incredible. The crew cooked up the fish/octopus that we caught, and had a variety of other dishes like Greek salad, rice, zucchini, shrimp, wine, and all different kinds of beverages. I would HIGHLY recommend this experience!!!"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sherpa324267,July 2019,5,Morning Semi-private fishing tour,"Simply amazing!The captain and her crew were wonderful. We caught so many fish in the net, shrimp in the traps as well as 2 octopus and an eel. We ate our catch for lunch- it was the most amazing experience. A must do if you have an overnight stay in Santorini."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcpathens12,July 2019,5,Authentic Aegean Fishing Trip,"Exceeded all expectations despite glowing reviews! Must, must do. Captain Anthi puts you on the bite. And her crew is competent and friendly. Just as all the reviews have stated earlier. That would be enough for a great day fishing. But these folks go way beyond. Anthi was constantly teaching and educating our family. She taught the adults and teens technique, species, history, and conservation. She protects the sea and has an incredible passion to teach others to do the same. We've fished fresh and salt around the world. The Giorgaros tour is at the top of our list!"

4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/177johnt,June 2019,5,Captain Anthia and crew are the real deal. What a great experience!!,"This is not so much as fishing trip (there are plenty of places around the world to do that...Santorini is not really high on the list) as it is an extremely authentic commercial fishing boat experience. Pulling up the ~800 meters of nets and a few dozen traps, learning about each and every species that we caught, and having a literal fresh feast was amazing. Not something you get to do in many places. We were a family of four (kids 22, 25) and all agreed that it was a true highlight of our trip to Greece. The handlining, snorkeling, and sightseeing along the coast were a nice bonus, but the real gem in this outing is Captain Anthi and her crew. Seeing them manage their traditional fishing boat and hearing her passion about her family and her lifestyle made this a truly memorable outing. The very best Santorini has to offer."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sannaengqvistschmitz,,4,A fun trip,"My son and I went on the fishing-trip this morning, had lunch on the boat, used fishing-rod and took a swim. We were haooy and the staff was great. Even though it was only for of us it didn't matter. More value for money, it was like a private tour. Thank you so much, we really recommened your company. 4 out of 5, the minus was because my son didn't catch so much fish but that was of course not your fault  / Best Regards Martin and Kristoffer, Sweden "
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fleur917,June 2019,5,Beyond Amazing!,"I can't say enough wonderful things about this experience. Everything was beyond our expectations. Anthi is amazing! She is so knowledgeable and kind. She made sure to check in with everyone and give each person attention to create a really lovely atmosphere. Her crew is wonderful as well. We were able to do it all. We watched as the crew brought up shrimp, fish and octopus, all of which they cooked to provide us with a delicious dinner. We were then able to swim, fish, eat, drink and watch the sunset in a beautiful setting. Everything you could need is on board including towels and snorkeling equipment. We were so glad that we got away from the crowds on Santorini and had a really unique experience. It is worth every penny, don't miss this experience.This was one of the best experiences we have had and we can’t wait to come back and do it again. Thank you so much for a beautiful and unforgettable day!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8803HVemilye,,5,"Highly recommended, we loved it!","We took the semi private sunset tour, and loved every minute of it! Anthi (the captain of the boat) was brilliant. She was knowledgeable about all the fish we caught and ate, and was also very warm and welcoming. She taught us some of the tricks of the trade, including how to eat the fish we caught!In addition to the fishing, we swam in a beautiful bay, and after eating a huge amount of delicious fish, we watched the sunset. There were only a small number of us on the boat, which meant the tour felt very private and special!Thank you so much. "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R5960TSkaylac,June 2019,5,A++++++++ staff and experience!,"My family and I had an absolutely incredible time on this experience. We got to see the beautiful rugged Santorini coast and three different colored beaches- black (I learned from volcanic ash), red (from iron), and white (from marble), while the experienced staff explained to us all about Santorini's history, coastline, and fishing. We pulled up nets of shrimp and the staff cooked them for us on the spot- so delicious! Then we pulled up nets of fish and caught fish, too, while they grilled and fried them and we ate them right on the boat. The food was amazing and it was so helpful and special to hear from the staff their personal stories and experiences of the island. We got to jump in the water, which was chilly and refreshing but not freezing, see the sunset, and spend time together not only as a family but meeting the awesome other 7-8 people on our boat. 10-12 people per boat is a perfect number for a cozy group. Thank you for sharing with us your knowledge and making me see why Santorini is such a wonderful place! "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JodyH777,,5,An excursion of a lifetime,This was a highlight of our visit to Santorini.  Anthi is so very proud of what she does and her heritage.  It bleeds through in all she does on the fishing trip.  Her crew is very helpful and cheery as well.  We truly enjoyed every minute.  It was very informative to learn about several aspects of fishing from traps to nets to hand lines.  We strongly recommend this fishing experience.
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veragazi,,5,Unforgetable experience,Celebrating my sons birthday we have chosen the fishing tour. As Greeks we found this genuine and unique. It reminds me my fathers fishing nights. Anthi and her team are immaculate. Anthi is not only born as a Mermaid but she holds a Masters degree in Political philosophy and a long family history in Restaurants. Her physical nobility and warmth makes your day THE SUMMER DAY  IN SANTRINI’ S PARADISE
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DRW1100,,5,My favorite part of our Santorini trip! ,We did the sunset cruise and dinner and semi private tour. It was absolutely wonderful. So much fun! The captain was friendly and knowledgeable and her passion shows on this trip. We made friends with the four other people on the boat with us. The fish was amazing and cooked so well. It was so much fun seeing them pull the fish and shrimp and OCTOPUS!!! from the nets and traps. We even got to fish with poles and swim and snorkel in the cove. I would recommend this to everyone. I am so happy we booked this!! 
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenm105,June 2019,5,Highly recommend!!,We decided to do this trip...different from all the sunset cruises that are offered. We are so glad we did. Anthi was great as were her crew. Interesting to see how the traditional fishing is done. The onboard lunch of all the fish caught was exceptional. You can partake in as much or as little as you wanted. I would highly recommend this excursion over the regular catamaran cruises. She comes from a long line of fisherman. Nice to see a woman at the helm. Probably one of best days on Santorini. Thank you!!!! 
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/930lynnx,May 2019,5,So many fish!! ,"Me and my friends don’t have much experience fishing but were still able to catch a ton of fish! The boat lays out nets and traps the morning of or the night before which they pull up for you. They show you the array of fish and shrimp and explain which types they are. They are the only boat on the island who can catch the small shrimps, and boy are they worth it!! Fried whole and crispy. I love shrimp and these were some of the best I’ve had. The fish and shrimp are cleaned and cooked fresh on the boat. And then you have about 3 hours to fish with a pole or hand line. I recommend the hand line, it is the traditional way they do it on the island are were much easier than using poles. The staff are very helpful and will cook any fish you pull up on the spot. After the fishing they take you on a short tour of the sights. It was a wonderful experience and highly recommended!  "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinesH1104FJ,May 2019,5,Santorini Fishing Tour with Anthi,"Amazing experience with Anthi and her crew. A total of 8 people were on the trip, each picked up from various locations on the island and dropped off at the harbor. Anthi explained what we would be doing, she was very personable and her crew was amazing. We swam in amazing water, caught fish and shrimp  which was grilled and fried on the spot, and served with fresh salad rice and grilled veggies. One of the tastiest meals we had in santorini. I would definitely do it again. Anthi, Marcos and Mohammed thank you for such a memorable experience."
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alsnyd1,May 2019,5,Fishing Excursion,This fishing trip was one of my favorite experiences in Santorini! It was very authentic and I felt immersed in the Greek fishing culture. Our captain was very interactive and explained each fish/sea creature we caught. She has an incredible and impressive life story. The meal cooked with our caught fish was impeccable! It was easy arranging out pick up from our air bnb. There were only 7 on the tour which made it very personable. Worth every penny!!
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuliaS1205,May 2019,5,Fantastic experience,"We loved spending the day on the Sea around Santorini with Anthi and her crew. Everyone was friendly and professional from booking, questions beforehand, and during the excursion. The team made sure we had the best of scenery and food. A great trip."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/679samanthao,May 2019,5,Great trip!,"Anthi was a great host and captain! We were able to go fishing, swimming, and eat tons of different types of fish and seafood. Shrimps were amazing and super tasty! What a great experience! Highly recommend!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conorm763,October 2018,5,"Fantastic trip with passionate, sustainable local family run business.","I had a great day today, Anthi was warm from the first email to the goodbye hug. Anthi is passionate about fishing, the marine environment and conserving it and knows the local area like the back of her hand. She and her crew are great accompaniments with a huge diversity of experiences and range of knowledge sets, you'll certainly learn alot!We met up with her and the crew just after lunch and ventured out passing by a few spots where they showed us some traditional fishing spots and techniques, talking us through the local species and how they have changed over the years, (ask plenty of questions they're knowledgeable and you will get much more from it).Eventually after an hour we reached the local bays where we spent the rest of the trip fishing, eating and snorkelling and chatting with the rest of our party and crew, (we did not know one another but at the end we felt we were leaving friends).Brill trip, stop reading about it and just book it already."
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kukume11,,5,Fantastic experience in Santorini ,"Captain Anthi and her crew are fantastic guides and help you experience Santorini in a different wayWe had never done fishing before but they teach you and help you and in the end you get to eat what you catch! Fishing is done responsibly, any small catch is brought back to the water, and they don’t use any dragging nets that destroy the sea beds.While Anthi and the crew prepared everything for fishing you can do some snorkeling which is lovely. The food was probably some of the best we have eaten. Fresh salad, grilled veggies and rice with grilled and fried fish. Delicious. Extremely recommended and if we come back to Santorini we are definitely doing it again! We went as a couple but it’s also a great activity for families"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/384jinh,,5,Awesome experience and perfect tour,It was such a perfect tour including the cake which was prepared for my wife for her birthday. My son loved the fishing and watching them bring in the catch. The food was so well prepared and we even got an octopus which was really good. Can't say enough good things about Anhti and the crew. Ended with a wonderful sunset
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieHummelstown,September 2018,5,Fun Day of Fishing the Greek Way!,"My daughter and I joined Captain Anthi and her crew for an amazing day on the water!Not only did we see the beautiful coastine of southwest Santorini on an authentic wooden greek fishing boat but we were treated to a wonderful day of swimming , snorkeling, learning how to fish, catching fish and best of all eating fish! Captain Anthi made us feel so welcome and treated us like family. Anthi comes from a prominent fishing family in Santorini and shares her family's passion for it. We learned about the kind of fish we caught, some we could not touch (scorpion fish) but could eat and Captain Anthi made us aware of this. The feast on the boat was amazing and fish does not get any fresher than freshly caught. This excursion was a top highlight on our trip to Santorini. The nice thing about this excursion is that it is family run, not touristy but a wonderful cultural greek experience. This excursion is for people who like to fish and for people who just like to watch. Captain Anthi does have fishing excursions for more experience fisherman. Thank you Anthi for a great experience and wonderful memories!"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaFit,September 2018,5,Wow worth every penny!,"My boyfriend being a fishing enthusiast, we decided to boom this trip for end September. We were a total of 3 couples so it was very easy to make friends as it was a small group.The tour started quite close to the white beach where they pulled up their fishing cages and 800m long fishing net. They show you the catch as they pull them out. We had caught quite a few fish including squid and octopus!Then they let you swim and give you snorkelling equipment.  After they provide fishing rods and lines and fresh bait and show you how to fish. We caught some more fish this way which was very fun and exciting!After, they cook all the freshly caught fish on board and provide you with a huge buffet of fresh fish, seafood, homecooked rice and salad and plenty of yummy bread! We were stuffed!Captain was an amazing young lady who stayed with us and showed us everything she knew She was also interested in getting to know us and sharing our own experiences Also pick up from hotel and drop off at hotel was a great plus. Worth the price at 130 euro per person! Cheapest in Santorini!!!"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brookeyd88,September 2018,5,Great day,"A great trip with Anthi & crew. Swimming, fishing & eating the catch of the day fresh from the boat. Anthi was happy to give us information about the boat, the different fish, the areas we were visiting along the coast & the traditional methods of fishing in Greece."

The crew is extremely kind and good to tell us about the fish and what is special about them - and also very carefull to them - the small ones come back into the see....You also get the opportunity to catch your own fish with fishing rods or just a line. And we maneged !It's a fantastic trip and we highly recommend it to everybody.Paul og Lotte Hasen, Denmark"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z2661UObenjamins,August 2018,5,Fresh fish and unbelievable hospitality,"We were in Santorini for our honeymoon and this was one of the things we were most looking forward to. It didn't disappoint. Anthi and her crew were spectacular. She arranged pick up and drop off from the hotel, but was also able to accommodate it to picking us up from the Akrotiri museum since we were there instead. The boat is comfortable, clean and safe. It is a working fishing boat. It is not a luxury yacht with polo wearing first mates, but those are a dime a dozen and a different experience if that is what you are looking for. Got to take a swim in the sea while the crew was cooking up the first part of dinner of what was caught in the traps and nets. The fishing is fun and what we caught/cooked was great. Being from New England we know good seafood, but have never experienced the short order of ocean-->grill-->plate seafood like this. Certainly no one went hungry! Anthi and the crew told us which fish were dangerous to touch (spines, teeth, stingers, etc), which were good for eating, which to throw back. They'll help you bait the hand reels and unhook anything you catch if you are concerned doing it yourself. We did the sunset cruise. That alone is worth the ride out on the boat. Not to mention that there are snacks and drinks (beer, wine, water, soda) the whole trip as well. It was an amazing experience. Anthi truly cares about the culture of the island and wants her guests to have a safe, great and memorable time. She individually got to know us and make sure we each got what were looking for out of the experience. She might be the sweetest person we met on our entire honeymoon."

Most relaxing time I had. From the fresh catch straight to the grill was oh so real. Fresh sea food does not come fresher than that. Enjoyed meeting the folks on the boat. The swim was nice and at the end get to watch the Oía sunset. All in all I highly recommend this fishing experience. The host were great, kind, friendly"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCPNewYorkCity,July 2018,5,Fish! Swim! Eat!,"This was an amazing experience. The crew and captain were interesting, friendly and helpful. They only take a few people on the boat. We were 6. We pulled up nets with all kinds of fish and learned about each of them... many of which you probably have never seen if you live in the USA. Then you could relax on the boat, snorkel  or fish with hand lines. The captain and crew prepared all of the fish that were just caught- octupus, shrimp, etc Fresh fish straight out of the sea simply prepared on the boat was perhaps the best seafood meal we ever had. If you are looking for a serious fishing trip for big fish, this is not it but if you are looking to learn about traditional Greek fishing vessels, the different kinds of fish around Santorini , swim, relax, eat and do some light fishing this trip is for you. We had a great time! It was one of the highlights of our time in Santorini. *An added plus is that they picked us up and dropped us off at the hotel"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chriseggemeyer91,June 2018,5,Best Fish Of My Life,"For starters, the crew are three of the nicest people in the world: Anthi, the captain, is extremely knowledgeable and engaging, and Marcos and Muhammad were very nice to us, going so far as to let us be involved (to the extent that wrangling run-away Octopus is involved) in the process of hauling in most of the catch.After hauling in pots and net, Anthi and the crew will take you to a beautiful bay that makes for good swimming, and fantastic hand-line fishing -- we caught 6 fish among 3 people!Most importantly, though, the food -- I can say with complete confidence that this was the best seafood that I've ever had in my life, bar none. Not only did we have the opportunity to try fish that we had never even heard of, much less had available to us in the US, but it was all prepared simply. I like to tell my wife that, when we came to Greece, it was my duty to find the best charred Octopus (one of my favorite foods). We ate at some incredible restaurants, but this blew them all out of the water.When the time comes for us to return to Santorini, we will absolutely go again."

I can tell you that by the time we were done, everyone was ecstatic that they booked. You do not need to fish if you do not want to, rather once the fishing is done, you can lounge around on the boat or hop in the water. Captain Anthi and her crew went out of their way to make sure we were happy. Even if we did not catch as many fish as we did, it still was WELL worth the money. We ended up catching an octopus, squid, barracuda, hermit crab, eel, prawns and about 60 or so additional fish. The crew cooked the food up and we had more than enough to feed us 10x over. Well worth the money!"

Is a ”truly hands-on” experience. My son an avid fisherman was so involved in the whole process, Marco and Muhammed allowed him to be an active partipant. I thought he was staying with them! Then, to top it all, the fresh sea food delicacies cook for you right on the boat. My family and I loved sharing our table at the Agean Sea with these wonderful people.

She was born into a real commercial fishing family of Santorini that also owns a restaurant. She's been fishing these waters since she was 4 years old, worked in the restaurant, has a degree in philosophy, dancing, is a teacher, and can drive that big boat with her eyes closed.If I had to do my week in Santorini over again, I would have done this fishing trip first ... because I learned sooo much. This had it all: 800 meter nets, fish traps, swimming, a real feast (they cooked what we caught right in front of us), a sunset ... and most important Anthi's expert instruction about everything we saw, tasted, and experienced.She even gave me her personal ""Shrimp Sanganaki"" recipe (and if you don't know what that is ... you need to try it).This is not a ""sport fishing"" type of excursion.  Don't expect to catch 200lb Tarpon.  It's a very family oriented, cultural, educational, ""Anthony Bourdain"" type of experience ... run by incredibly talented people who love and care about the sea.

We knew that this was gonna be fun but did not fully appreciate how much fun we were going to have. I think the main thing that sets this tour apart from the rest is the warmth of Captain Anthi and her crew and the true passion she has for this. Our kids thoroughly enjoyed themselves on the boat and managed to catch their own fish using either hand lines or fishing rods. The fish and octopus were cooked on board and absolutely delicious. The superlatively hardworking crew and captain have something special here and we would recommend this over any standard sunset cruise. Kids get to swim as well and snorkels, towels and drinks are provided. There is a toilet on board the boat. We would recommend this to anyone who wants to do something really different in Santorini.

Its a must do for kids too. We had so much of seafood. Anthi's crew members cleaned the same and cooked it to perfection. Food was awesome too. Octopus cleaning is not easy at all but they did so well. Fish, shrimp and octopus were all so fresh. I am the same seafood outside will cost you almost the trip cost.

4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtT491AD,March 2018,5,Wonderful experience! Very accommodating and friendly people ,"I contacted the company about their sunset fishing tours. I would be visiting Santorini in the middle of March. As we communicated, Cap Anthi found out about my needs and she then told me that she could accommodate us on a private basis, which I agreed to. I subsequently found that she had to make adjustments to her own plans as, technically, her season hasn't started and her boat was undergoing its yearly maintenance or servicing, (the boat version, I'm a land lubber so I don't know the correct term.) She met us prior to the tour to get to know us. And also to ensure that she met our dietary needs. We ended up having a very nice chat and she even walked with us around that village and explained some of its history to us. The tour itself was amazing. Her dad, who has been fishing in those waters all his life joined us. Despite the language barrier, he made us feel very welcomed. The shrimps tasted fantastic. In fact, almost all the fishes that they cooked for us was fantastic. We got to chose which ones we wanted and they also added some tropical make sure we get to try as much variety as possible. Like it has been described, we could choose to participate as much as we wanted. I was perfectly happy watching as I know I would have simply been a fifth wheel. Seeing them pull up the nets and traps made me appreciate the amount of work that fishermen did to put those fishes on our tables. Would definitely go with them again when I visit Santorini again! "

First, shuttle service to and from your hotel; all the gear for fishing,snorkeling, and swimming (towels) is provided; the fresh catch of the day is cooked right on the boat (grilled or fried), with Greek salad, ouzo, wine, beer and soda included in the cost. The meal was so good, I couldn't stop eating the fish! You can help haul in the catch, and clear the nets, or just kick back and relax. I also want to mention that my girlfriend cannot eat gluten, so Anthi took great care to keep the fried fish (and orzo) separate from the gluten free food. We loved our time out on the Agean!

2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NazneenRahim,July 2017,5,Amazing Family Experience ,"The  beautiful and accomplished Captain Anthi and her crew are now family. Being a daughter of Santorini, she brought to life our experience by sharing with us her childhood memories of the Caldera. Our family which spans three generations, 4 seniors, 4 'middles, 4 kids ( 12 - 8), were very well taken care of. Where else's would we have been able to jump into the deep blue sea, climb aboard to have a meal of freshly caught seafood, cooked by a member of her crew. The best part, was my husband being allowed to fry fish and cook a FULL BLOWN fish curry on board. Enjoying that meal with Anthi and her crew was such a memorable experience. Anthi and her crew are special and we pray for the  success of Giorgaros fishing tours. Her respect for the sea and her knowledge of the area truly provided us with an authentic and unforgettable experience.Anthi, we are waiting for you and your fiancé ( apologies as I have forgotten how to spell his name) to visit us in MalaysiaWith much love, and heartfelt gratitude,Mima, Pipa, Aunty Aini, Uncle Shahar, Farid, Afzal, Liana, Ilham, Tara, Alia, Imtiaz and Nazneen"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petef347,September 2017,5,AMAZING costal views and HIGHLIGHT of our stay in Santorini!,"Before coming to Santorini I was dead set on fishing, after the chaos of planning and traveling I forgot to solidify a spot on this tour. Long story short I was connected by a third party to Giorgaros fishing. Some advice I can give is plan before arriving in Santorini, and also give the business a few days to respond because they definitely will!Anthi was the captain of boat and she made out your what it was, amazing! Their is a small van that is provided by the company that picks you up right outside ofyour hotel (which is awesome) and they take you towards Kalami beach and to the port where all fishing and yachting boats are. Our trip was about 5-6 hours and the price was unbeatable. Anthi explained a lot about the history of her family on the island and the fishing boat we would be going on.We pulled shrimp nets up first and probably caught about 13 dozen shrimp.We then drove to where the fishing nets were, we caught about 80-100 different fish!!!!!! 9 different species, some squid, some snails and hermit crabs were on the net too. I was in shock of how much fish we pulled up, I really was hoping to catch an octopus but catching a squid was just as satisfying.The crew, who was two other guys, were awesome as well... they cooked the fish on the grill, deep friend some and deep friend the shrimp. I forgot to mention this but when you get on the boat they have wines, beers, water and soda prepared already that you can grab at will throughout the trip.Overall we fished, grilled, laughed, and even swam right off the shores of the beach. I will definitely be back to catch an octopus next year!!! This fishing trip made my vacation and I was so glad it was Giorgaros, and that Anthi was the captain!"

KNOW this is traditional fishing with nets, pots and SMALLER fish. One of the people on our boat expected deep sea sports fishing and was disappointed. If you want that, and catching big fish, Giorgaros does private outings or this but you need to specify that. We were very happy to have great hosts, great food, beautiful scenery, pull up shrip, fish etc and enjoyed it immensely! Just know that if you want BIG fish, you need a private charter with them and book appropriately."

I really though that fishing is so boring just like here in Denmark but #Giorgarosfishing  prove me wrong. They combine it  with excitement and enjoyment. I was so amaze when i saw the big octopos, stingrays, shrimps and different types of fish. After done fishing we went near in the black beach. While the crew make food (the one we caught) my husband is enjoying snorkling in clear, clean and green water, that make us jealous with my son because we don’t know how to swim. Since my son and i dont know how to swim we just enjoy ourself fishing using the fishing rod and we caught some fish. After the crew finish making the food. We ate all together and while eating we talks a lot of things about fishing. Seriously! Mohammed make tasty food. My Family and I really LOVED the food they make and it really tasty. After we ate. While the crew prepared for the fishing net we are relaxing and enjoying the MOST FAMOUS SUNSET IN SANTORINI before going back to Port. Our fishing moment is worth to keep! Each moment is precious!"

It was one of our top highlights of our holiday! Anthe runs the most outstanding fishing boat experience you can find in Santorini. She's intelligent, a great inspiration and speaks excellent English. You can really sense how much respect for the sea she has and she certainly knows what she's talking about. We both had a thrilling time out on the ocean which was heightened by Anthe's love of what she does as well as her hardworking crew; Hassan and Muhammad. They were all so very nice, hospitable and wonderful to be around. After a short amount of time out at sea we reeled in the nets from the night before and had ourselves a wonderfully varied catch of fish and sea creatures. We even caught a lobster and an octopus!! Wow!The guys cook what they catch while you can jump in the warm, clear waters and then everyone eats together and has a civilised conversation before heading back to the harbour. I would highly recommend and thoroughly urge people to book themselves a trip with these guys...you definitely won't be disappointed. Simply wonderful. "

They encouraged us to help bring in cages and fishing nets full of fish and we were educated on the different species caught. They were well equipped on board with fishing rods, snorkeling gear and towels and they took us to a glorious swimming spot. To top off the tour, they prepared the catch and made us the most exquisite lunch. They are beautiful people who did all they could to make us feel comfortable.

On the way to the fishing spots we were given great information on the history of Santorini and then we saw the creels being brought in with shrimp and octopus. Nets were brought in with lots of fish all named by Anthi, they really brought the experience to life. Then in to the sea for a cool off whilst the fish were cooked for us and then some fishing ourselves. So much food and lots to drink too. They provide snorkels and towels and look after everybody on the boat it was a great day out, and on the way home some traditional music from friends of Anthi who were out for the day. Thank you we all enjoyed ourselves."
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lwarne1988,June 2017,5,Wow! You Have To Try This!,"I booked a private fishing experience for my fiancé's birthday & we had a blast. I emailed Anthi 6 months ahead (yes, I'm a planner, and that is NOT required for this) and she was so great at emailing me back, answering my questions & providing lots of info. A shuttle comes to pick you up from wherever you are and drives you to the port. Anthi meets you and brings you to the boat. It's a lovely boat! Much bigger than I expected. She offers drinks and puts out cookies to snack on. You sail out to the traps and nets first.  The traps are home made and are filled with beautiful red shrimp. You can help empty them if you want, we did of course. When the nets come up, the real excitement happens. You see so many different fish and creatures! We caught an octopus, a squid, cuttlefish, a lobster, eels and loads of different fish.Anthi uses nets that are fragile, that way. I dolphins get trapped, which I thought was pretty awesome.Finally you can fish with poles, swim, snorkel, you're free to hang out and do your own things while the crew cleans and cooks everything. If she offers you fish soup, take it! It's lemony goodness.There is something for everyone on these trips, and Anthi is so cute, intelligent and hospitable. I would take another trip with her in a heartbeat.Oh! I forgot to mention. As I said, I booked this trip for my fiance's birthday. Anthi had her boyfriend bring a cake! She even had a candle for him to blow out and we got to sing to him!!! Unbelievable, she is so wonderful!"

You start the trip at the marina (transport to and from your hotel is an option) and then sail out to empty the traps first. We had a ton of shrimp and even a huge star fish (which we threw back in)!Then you go to another spot and start pulling in the nets. You can be as hands on as you'd like, but there is no pressure! My husband helped with the cages and I helped untangle the fish. Anthi and the crew's knowledge of all the different fish is fascinating and their respect for the ocean is admirable. The crew cooks up the fresh catch for dinner and you can either help them prepare, go for a swim or both! They also have fishing rods and hand reels to try out. It was my first time with a rod and reel and I caught so many fish! I even hooked an octopus!! The whole crew jumped over to try to help me, but he was too feisty (apparently catching an octopus with rod and reel is very rare). What a thrill it was though! The food was delicious and then we cruised around to watch the sunset. Such a wonderful and unique experience, highly recommend it! Thank you Anthi for everything :)"

You will end your day, by admiring the beautiful sunset..Just a perfect day!Anthi is a woman from Santorini! During the cruise, she is very available and can explain you many things about the island and her family story is also very interesting!

My 13 yr old son wanted to go fishing and we contacted Giorgaros fishing trip with our hotel Consierge.  They were amazing and very professional a true family experience.  My son loves to learn about the different fish in the area and we caught an amazing variety in the local way.  Nets were set a day ahead and we harvested them the day of the trip, we caught lots of shrimp, cuddle fish, octopus and many fish varieties.  They fried some shrimp on the boat and provided lunch for us.  It does not get any fresher than that!!Big hurray for Giorgaros fishing tours for allowing us to join in their local fishing experience:) We will definitely come back. "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foyep,June 2017,5,Great day ! ,"We enjoyed a wonderful day with Anthi and her crew ( and her sister's gorgeous new born baby and beautiful little boy ) . She was such a lovely and kind person ( especially when I felt a bit sea sick ) and looked after us very well . Most of all though we loved to hear about her fishing family , how they live , what they do and feel her passion and pride . I loved the fact she was the captain !  We caught fish , swam in the sea and had a perfect meal of fresh fish on the boat . Met some other lovely people and had a very memorable day . Do this if you like the water and want to do something authentic . A great day . Thank you ! "

The captain Mohammed helped showed us the ropes from collecting the crates to scaling the fish. I have only great things to say about the whole experience. If you do only one thing in Santorini, this should​ be it."

It completely changed my perception to the sea and raised my awareness on the ritchness it has to offer. The best lesson on the man-nature essential relation. Great hosts, delicious fresh food and breathtaking sunset views around the magical island."

We set out and the crew pulled up 17 'lobster pots' where we found about 2-3KG of shrimps and a fearless octopus, the crew then pulled up 600m of nets and found about 5 kg of fish. We cruised on to a pleasant cove where we went snorkelling. After that we cast out a few lines for some token fishing. Meanwhile, Anthi and the other crew members barbaqued the fish and prepared a delicious meal. Finally we cruised out of the cove a saw a stunning sunset before heading back. This whole experience was absolutely brilliant and I would highly recommend this trip and wish Anthi and the crew success in the future."
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathancD7651IN,September 2016,5,"If you're looking for a more authentic, local experience","Anthi comes from a family of fishermen and takes you out on the same 5-hour fishing trip she enjoyed as a kid.  Along with George and Mohammed, you get to watch them pull in the traps (for shrimp) and nets (for fish) that they put out the night before.  The shrimp are fresh enough to eat live, and we got two octopuses in the traps as well.  Our fish haul was not as bountiful as usual, according to Anthi, but was still more than enough to feed everyone on the boat.  It was really interesting having her point out each of the fish as they were pulled in from the nets, giving a short description as well as their market price.  After pulling in all the nets, we then went to a calmer area closer to shore where we could lounge around, swim, and grill up the fish.  The fresh fried shrimps are a very addictive snack, and I must've eaten two whole fried fish myself.  The fish guts that were cleaned from the fish also make great bait for some rod fishing.  Just to top off the feeling of local hospitality, Anthi's father drove us to a bus stop afterwards, and then an hour later, happened to notice us still waiting for our bus and drove us into town."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristinaP2066,October 2016,5,Very Nice tour !!!! ,"My boyfriend and I wanted to see the traditional fishing in santorini ! They showed us the way they were doing it ! The cages and nets. It was a great learning experience. I had the chance to help them cleaning the fish while my boyfriend was fishing with a rod. It was so much fun! And then they cooked the fish old Greek style with lots of vegetables, salads,shrimps etc. with wine, beer, ouzo and soft drinks. We had the chance to go snorkeling and swimming! And the best at the end... Santorini sunset on the water ! Spectacular  Anthi ,George and the capitan were very friendly, kind and available to answer all our questions. P.S. The price is very decent compared to the other tours ! I recommend this tour to everyone. :)"
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coachmekristina,September 2016,2,Very Sad- You WATCH THEM Fish...,"We booked this tour thinking WE were going to get to fish- even sent an email before hand asking if we got to fish. This is NOT a fishing charter. You are watching them fish from traps and pull nets and they cook the fish on the boat and you go to a cove and eat and swim. We didn't bring bathing suits or an appetite because that is not what we set out to do- we set out to cast a line in the water- which didn't happen.Anthi was very sweet. George asked my sister and I if we were gay, and also wasn't happy that we didn't eat their food- which, fish that have been cooked whole really isn't my thing anyways- I don't tend to eat things with eyeballs!Overall, it was a nice boat trip- but should not be classified as a fishing trip. "
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/782tessac,August 2016,5,Really unique experience!,"If you have ever wanted to eat fish that was caught 20 minutes beforehand, this is for you! It is a truly awesome and unique day trip and everyone on board was fantastic. I highly recommend this activity if you want to try something a little different than what everyone does in Santorini. It is family run and very low key, I promise you'll have a great time! "

1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosiee153,July 2016,5,Fabulous trip,We had a brilliant day out with this tour. It was a unique experience being out on a fishing boat and watching the guys catch the fish - the lunch of fresh fish was something to remember! I'd highly recommend 
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bblerot,June 2016,5,Amazing authentic fishing experience!!!!,"Such a great experience to go and fish with Anthi. It has been a long time since I was looking for an authentic fishing experience... and I've found the best one in Santorini... 5 hours of fishing, eating fantastic shrimps and fishes, jumping into the transparent water... Everything was nice during this trip and I'll warmly recommand this experience to my friends. We even got 2 octopuses... So great!"
