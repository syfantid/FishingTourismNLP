Popped in for lunch whilst,"Popped in for lunch whilst passing, already off to a great start finding out it was dog friendly on arrival. Staff were amazing, everyone was friendly. Food was fresh and tasted really good. Not a bad point to mention about the lunch, even the dog received a 5* welcome. Will definitely be returning.",Date of visit: November 2019,The White Lion,3,"Wigan, United Kingdom"
Great value for money,"Me and my partner has an amazing time on this trip. Due to an expected storm a lot of boat trips had been cancelled, we rang up the same morning when the weather was now good and calm and were told if we could get down for 10 we could go ahead and if we were going to be slightly late they would wait. When we arrived the staff were very friendly and it turned out we had the whole boat to ourselves. What you catch you take to a local restaurant and they cook your fish to your personal taste. It makes for a really fun day. The staff are amazing and are constantly making you laugh. 5 stars!",Date of experience: September 2018,Captain Tasos,3,"KÃ³s, Greece"
Fair and Honest,"We are currently staying at the Bellevue. Like many others we were worried before arriving due to the reviews. We arrived an hour or two before the rooms were ready for check in but took advantage of the luggage room, then went to lunch and to explore, the Bellevue is a complex but with a map it is not hard to get where you need to go! The reception staff were very helpful and we were dealt with by Giovanni and Erica. The bar staff are all nice if you are nice to them and the maids always say hello as you pass them. We are all inclusive and the food is typical of a resort this rating. There is a place to book excursions on site but just out of the complex is a company called no frills who are a lot more helpful. All in all if you have already booked and are now worried just come with an open mind and enjoy it.",Date of stay: September 2017,BelleVue Club,3,"Majorca, Spain"
