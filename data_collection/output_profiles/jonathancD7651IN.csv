Truly a hawiian oasis,"Beautiful property right amongst nature. Stayed in the Aloha suite for two nights. The innkeeper Nina used to run a boutique cafe, so she can make as fancy a breakfast as you ask for. Her scones are also uniquely scrumptious. Would gladly stay here for a week or more. Just a perfect vacation home while enjoying the Kona coast.",Date of stay: November 2018,Hawaiian Oasis B&B,5,"Island of Hawaii, Hawaii"
Group lesson with JB was flawless,Booked a group lesson for me and my wife. Was just the two of us and JB out there. Completely perfect for beginner surfing. Shallow enough to stand up when you fall off your board. Two hours is plenty of time. Was able to go from falling off the board to riding all the way in to the beach by the end.,Date of experience: November 2018,"Goofy Foot Surf School, Inc",5,"Maui, Hawaii"
"If you're looking for a more authentic, local experience","Anthi comes from a family of fishermen and takes you out on the same 5-hour fishing trip she enjoyed as a kid. Along with George and Mohammed, you get to watch them pull in the traps (for shrimp) and nets (for fish) that they put out the night before. The shrimp are fresh enough to eat live, and we got two octopuses in the traps as well. Our fish haul was not as bountiful as usual, according to Anthi, but was still more than enough to feed everyone on the boat. It was really interesting having her point out each of the fish as they were pulled in from the nets, giving a short description as well as their market price. After pulling in all the nets, we then went to a calmer area closer to shore where we could lounge around, swim, and grill up the fish. The fresh fried shrimps are a very addictive snack, and I must've eaten two whole fried fish myself. The fish guts that were cleaned from the fish also make great bait for some rod fishing. Just to top off the feeling of local hospitality, Anthi's father drove us to a bus stop afterwards, and then an hour later, happened to notice us still waiting for our bus and drove us into town.",Date of experience: September 2016,Giorgaros fishing tours Santorini,5,"Santorini, Greece"
