Never been to a restaurant where the kids made their own pizza
Would definitely be a regular if we lived closer",Date of visit: December 2017,Macchiato Wood Fire Pizza & Coffee Roastery,1,"Sydney, Australia"
Best holiday for years,"This place is fantastic. We were greeted by Liana who took her time to show my family around & make us all very welcome. She speaks fluent English & her husband (Paulos Rush) is improving with his all the time.

The decor & garden is stunning and the rooms clean comfortable & spacious

The resort is unspoilt with lots of tavernas & shops within walking distance

Our children were safe & spoilt by the owners family & were very happy to help with anything at any time. Nothing was a problem

We tried to book again whilst there but no room were available and can see why, but will be back next year.

Lovely family whom we are still in touch with as this place is special",Date of stay: June 2017,VA Boutique Apartments & Suites,1,"Corfu, Greece"
Great food & location,"Lovely place run by a local family

Selection of authentic dishes as well as large variety of drinks on the beach

Offer free sun beds to customers in the day too",Date of visit: June 2017,Woody's,1,"Corfu, Greece"
Brilliant time,"Went with these guys in the evening for a leisurely fishing trip.

Great time. Focused on quantity rather than size at our request and did not fail to deliver

Nice food & drinks included at competitive rates

Thank you and hope to see you when we return",Date of experience: June 2016,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Mama Mia!!,"Took our 5 year old daughter here to see the only film relevant to the islands of skiathos & skopolos - Mama Mia

Had a fantastic night with entertainment laid on by the owners

Only down side (which stopped me giving 5stars) was the price for a small can of beer - €3.50!!! Too much should be 2 maximum!",Date of experience: June 2016,Open Air Cinema,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Really rude & pricy,"Loved this place to start off as the beach is stunning and its location level from the bus stops BUT sit on the sun beds they are €10 for two with a drink - which was great BUT the waiter decided on our 3rd visit we were no longer allowed there (after spending nearly €200 on food & drink) as his manager said so??? Didn't even see him? We believe it was more because we would not tip him every time

Ruined our day with his attitude and vowed not to return - was also told later by several taxi drivers it is illegal for them to charge for beds as they are free for all to use",Date of stay: June 2016,Skiathos Princess Hotel,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
No lifts & lots of steps/hills,"Spent 2 weeks here from 27th May to 10th June 2016

If you have restricted mobility or need push chairs etc - forget this hotel unless you are fit enough to manage 60+ steps and you hire a car

Staff at reception great, maids nice - some - waiters nice.

Food repetitive and not great unless you like greasy salty bacon, fried eggs, cheap sausages etc - not bad once but 14 days later the smell sticks

Prices went up whilst there by 1 euro overnight!!! Beer 5euro as is coffee. Worth it? No. You can get drinks from 2.50 in town - the main port area - so hotel is very expensive in comparison

Views stunning from all open areas

Sun beds taken with towels by 8am and often not used until 11ish. Very frustrating especially if you are a family that needs to be near the pool to watch the kids

Play area ok but often kids left to run riot with no parents in view - so young ones like ours had to be watched closely.

Rooms very tired but clean. Classic ones 1970s I would say and untouched. Modern ones had better furniture but still tired bathrooms. No double beds & never an upgrade available

Overall location is ok but isolated without transport.

If they spent money & modernised rooms and fitted at least disabled lifts, this could be a 5star hotel but they rate it four? I travel lots and have visited all types of ratings and believe this is without doubt a two star at best.",Date of stay: June 2016,Skiathos Palace Hotel,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Nice but isolated & no sun beds,"Boat trips always came there making it packed at times with bins overflowing with litter

Beach side shops ok & prices not too bad but higher than average

Bars & restaurants about 10mins away & recommend the restaurant 'under the pine tree'. Good food & great prices",Date of experience: June 2016,Koukounaries Beach,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
"Great people, great food & great prices","We are here several times during the day for lunch and tried all traditional dishes - nothing short of fantastic.

The owners are local family members and very very caring and accommodating as well as friendly

It looks like a take away with tables - but it is great

We ate in several places and this topped our informal list",Date of visit: June 2016,"Under The Pine Tree, gyros -souvlaki",1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Great food & views,"Lovely friendly family run taverna that makes you welcome from the outset

Food is great & service brilliant

Prices very sensible

Would recommend booking to avoid disappointment and ask for tables with views",Date of visit: June 2016,Infinity Blue,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Nice food in pleasant surroundings,"Nice quite location with great food & good prices

It's by bus stop 19 and has good access

Kids can play outside and the Greek owners are very friendly",Date of visit: June 2016,Green Meadow Restaurant,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Excellent Christmas party,"I took my family & friends here for the weekend and the entertainment girls (Becky & Nikki) made our kids stay very enjoyable

The Christmas Party was so well organised there was a Santa who was great with kids and gave them all a quality gift each, Christmas dinner, games, dancing etc all included in the party price of £7!!! Brilliant!",Date of stay: December 2015,St Margaret's Bay Holiday Park,1,"St Margaret's at Cliffe, United Kingdom"
Peaceful & friendly,"We booked this as a quiet retreat for 10 days as a young family. Perfect!
Lovely pool, lovely family owners, lovely weather!
Whilst some parts of the villa could do with modernising, it did not ruin our lovely holiday. I would recommend hiring a car - Marvik is best for this deal - ask him direct. I would also recommend hiring the car so you can drive yourself from the airport. I panicked and hired a transfer but wish I drove now as it was very simple to find and get around the island, across the ferry etc. (As long as you land in the day). No need to pre-book ferry - so don't panic!
The local supermarket is well equipped for meals and is about a 30min walk away. This is on the edge of Victoria so would say in total it takes 40 mins to Victoria to walk. If you hire a car, you can stock up on beer, wine, food etc and just leave it all in the house to consume as and when. The beaches on Gozo are mixed. There's 2 with sand. Ramla Bay which is very busy every day so get there by 9 to get a parking space - or San Blas Bay. This again is a very small bay, unspoilt and down a very very steep hill BUT there is a jeep that brings you back up for 2 euros (well worth it). Much nicer & quieter in our opinion. Great for the kids with you as there is nowhere for them to run off to and there are not many people there to moan if they build a sand castle or 2.
Eating out is hard as with 2 babies it is always difficult to get somewhere that is suitable. For the Chas & Dave's of the world (no insults meant) there is a McD's in Victoria. There is also a very good supermarket under McD's with a great butcher. We would often buy fresh meat and chuck it on the Barbie in the garden next to the pool whilst listening to some chillaxing music. There are enough facilities in the kitchen and variety in the supermarkets to make it a home from home and cook a lovely meal every night/day - up to you - we did.
There is a washing machine, 2 fridge freezers (one very big), washing lines, tv, dvd player with dvds (but take more if you like), Wi-Fi internet - ENGLISH plug sockets throughout so forget your adapters :-) The cable TV only really showed the news or animal channels so don't expect movies, sports etc
Whilst you are remote - it is an old farmhouse next to a working farm - so expect smells and sounds - but nothing bad at all - just nice.
There is a small bar in the village centre (next to the quaint church) which is like a tiny working mans club. This opens at approx. 730pm - 8pm each day. The locals are great - friendly and very polite - as long as you are too! We would pay 2 euros 20 for a pint of beer (out an ice cold can) & glass of wine - so not bad a? It gave you the feeling of being on holiday even if you were surrounded by locals instead of tourists :-)
Theres much to do in Gozo so research it first. Marvik will help you do this. We only went to Malta once and whilst it was great, Gozo has much history too and is very enjoyable. We were gutted to leave after 10-days but did feel very relaxed after.",Date of stay: June 2013,Ta Nikola Farmhouse,1,"Island of Gozo, Malta"
"Very hot, noisy & family room cramped","On arrival the room was hot, had too many beds and one even protruded across the bathroom door. I had to ask 4-5 times to get it moved over a course of an hour and a half, but in the end did it myself and folded the bed up and leant it against the wall. The babies cot should have been placed that side and reception kept saying they would be along, but by 930 the guy knowcked when my baby and teenage daughters were in bed???
During the night we were awoken by noisy guest arriving at 1130pm and again 1240am by someone else above us throwing up in their room.
Waking up at 4am was bad enough but with little sleep - even worse.
MAKESURE they tell you about the 'Goodnight Guarantee' they didnt tell us and can see why...
Don't get me wrong, one bad experience out of many uses of Premier Inns is not a bad thing, it was just this hotel. It needs staff training and aircon",Date of stay: June 2012,Premier Inn London Gatwick Airport South (London Road) hotel,1,"Crawley, United Kingdom"
"Great place - Quiet, Clean & Friendly","Staff are very helpful & friendly (especially great with a baby)
Upgraded to a family room - well worth it. Extra bedroom, spa bath, sea views & free wife, spa entry.
Great activities, food and location. Not noisy and about 20min walk to Malgrat.
Drinks reasonably priced for a Hotel. Well worth going Full Board as the variet of foods is brilliant and caters for all persons including diet food, glutton free, veggies blah blah blah",Date of stay: June 2012,Aqua Hotel Onabrava & Spa,1,"Santa Susanna, Spain"
