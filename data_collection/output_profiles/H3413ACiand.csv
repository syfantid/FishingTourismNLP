A Special Day,"Well the real highlight of a great 2 weeks in Kefalonia. Such a lovely atmosphere as soon as you step on the boat.
Efi & Dimitrios are the perfect hosts with all the information and humour you could wish for.
The whole experience was outstanding from pulling the nets, to swimming at the beautiful little beaches.
The fresh fish was amazing, as was the salads. It's hard to believe food of this standard can be produced on a little stove on a rocking boat.
If you want to do something a little different on Kefalonia then I suggest this as there are so many special memories to be had",Date of experience: June 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
