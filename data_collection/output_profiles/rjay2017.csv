Fantastic,"Its a wow - prawn linguine at its best - so flavoursome!! Wines are are pricey, but well chosen. A real treat!!",Date of visit: October 2017,Il Leone Mastrantonio,5,"Cape Town Central, South Africa"
Home from home,"Perfect setting, within walking distance of everything but still private enough. House is well equipped, and spacious. Could easily spend the day on the terrace instead of beach! Only info missing from the advertisement is that you need to be quite mobile to walk the 100m from road to villa. I would definitely stay in only that one rental next time - need nothing more!",Date of stay: July 2017,"Terrace over the Agean, villa with 3 bedrooms overlooking Ftelia",5,"Skiathos, Greece"
A must-do for bucket list!,"Captain Dimitris knows just what visitors should see and experience - it was amazing! Swimming in crystal clear water off the most beautiful beaches, and even went into deeper sea to give my boys the opportunity to fish a bit. Was a real hit, worth every cent!",Date of experience: July 2017,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
