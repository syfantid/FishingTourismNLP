First trip during COVID,"A first trip out to a pub setting for two best friends. We felt safe with the one way system, certain tables not in use and table service. We had a lovely waitress Zoe who was friendly and helpful.
Food was lovely we had chicken escalope and salmon with pesto.
Recommendations would be that the allergen menu is clearer as it was difficult to work out what was available on the menu when the allergen menu had way more meals listed. We were told that this would be the case.
Also I would be great to have other alternative milk available other then soya. If so We would have stayed and had coffees if this was the case.
Plan to be back and do a walk when it is a little warmer",Date of visit: August 2020,The Cunning Man,4,"Reading, United Kingdom"
Wonderful trip ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ,"We are a local youth club with adults with additional needs. We frequently visit pots2paint and stef is amazing. Every time we visit the members can create wonderful items using a range of techniques that stef shows us. She is also extremely patient and kind. we that we are able to visit a quiet setting, spend time painting without feeling rushed and be able to ask an expert when needed. If you havenâ€™t been the venue is definitely worth a visit!",Date of experience: December 2019,Pots 2 Paint,4,"Basingstoke, United Kingdom"
Excellent home-cooked food,We visited this place after venturing round the countryside for somewhere to eat. We stumbled upon the pub and were pleasantly surprised. There was a good atmosphere and we were quickly served and show into our seats. Unfortunately they run out of roast dinners (however it was late on a Sunday evening) however we both had lamb dishes that were both Delicious. As many other reviewers have stated the main meals are big and we were pleased that we didnâ€™t choose a starter to begin with. There is also a good choice on the pudding menu but unfortunately we were too full!,Date of stay: September 2019,The Cheesewring Hotel,4,"Liskeard, United Kingdom"
Lovely room but didnâ€™t feel welcome,"As soon as we arrived at the crystal place hotel we didnâ€™t feel welcome and felt an inconvenience for the staff. We were shown to our apartment and shown how things operate in the room (all self explanatory) but this appeared to be a chore. We were disappointed as our travel agent we had booked through had told us how lovely the staff were. Unfortunately we didnâ€™t see this side of the staff.
We are a couple that tend to use a hotel for a base. We didnâ€™t have breakfast booked and this worked well. We instead had our own breakfast on our terrace. There was a small job, toaster and microwave too if you felt adventurous.
Be aware that air con is â‚¬50 for the week.
Overall the room was clean and the cleaners were lovely always saying hello.
The hotel is also well situated on the hill with a walk along the beach to Skala. Be aware that the steps are deep and could be tricky if walking is difficult.
There is a swimming pool and a bar available at the hotel. However we didnâ€™t use these facilities (which was possibly why we were treated like we were - ignored). This is reflected as to when we checked out as weâ€™re weâ€™re not asked as to how our stay was etc.",Date of stay: June 2019,Crystal Palace Studios,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely food and staff,"Ate here 3 times. we did eat in other places too but realised we were onto something good. Staff were lovely and remembered us each everyone. Enjoyed the sharing kebab dish, kefonlina meat pie as well as pasta and steak and ale pie. All food was delicious and responsibly priced.",Date of visit: June 2019,Galera,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Good but could been better....,"I feel I have to be honest on my review and looking at the previous 5* reviews unfortunately I donâ€™t agree.
Firstly it was great to be aboard a fishing boat seeing how the nets work and then to see the catch of day. Coming from a farmers background this was something we were interested in - seeing where our food came from. We caught lots of lobster and I believe ray.
The food on board was lovely and freshly prepared. However we felt that we had to eat the lobster, this was caught that morning on the boat however me and my partner had no intention of eating the lobster. (I know some people may think we were being fussy but this is the only food weâ€™re not keen on - were also werenâ€™t the only ones) and would have declined knowing that all the lobster was being cooked. We would have tried but felt pressured into all the lobster being eaten which then pushed us further into saying no thank you. We enjoyed the bruschetta (best Iâ€™ve ever had) and the spaghetti and soup. There is a lot of food provided.
Also we did stop for a little swim while lunch was being prepared however just be aware that the boat doesnâ€™t stop on a beach as mentioned in our itinerary. Instead stopping near cliffs. If you not keen on deep water (me) then a life jacket is provided. However I know some people prefer to wade in the water and feel that this is important for people to know. My partner enjoyed his swim.
We werenâ€™t sure on rough timings so wasnâ€™t too sure how long we had in the water - we had a long time (2+hours which was a little too long for us).
Overall this is a lovely boat trip if you would like to see how the fishing world works. However for us we felt it was a little too long and at times felt we had done wrong by not eating the lobster. Perhaps state to the crew that this isnâ€™t something you want to eat so they can accommodate you. It would have been nice to have been introduced to the crew too. It was nice to see a different part of the island and to be aboard a fishing boat eating freshly cooked food.",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Home cooked food!,"This was a lovely restaurant, very busy when we arrived but gorgeous food! We had the two of the meat dishes that are cooked in the pot. It was lovely! The only complaint my partner had was to have a piece of bread to soak up the sauce! The lady that runs the restaurant was lovely and friendly.
We found overall going off the main strip for food is useful as we found a few hidden gems.",Date of visit: June 2019,Socrates Taverna,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Good location, comfortable bed but....","The hotel was a good location on the tram, only a few stops from the main centre. we got a 24 hour ticket for travelling on the tram which was so easy and convenient any time of day night (the latest we travelled was 12.30am). we were also two ladies travelling and still felt safe on the tram.
Both me and my friend slept well in our rooms and the bedding was comfortable meaning that both of us slept as soon as out head hit the pillow (of maybe it was all the walking!)
The down sides of the hotel was that i didn't feel that we were welcomed very well at the hotel, we checked-in and through they were friendly, the bare minimum was said. We didn't talk to hotel staff again until the the final day when we checked out. We asked to put our luggage in storage as we went to the zoo (literally over the road) however the door of the storage room was left open for us and the member of staff walked off; however just a moment before he helped two others ladies put their suitcase away. My friend thought that the hotel was a self checking in/out hotel, however i felt it would have been nice for staff to say hello if it was quiet etc.
we also checked out the restaurant next door. we were not over fussed and instead preferred to go into the centre of the city. We did have breakfast at the plantage restaurant over the road and I enjoyed the granola and yogurt (yum and very filling), if you sit near the window there you can also see the flamingos in the zoo.
Also any english tea drinkers, it might be worth bringing your own tea bags with you as the ones in the hotel were not the same. Also there is no milk available (it might be if you ask) but only coffee creamer which was the same; just through this might be a top tip for some people.",Date of stay: May 2019,The Lancaster Hotel Amsterdam,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
