Great fishing day,"My family and I had the chance to experience fishing at Rhodes. Not only the fishing was big fun, the owner was an amazing host.
First we sailed along the walls and watched the inside of the port and old Rhodes from the see side. Then we sailed to fish.
We catch some nice fish all of us using the boat gear
The boat is well organized with good gear, small bits cups, good fishing rods, benches, shade and small chairs.
The owner was very helpful and with a friendly attitude.
We changed location to shallow water had a swim , some were snorkeling, while the fish where grilled on board.
The taste was great, fish and greek salad, drinks and nice sweet watermelon.
It was great time, high recommended.",Date of experience: July 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
