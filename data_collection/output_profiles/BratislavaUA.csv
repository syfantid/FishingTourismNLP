Very good hotel,"We always stay here once in Thassos - already 5 times over the years. Every time we come there is an new investment/improovement. Owner does take good care. Yes it is on a busy street - but once you close the door it is nice and sound proof, breakfast is OK, cleaning is OK, they change the sheets and the towels and the price is really good. Do not expect luxury hotel - it is a family run nice hotel price/ratio is very fair here. Central location is perfect for trips around the island, reception staff is kind.",Date of stay: July 2019,Hotel Olympion,4,"Thásos, Greece"
Professional team - good company !,"We have had an amazing experience with Vasiliadis & his team. The owner him self can not have more expertise in diving is a real PRO. Hand picked team members did their job pretty well, we were very satisfied. We went of to the island in Astris - an amazing colorful wall full of life. Our dive master Katerina was very nice and we felt safe with her - did not stress and made the dive easy going left us to enjoy it the way we wanted. Gear was overall good condition. Once back to Thassos we will go diving with them again... Bring your own water on board & some small snack.",Date of experience: July 2019,Vasiliadis Diving Club,4,"Thásos, Greece"
"Higly professional & Fun, Thank you guys!","From the booking thru the course and fun dives the whole team was just amazing. Local quality management of the company with reliable instructors mostly from Europe. The company has many many years of experince in management of a dive school. We were all new to diving and were so happy to pick Anti Gravity! Diving is fun but shall be taken serious - and the whole team built a lot of confidence in us thru out the 7 open water dives we did with them.
Sam taught us very well on our Open Water Padi - BIG UP to you man. Sarah did super well while guiding us under water. Lisa took us on our first Advanced Open Wtaer to a Sugarwreck. All of them are such a sweethears. Thank you guys!
