Thank you Captain Dimitri!,"We spent a week in Skiathos and the highlight of our trip was our day on Capt Dimitriâ€™s boat. He was an amazing host - bringing food for us and even swimming out a fruit platter to the private beach we anchored by. We got a full tour of the coasts of skopelos - even seeing where Mama Mia was filmed!!! Our 5 yr old son still talks about his buddy Capt Dimitri and asks us to go again. Without a doubt, will be contacting him again on our next trip to Greece.",Date of experience: June 2018,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
