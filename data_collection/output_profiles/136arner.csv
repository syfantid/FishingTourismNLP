The best trip one can wish for,"This trip is the most pleasant combination of secluded beaches, amazing seafood, great company and unforgettable fishing experience. Small group size allows guests to get to know true locals, the nicest people you can meet, Captain Gerasimos and the host Maria. Beautiful trip, authentic experience, oh and did I mention insanely fresh and tasty food?
In short, do yourself a favour and just book it.",Date of experience: August 2020,Poseidon Fishing Tourism Kefalonia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
