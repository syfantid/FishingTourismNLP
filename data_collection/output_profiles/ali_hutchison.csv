"Excellent, Fun Family Day out","Used All Out Adventures as part of a family fun day out quad biking, it was excellent and very fun, all the team at all out adventures were very friendly. Due to a mess up at the hotels end on a pre booked spa day, All Out Adventures accommodated us to then do a 4x4 experience also instead at short notice and as it was my birthday and due to the disappointment for the cancelled spa, they even threw in a complimentary go pro of our 4x4 experience, how nice of Suzanne and the team,thank you! Ian the instructor was on the 4x4 and was very professional and fun and made us feel well at ease with his advice, never thought would get a land rover into so many precarious positions, great fun! A first for all the family on quads also, my 13 year old had a brilliant time and wanted to spend the whole day on them! I definitely recommend the 4x4 and quads for a fun family special treat, ok my son was a passenger on the 4x4 but he equally had fun being a passenger, we all had a brilliant time, and it was a real highlight of our holiday. Book it, you wont be disappointed.

Brilliant Day Out!,"We spent the day with Effy, Dimitrios, Mohammed and Eva on the 1st Aug to celebrate my dad's 70th, superb day had by all, the team attended to our every need, so friendly, my 10 year old son got involved in assisting with the mornings fish catch, hauled in red mullet, barracuda,scorpion fish, several squid the list went on and in. Moored up on beautiful remote beach, whilst snorkeling we were cooked a superb meal by the talented Effy, delicious food all round, tasted lobster, along with home grown vegetables, wonderful day, our group did not want it to end and Effy and Dimitrios truly had a great day with us also. Cannot recommend this trip enough, they will do their upmost to accommodate any special requests your group may have I'm sure. So friendly and a definite trip we will not forget. My dad had a day he said he'll never forget.
Thank-you to all your team and hope to see you again one day!",Date of experience: August 2016,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
