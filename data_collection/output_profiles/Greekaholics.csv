Find The Spy!,"Great evening at the Bletchley! The staff were brilliant, particularly the General and the Sergeant (the Austrian girl), and of course the cocktail makers and other ""helpers-in-arms"". We really enjoyed the mystery quiz to locate the spy. Well done all!!",Date of experience: October 2019,The Bletchley,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Great Day's Fishing and Swimming!,"We had a fabulous day with Dimitris and Efi. Helping to take fish from the nets, then 2 swimming stops, then a lovely lunch prepared by Efi from the fish caught plus salads and wine etc. This was one of the best days of our holiday in Katelios, Kefalonia. Thank you Dimitrios and Efi, and Mohammed the crew man.",Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner!","Great Taverna. Very good food and friendly staff. The Kefalonia meat pie was the best! Although all the tavernas that we visited in Katelios were of high standard, this was the one we returned to most often. Thanks to all, particularly Louisa and Beta.",Date of visit: September 2019,Katelios Taverna,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
