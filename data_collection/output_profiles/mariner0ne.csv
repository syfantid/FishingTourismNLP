Queen Victoria crew members outing,"We are professional seafarers with diverse backgrounds and roles on an ocean going cruise ship. The day we spent with Captain Michalis and his crew was memorable and a lot of fun. We don't get that much time off and this trip was really worth it. The vessel was comortable, stable and roomy for all of us. The seafood - harvested from the days catch - was of a wide variety and beautifully prepared for us. We were met at the harbour and brought to the boat so most of our time was on board. I would certainly reccomend this activity to anyone interested in the Sea and it's bounties and the fishermans way of life.",Date of experience: October 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
