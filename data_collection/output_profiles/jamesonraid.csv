Lovely stay,"I can’t really say enough to recommend this place, attentive staff, amazing location overlooking st Angelo, and the nicest family running it, we didn’t need anything extra, but I imagine if we did, they would provide, the restaurant is the best location in the area, with amazing views, after a few days here we realised we should just eat here, loved it and peaceful!",Date of stay: June 2019,Hotel Villa Sirena,4,"Isola d'Ischia, Italy"

Great day out on the river,"We chartered the boat for a day fishing up the mangroves. Martin was very hospitable, we had beers, lovely local food, saw a lot of the local country side, and caught a lovely fish. Every effort was made to make us feel comfortable, and the equipment was top notch, being a fisherman myself I could see that. Martins local knowledge was great, overall a great day out. They organised our transport as well. Also very good value for money with a boat well equipped for what was needed, good luck with the new venture guys!",Date of experience: February 2019,Goa Fishing Adventures,4,"Sinquerim, India"

Fantastic family run hotel,"We stayed here for 12 nights, it’s very good value in a peaceful setting, the staff couldn’t do more to help you. And the pool bar staff are great fun,also great food and cocktails, will definitely be back.",Date of stay: June 2018,Futura Hotel,4,"Crete, Greece"
Great meal,"Run by an actual italian , they have a proper wood fired oven, the pizzas are the best we’ve had in The Gambia with a great choice of toppings. I would highly recommend this place.",Date of visit: March 2018,Paolo's Restaurant Italian Pizzeria,4,"Kololi, Gambia"
Luxury and peaceful break,"Stayed here for the first time for 10 nights in January after 5 visits, I must say this is the best holiday yet. Small boutique hotel on the beach, rooms are a high standard, food too, the owner sainey couldn’t do more to make your visit, anything you need the staff will make an effort to help. Bijilo has become a great area to holiday in The Gambia, the beaches are still quiet, but there are good beach bars close by to visit, with little hassle. I would highly recommend and will return soon!",Date of stay: April 2018,Swiss Boutique Hotel,4,"Serekunda, Gambia"
Less and less toppings!,"Nice staff, but over time I've noticed you get less and less toppings to the point that it's such bad value even with a discount voucher it's not good value, so if there's open tables at another pizzeria I would rather go there.",Date of visit: June 2017,Pizza Express,4,"Inverness, United Kingdom"
Great little hotel,"Stayed for two weeks in September. And it's what you'd expect from a small family run hotel, friendly staff, quiet and relaxing, and close enough to Katelios to wander to the beach or a bite to eat. A nice bar and pool area, with what you would need for a relaxing day in the sun around the pool, not to the standard of a larger 5 star hotel, but then it's not what it is.",Date of stay: September 2016,Alkioni Hotel,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great day out!,"What a great day out with Dimitrios and Efi, they were such warm hosts, and couldn't do enough for us. It was really interesting and fun to see the catch brought in, and help the fisherman. Then while the catch was being prepared we visited private beaches, and even had a clay mask treatment with cephalonias, renowned nutrient rich clay. Then onto an amazing lunch of various fish caught that day, the freshest you can get, including cuttlefish, Greek style. Nearly all the ingredients including homemade wine and lemonade are grown organically on their small farm, which made for great fresh salads. It was a really fun day out, and a great way to experience Greek hospitality at its best.",Date of experience: September 2016,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great cheese wine and sherry!,"Great place to sit and have a few glasses of wine and great cheese tapas, staff are brilliant in explaining all the wines etc.",Date of visit: May 2016,La Solera,4,"Conil de la Frontera, Spain"
Great stay,"Nice peaceful hotel, in a good location, friendly helpful staff, own beach, nice
gardens, there's also a small shop for any extras required. Rooms are fine, good to get mosquito nets as they do help with bites at night, I've booked again for December!",Date of stay: March 2015,Lemon Creek Hotel Resort,4,"Bijilo, Gambia"
