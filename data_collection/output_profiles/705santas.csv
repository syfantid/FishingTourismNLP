Bad Expierence,"Unfortunately i have to leave a bad review for this experience. First bad review i have ever written!
Based on the great reviews on Tripadvisor , i have booked this experience as a part of my & husbands Wedding Anniversary South of France Road trip - as a highlight of the trip.
Before i booked this , i have noticed that the same Person-Bertrand offers multiple tours in same day and some of them even clash .For example ours was at 5pm and supposed to be few hours ,but then there was another one @ 3pm for few hours and also more in the same day. Initially i assumed they will be hosted by different people. Even though all the reviews i saw ,mentioned just Bertrand.
So i booked this and later on got a confirmation that this is available and it's booked.
That was two weeks before the trip.
So day before the actual tour ,i got a message from Bertrand saying that can we change it for the next day because of his ""another job"" ! I replied that unfortunately it wouldn't be possible because we are in Montpellier just for one night because we are on the road trip! He just said he can't because of the problem with another work. When i explained the situation to him again, he wouldn't respond anymore. I had a look on tripadvisor again(on Viator on also other websites) , and can see there are a lot of tours he offers on the same day ! I have asked this to him-does he just trying to maximise his chances of bookings and then just moving them all to one ?As it looked like that IS his another job .He didn't respond. I tried to call-no answer.I have cancelled just to make sure i get a refund.

I do understand that things happen and i would normally accept this as just part of life situation. But seeing that this same person hosts multiple tours in the same time is just ridiculous! Also trying to change it on the day before when we had no chance to rebook it with someone else! And no proper communication or even apology of the cancellation.
Maybe i'm the only one who experienced this, i don't know.
So yeah ,thanks Bertrand for ruining most important part of our trip!",Date of experience: August 2020,Pic Saint Loup Winetour & food,1,"Montpellier, France"

Tasty food &great service,"Me and my husband visited Les Fortes Tetes on Sunday evening.
We were served by very nice lady who also could speak a very good English which was very helpful when ordering food/drinks.
She was very helpful with choosing wine and after my husband described what sort of wine/taste we would like , she said she knows exactly what we want and delivered bottle of very tasty wine!
My husband ordered a starter which was very tasty !
For the mains we had a steak & a burger. Both very delicious and cooked exactly how requested. Food was very fresh .And fried potatoes were super delicious!
Overall great experience and would definitely recommend!",Date of visit: August 2020,Les Fortes Têtes,1,"Toulouse, France"
Amazing Lunch,"Booked a table here for steaks over lunch on Friday. Service was excellent and they had organised a nice table for us outside. All covid measures were dealt with efficiently including the optional digital menu via a QR code. Our waitress was very attentive and ensured we had everything we needed. The food was excellent, fresh and super tasty and the portion sizes were perfect. I ordered the fillet steak and my husband had the Angus sirloin, my father in law had the pork chop and my mother in law had the rack of lamb. All were cooked exactly to our liking so can't fault it.My steak was fantastic! Excellent quality and cooked to perfection!
Desserts were great too!We will definitely be back for more !",Date of visit: June 2020,Faaron Steakhouse,1,"Faro, Portugal"
"Fantastic Food, Experience and People!","Firstly, this is possibly the best excursion we have been on while travelling around Europe. Having never been on a fishing boat before we didn't know what to expect but from the moment we booked through to the end of the trip we were looked after extremely well by Antonia. Antonia ensured our arrival to the boat was handled and even picked us up from our hotel. Heading out in the early morning was made much more manageable by the delicious home baked cake and coffee on arrival. As the trip progressed Antonia educated us on the profession of fishing and each stage of the process as the nets were reeled in and the fish collected. We then moored up in a beautiful bay near the south of the island with a glass of wine from the family vineyard and the chance to swim in the bay. The water was so clear and fresh with no one else in sight. Over the next hour or so smells started to stir from the kitchen as the best meal we had in Greece was produced. Nothing beats direct from the sea and into the pan! We all sat down to eat together and I have to say the food was some of the best I have ever had. Every ingredient was locally produced by various members of the family and the tastes were sensational. Overall I would highly recommend this experience to anyone who wants to board an elegant boat, head out to sea and experience the highs of having your dinner caught and cooked for you.",Date of experience: April 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
What a Great Little Find,"We visited Alexander The Great for a pre-show dinner for my wife's birthday. What a great little place! The staff were warm and welcoming and the variety of food was plentiful, fresh and delicious. My wife and i both had lamb and our two friends who joined us shared the hot and cold mezze. The variety and portions included in the mezze were impressive and each dish was exceptional. Andy made us feel very welcome and sorted a special birthday baklava along with some Limoncello to celebrate my wife's birthday. Would definitely recommend this restaurant and will be back.",Date of visit: October 2018,Alexander The Great,1,"London, United Kingdom"
