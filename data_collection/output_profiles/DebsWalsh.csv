Super service!,"Excellent and reliable service - would definitely use again! Easy to book and very professional.
10/10 - thank you",Date of experience: August 2019,Kefalonia Taxi Service,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Superb - 10/10!,"My family had the best experience on Dimitrios and Efiâ€™s fishing boat out of Katelios. It was an absolute amazing trip and such an education for all ages!
You can be hands on and get involved in untangling the fish from the nets, learning about all the different types of fish or sit back and enjoy the friendly atmosphere. Efi cooks a fabulous ocean to table dining experience which is simply delicious and the homemade wine is a real treat too! We also enjoyed a couple of swims along the way. Efi and Dimitrios are very welcoming and lovely hosts who go out of their way to make you happy. The other guests on the boat were so friendly and this trip was the highlight of our holiday - 10/10!
Big thanks to the crew - we had a superb day and the memories will stay with us for ever xx",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Superb - 10/10!,"From the minute we arrived we were made to feel very welcome. Lovorka had arranged a taxi transfer for us and provided walking instructions which made this part of our journey very easy.

The location was fantastic and exceptionally picturesque. We virtually had the whole bay to ourselves and loved the peace and quiet - it was very safe for our 14 and 10 year old! The two restaurants within 2 mins of the villa were great and the campsite a further 10 mins was a useful addition.

Hvar was easily accessible by the shuttle bus from the campsite and taxi from the villa. Lovorka provided us with lots of useful information and advice. Nothing was too much trouble for her, we really did feel part of the family!

The sea view villa had stunning views, was well furnished and immaculate. All in all a superb holiday, rated as one of the best by the whole family.

Hoping to revisit at some stage - thanks Lovorka and family :-)",Date of stay: August 2016,Top Seaview Apartment,4,"Hvar Island, Croatia"
A lovely 2 night stay in Hartington,"David the owner, was very welcoming, friendly and was a great host with nothing being too much trouble. He provided us with tea and coffee delivered to the rooms in the morning and provided a late night coffee along with ice for whisky (we had brought this along)! The breakfast was excellent with bacon, sausage, eggs - the full works, all produced and bought locally. The 'breakfast trifle' fruit compote - was lovely but quite an adult taste! David provided us with maps for our walks and afternoon tea and biscuits. The accommodation was quirky but tastefully done and the property is really handy for the pubs, local attractions and fabulous walks. Very worth a visit and very worth a stay at Parsons House. Thanks David you were great!",Date of stay: April 2016,Parsons House B&B,4,"Hartington, United Kingdom"
