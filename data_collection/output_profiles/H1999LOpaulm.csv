Brilliant day out. We highly recommend it,"We had a fantastic day out today. The captain was such a great host and chef, he was very good fun too. He taught my girlfriend how to fish for the first time and we both caught a lot of fish. We stopped for a swim and snorkel whilst he prepared the food which was amazing. It was worth the price for the food alone and we both enjoyed the beer.

We would both highly recommend it to anyone as the captain was so accommodating. My partner does not like eating fish or fishing but still really enjoyed the trip and food and said it was the highlight of our holiday so far. We will definitely be back.

Thank you
