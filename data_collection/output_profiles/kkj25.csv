Brilliant !,"Great value for money. We paid 45euros each, which included around 3 hours of fishing, time to swim in the sea and a fish lunch cooked on the BBQ. We had the boat to ourselves (5 family members along with the captain), which was a great experience. The only down side was that the boat was very small (I’d say no more than 8 people would fit) and I was hoping we would taste some of the fish we caught. Other than that it was a brilliant day out with a very helpful captain.

Consistently excellent,I have visited Summer Palace a few times and I can not fault it! The food is delicious and the staff are friendly! It’s a little pricier than most but worth every penny! Would highly recommend.,Date of visit: May 2019,Summer Palace,4,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"

Not a 5 star more of a 3 star!,"Just recently visited this hotel for a family holiday of 5. Initial thoughts were great. Lovely reception/pool area and lovely hotel grounds. Location is good as the hotel is right on the beach front and is in walking distance to shops and restaurants (would still recommend getting a car hire).

......now onto the disappointing parts.

Rooms - Standard rooms are outdated and dark. As soon as we arrived I noticed one of our rooms had dead ants on the bathroom window and in the bath. After being cleaned many times the ants kept appearing from a crack in the bathroom window which took numerous complaints to resolve. In the end we contacted British airways (who were outstandingly helpful) to which they phoned the hotel and got the matter resolved. Our other room was a suite which was kindly upgraded for free, which consisted of 3 adults sharing. However the maids did not cater to this and never supplied enough water or coffee even though this was specified. The room was facing the pool and beach with a lovely balcony view, however the evenings entertainment (live music) was based just below which we were not informed. Music would play from around 9pm to 11.30pm almost every night. If your not one for late nights this is something to bare in mind if you do visit as I found it impossible to sleep whilst the music was playing!

Food - The food was ok, basic and not much selection. The hot grill was great, however ran out very quickly. The organisation was terrible and chaotic. There was never a table big enough for us meaning we had to wait for a table to be made on every sitting which was annoying.

Staff - The staff were rude and not friendly. It was hard work to try and order drinks during dinner service. Staff would not come out of their way to serve you. One of the kitchen staff members kept looking at women inappropriately whilst working dinner service which was very unprofessional and uncomfortable to see!

Spa - The deco was nice, however treatments were expensive. The sauna and steam room did not work during our stay.

Maintenance - The overall maintenance for appliances and equipment inside the hotel was not well kept e.g fittings/fixtures and deco poorly adhered to.

As an overall our stay was ok but I would not return back to this hotel or recommend it as a 5 star stay.",Date of stay: May 2019,The Ixian Grand,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
