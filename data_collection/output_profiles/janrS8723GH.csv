"Wonderful, traditional village taverna in beautifully sleepy Zola.","I can't tell you much because I don't want lots of people to go there and spoil it all. But, to be fair to the taverna and for business I need to be less selfish!
I love this warm, welcoming taverna and the food is simple but delicious. The service is very efficient and perfectly friendly and helpful. In fact, you are all so welcoming we feel like firm friends every time and year we visit!
We enjoyed another year of great food, drink and memories at Stou Tsagkari. Efharisto kai 'diolch'. :) Hope to see you again soon.

"Great day out, lovely people and memories for some time to come.","Superb and chilled out. Adventures to secluded beaches, caves and underwater caverns. Jumping from seriously big boulders into perfectly blue waters. Watching the 'catch' reeled in - fascinating and hypnotic! The guys are so accommodating and friendly - I hope this continues to be such a success for you both, K&D.
Thanks for the best day. x",Date of experience: August 2019,Kefalonia Fishing Tours,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Stunning,I'm not saying any more because everyone will come! But this place is still a relative sanctuary for such a large beach on a big island. That's all you're getting!,Date of experience: August 2019,Agia Kyriaki Beach,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
So lovely to be back this month!,"Always excellent service, delicious meals and friendly and laid back atmosphere. We made the effort to drive 1/2 hour from where we were staying this year again, just to say 'hi' and enjoy. This is not only a convenient place to eat after a day at the famous Myrtos beach but the variety, good quality and tasty food is worth paying a visit for. We tend to avoid Myrtos at this time of year, but if passing through Divarata village or staying nearby the taverna is well worth a visit.
Many thanks to Anastasia and the team as always.",Date of visit: August 2019,Myrtos Taverna,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Bendigedig!,"We have been visiting The Ship for well over 25 years. It's a lovely friendly hotel catering for locals and visitors. Very unpretentious, welcoming atmosphere and great food. The hanging kebab was delicious! Thanks Alun and team for everything",Date of stay: April 2019,The Ship Hotel,4,"Aberdaron, United Kingdom"
Love it here,"Many thanks. Excellent simple food and cosy atmosphere. Friendly and welcoming. We have enjoyed every visit in our 3 week stay. Lovely chatting with you too, Sophia.",Date of visit: August 2017,Tsovolas Grill House,4,"Meganisi, Greece"
"Child away, adults out to play (on a monday!).",Great bit of food tonight - only had starters and sides but there's a new menu and things are looking good. We are locals but havent been for a while but the food is much better than it was for a while - just from tonight's experience anyway. Lovely night to sit outside and staff were friendly and attentive. Good on you Tyn. . Thanks all. X,Date of visit: June 2017,Tyn y Capel Inn & Restaurant,4,"Minera, United Kingdom"
Excellent is an understatement!,"Superb visit over new year. Stunning 'Residence' lodge with hot tub. Excellent customer service and delicious food and friendly service at the onsite restaurant 'The Terrace'.
We don't tend to take 'resort' breaks but wouldn't hesitate to book here again. This was also a great base location to explore much of Cornwall.
Many thanks to the team!",Date of stay: December 2016,Landal Gwel an Mor,4,"Portreath, United Kingdom"
Delicious!,"Delicious food, friendly service and relaxing atmosphere. Thanks to all for two lovely evenings spent at The Terrace (Dec/Jan).",Date of visit: December 2016,The Terrace Bar & Restaurant,4,"Portreath, United Kingdom"
Enjoyed our visit,"Much improved setting and food of late and we had a lovely meal there last week. Good choice on the menu. Only let down was the very long wait for our meals and it wasn't particularly busy. My son's burger was a little dry, perhaps because of this delay, however, the casserole, steak and lamb dishes that we had were beautiful and have therefore earned The Beeches an extra point from me! Staff were very friendly and helpful.",Date of visit: November 2016,The Beeches,4,"Gresford, United Kingdom"
Great pub - dining by the river :),"The Grouse is an unspoilt old village pub with a cosy atmosphere inside and superb views of the river Dee and the Dee valley and hills outside. We regularly visit all year 'round for the tasty, great value, home cooked meals or to simply enjoy a glass of wine out on the terrace watching the river swoosh by and listening to the occasional chugs and whistles as the steam trains approach nearby Carrog station. It is popular on summer weekends in particular but there's usually room for everyone. Staff are friendly and efficient and the food is plentiful, nicely cooked and presented. Thanks to The Grouse for many happy visits!",Date of visit: October 2016,The Grouse Inn,4,"Carrog, United Kingdom"
Lovely little villa in convenient location,"We recently stayed in Villa Ianthe for three weeks and had a very relaxing holiday. many thanks to the owners and to Anna who was always on hand if needed - however there was nothing to need!
The 2 bedroom villa was very clean, well-appointed and comfortable with a pretty little garden and pool to keep us cool, various areas to sit and relax and everything else was spot on for our stay. The plants and trees gave good privacy and were well-tended. the only thing we could say was that the tall fir trees could do with a trim as they were casting shade over the pool meaning it remained on the cool side, however this was not a huge problem for us!
The village is small and traditional with a local taverna in easy walking distance and only 5 minutes from Agia Efimia in one direction (with a good selection of shops and tavernas) and Myrtos/Divarata 5 minutes in the other direction (Myrtos taverna here was also a favourite). Conveniently positioned to explore the north, even with the coast road still closed. easy driving distance to the airport, Argostoli and Lixouri as well as the east, e.g. Sami.
I would not hesitate to book the villa again if we return to this part of the island and would reiterate our many thanks for helping to make our holiday so fabulous with your lovely villa.

"Tasty meals and friendly, prompt service",We ate here several times in a recent 3 week stay in the area. Enjoyed the variety on the menu and all was cooked beautifully. From fresh fish (my son's favourite) to BBQ ribs (my husband says the best he's ever tasted!) and much in-between - traditional and otherwise. Staff were friendly and helpful as well as professional. Many thanks from the three of us and hope to visit again.,Date of visit: August 2016,The Local,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Very good, professional service",Excellent day out. The team at Yellow Boats are helpful and professional and the boats are modern and well-maintained. Instruction was helpful also. A really enjoyable day. Many thanks!,Date of experience: August 2016,Yellow Boats Kefalonia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely taverna. Lovely people.,"We have been staying in the area for 3 weeks and have visited the taverna several times. Just want to thank Anastasia and all for the wonderfull food and hospitality. Looking forward to a return visit next year and to meeting these lovely people again. Food is very tasty, fresh and very reasonably priced. Well worth coming whether you are going to the beach or not. Many, many thanks for our lovely meals and have really enjoyed chatting with you Annastasia. Will keep in touch.

"Very good value, lovely room and tasty food!",Stayed overnight in February. Really good choice and nicely situated for all the local attractions. We were given a really warm welcome and the room was cosy and very comfortable. We enjoyed dinner and a lovely breakfast in the sunny conservatory the following morning. Great little inn - we would definitely stay there again. Many thanks!,Date of stay: February 2016,Shakespeare Inn,4,"Telford, United Kingdom"
Two visits in 1 week!,"Staying in the area at new year, my husband and I had a such a fab meal on our visit that we returned a couple of days later with my Mum and my son as we knew they'd love it. On both occasions the food was lovely and the staff were friendly an efficient. Nothing too much trouble. It's not Michelin star, indeed, but they do what they do exceptionally well and is excellent value. Brilliant job all - cheers to your continued success.
By the way - the puds were also to die for!!!",Date of visit: December 2015,The Kookaba,4,"Saundersfoot, United Kingdom"
Enjoyed a warm welcome in December,"Enjoyed the food and welcome here on a winter break. Staff were friendly and helpful. There was good choice on the menu and we all enjoyed our meals. Nice area outside, even managed a drink overlooking the sea in-between rain torrents! Would be advisable to book in the summer, I should think.",Date of visit: December 2015,Wiseman's Bridge Inn Restaurant,4,"Wiseman's Bridge, United Kingdom"
Very tasty!,Popped in last Friday and couldn't fault the delicious meal and friendly service. I can't think why we've left it so long since our last visit! The outside area is looking lovely too - fingers crossed for a few sunny warm evenings to be able to make the most of it in the coming months. We'll be back very soon. Many thanks!,Date of visit: April 2016,The Ship,4,"Llanbedrog, United Kingdom"
Disappointed.,"Have returned to this pub over and over due to prompt service and pleasant setting. The food is simple pub grub (if a little pricey for its type) and, bearing this in mind, we have had no problems with it on the whole. However, on recent visits we have been disappointed with, amongst other things, bland burgers and microwaved peas, I'm sorry to say - and wish that I didn't need to.
Come on 'The Glyn', you are a popular pub with local and visitors alike and it's a lovely place to be. Please give us the quality and taste that we're paying for.",Date of visit: April 2016,Glyn y Weddw Arms,4,"Llanbedrog, United Kingdom"
Really great pub food,"We regularly visit, bypassing closer places to eat as we've never had a bad meal here. Pub favourites with added locally sourced fresh seafood and some unusual additions on occasions, different for a country pub.
Yes it gets very busy and, at these times, you may need to wait for a table as you generally can't book, however, if prepared for this, it's rarely a long wait and there's a good system in place to ensure people are catered for.
I can thoroughly recommend the steak!
We've always found John and Vivien to be very welcoming and all the staff too. One of the best places of its kind in the area.",Date of visit: April 2016,The Sun,4,"Llanengan, United Kingdom"
Great little villa in a quiet village - a haven in August,"Many thanks for our lovely stay last year. The villa had everything we needed and a super pool and outside area with beautiful views of the sea and mountains. We couldn't fault the facilities in the villa and everything was well thought out. The only thing that we would have added would be some additional comfy seating outside and parasols for portable shade to make the most of the sea view. The music system was a real bonus though.
Zola is a pretty little village and we made the most of the little taverna in the village, which served delicious food - very traditional and the small menu was enough to keep us very happy on several occasions and within easy walking distance up the hill. The family there were very welcoming and there was lovely live music on a couple of evenings. There are a few other tavernas in the area, but further to walk or a short drive. Lixouri and Agia Eimia have a wider range of restaurants 20-30 minutes drive away.
The local beaches were super - Ag. Kyriaki (can be seen from the villa) was surprisingly un-crowded for August and Vouti (local beach) was brilliant and really quiet. There's a small taverna, fish taverna and bar at the former and a beach cantina at the latter. We also hired a boat to explore the wonderful coast and coves here.
Returning to the villa - our three weeks were superbly relaxing and we have fabulous memories of the villa and the area. We wouldn't hesitate to book again on our next visit to this little corner of the island.
Many thanks again to Paul and all in Kefalonia.",Date of stay: August 2015,Villa Midas,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely family taverna,"Wonderfully friendly, family taverna - thoroughly recommended. Efvie's ""yiamistes"" (stuffed peppers and tomatoes) are just the best! Can't wait for another visit soon.",Date of visit: August 2015,Rose Garden Taverna,4,"Meganisi, Greece"
A great family taverna by the sea.,Super family taverna. Very good service and traditional food. Another lovely family from this friendly island. We'll be back soon. My son particularly recommends the simple but tasty fish - he developed his love of fresh fish here on the island and he's still only 9 years old! See you again soon!,Date of visit: August 2015,O Stavros,4,"Meganisi, Greece"
Picturesque setting and a really hard-working team.,"Away from the main villages and popular with flotillas, you'd be hard-pressed to meet a harder working bunch of guys than at Niagas. The food is really good too, by the way! Simple and fresh and very tasty. There's a fab atmosphere on occasional nights when the traditional music starts, on quieter evenings simply eating and drinking in this lovely area of the island is wonderful. See you again soon.",Date of visit: August 2015,Niagas Restaurant,4,"Meganisi, Greece"
