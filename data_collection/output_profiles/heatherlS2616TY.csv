Perfect Day out,"So glad we did this - it was a bunch of six of us and we loved every minute. Effi and Dimitri were so kind and welcoming and we felt right at home. It was a great mixture of seeing the fish in the morning and then travelling around some beautiful islands and beaches that we would have never found on our own.

The lunch Effi cooked for us on the boat was out of this world and their homemade wine was delicious as well!

Couldnt recommend this more strongly!",Date of experience: July 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
