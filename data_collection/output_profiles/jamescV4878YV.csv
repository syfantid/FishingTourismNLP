"Very enjoyable trip, well worth the price","We were taken to a variety of different swimming spots around the island of polyaigos, including a couple with caves to explore.

The pace of the trip was great and gave us plenty of time to relax and take in the sights of polyaigos.

Nikos and Froso were happy to chat around the history of the island and overall provided a great service.

We would absolutely recommend this trip to anyone visiting Kimilos.",Date of experience: August 2019,Milos Fishing Experience,5,"Milos, Greece"
