Best day of our cruise!,We stopped here on a 7-day cruise. My brother-in-law found this fishing excursion and it turned out to be our best day. Yanks and Maria could not have been more accommodating. We saw sea turtles aboard a great boat. We went to a private beach where they provided snorkels for us to explore. While we played on the beach they prepared a feast from fish that was caught that day! It was incredible. Thank you Captain and Maria for a day we will never forget!,Date of experience: June 2019,Poseidon Fishing Tourism Kefalonia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best way to start Dubrovnik!,"Our tour guide, Milka, was amazing. She grew up in the city and therefore had incredible knowledge of it’s history. She was funny and engaging. It was a very hot day, so she kept us in the shade as much as possible. The headphones provided insured we didn’t miss a thing, even when my six-year-old wandered off to pet the cats!",Date of experience: June 2019,Dubrovnik Walking Tours,4,"Dubrovnik, Croatia"
