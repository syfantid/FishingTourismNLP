Highly recommended!!!!,"The hotel situated in the center of Gereme. Very close to the promenade street. Only 1 km to the Open air museum Gereme. Under fairy chimneys. With fantastic views from the roof of the hotel to the city. We spent in this hotel 3 amazing days. Very cozy place. The staff extremely friendly and helpful. The owner, James, make everything that you can fill like home and have a magic vacation!!!! He is professional pilot of the hotair balloon, company ""Voyagerballons"". We flight on the balloon early in the morning, it was like fairy dreams!!!!
