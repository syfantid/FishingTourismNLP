Fishing and Sunset,"Captain Nick and his ""mate"" were very obliging, knowlegeble and were very pleasant to be with on the boat. From the moment we met them, to the time we left we were at ease and informed of everything. I fished, did nt catch anything to mention!! But then it was in the middle of the day and was nt really expecting to. We snorkelled, went to the warm springs and ate on the boat. Nick had caught a fish first thing in the morning which was lovely - as were the salads and accompaniments. To see the sunset from the boat is different and truly lovely.

The trip was not cheap, but I would suggest anyone took the trip.",Date of experience: July 2018,Santorini Fishing Trips,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Lovely beach,"the ""cliff"", if that is what you can call it was made of either compressed sand, or sandstone, and over the years the weather has carved itself into the face leaving it with random shapes and lines - it was beautiful.

The beach did have several people on it, but was far from being crowded. There is a short walk to go past the unbrellas etc, then there is an expanse of beach!",Date of experience: July 2018,Vlychada Beach,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Perfect,"Our room was exactly as described, and clean. When we arrived we were greeted by a local young lady who could not be more helpful. As I understand it there are two young ladies that work in ""reception"" and both were as good as each other. You have to let them know what you would like for breakfast, and at what time and it is delivered to your room. We always got what we ordered and at the right time!

I do not have anything negative to say about our room or the service we received. Perhaps, the telegraph pole on the track at the rear of the suites got in the way of our photos of the sun set! But if that is all there is to complain about...…..",Date of stay: July 2018,May Seven Suites - Adults Only,4,"Santorini, Greece"
"We Waited, waited and waited some more then..........the food was not good","My wife and I took my mother out the Saturday before Mothering Sunday to have lunch. We were very disappointed by the service... My wife had phoned up the day to make a reservation and the earliest we were offered was 1.30 pm - so we rightly assumed that it was going to be fairly busy.

We arrived at 1.20 pm and were nicely greeted and shown to a table, and some minutes later offered a drink and given menus - then we waited for a very long time to receive the drinks, expecting the person to drop their tray off and return to take our order! Then at least 10 minutes later I had to ask for the young lady to take our order. This was done well, but it was obvious the young lady was new and was not familiar with everything, as someone else returned to confirm our order (which incidently had been taken correctly). We only ordered main courses!

Again, we waited and waited - I do not know how long but it was extremely excessive. Between us we ordered two different salmon dishes (one from the main menu and the other from the ""blackboard"". Mine was with an asparagus and king prawn risotto - the salmon was nicely cooked, the risotto on the otherhand was very wet and dosed to an extent making it all but inedible with pepper. The other salmon dish was with pak choi, which you might have doubted as to whether it had been drained (it was so wet it spoiled other parts of the dish).

Sometime after we had finished our food we thought the waitress was coming to clear our plates away, but no she had come to clear a table right next to us - at this point my wife asked her to clear our plates informing her that we had been waiting a long time. The waitress cleared 2 of the plates and disappeared as she had been asked to do something else by a more senior person!

At this point I asked for the bill as it was 3.35 pm (two and a quarter hours after arriving and only having a main course) - it did not arrive - so I went to complain and pay! The lady who I asked was pulled away by a man (who appeared to be in charge, hiding behind the bar) and I remonstrated to him about the length of time it had taken to eat a main course, and explained that my dish was all but inedible. I am afraid to say that whilst he was apologising he did not seem to care at all - blaming the situation on the good weather on everyone visiting them, and a member of staff not turning up. I am sorry.... but the weather forecast for that day was showing as being good all week, and one member of staff would have helped but two would have been more adequate.

In a nutshell the service was almost non existant and the food was poor - I would not recommend going, and will not be returning.",Date of visit: March 2019,The Ragged Cot Restaurant,4,"Minchinhampton, United Kingdom"
Lovely home cooked food,"I ate the faggots. You don't see them everywhere, so it was quite a treat! Was able to sit outside on a lovely evening! Lovely!",Date of visit: July 2017,The Twelve Bells Pub and Restaurant,4,"Cirencester, United Kingdom"
Okay!,"We have been going to the Sultan for a couple of years on a regular basis. It may be that it has changed, but for us it is not what it used to be! The last meal we had was not as good and the service was not as genuine, still good, and for us as we were always recognised not as personal.",Date of visit: June 2017,Sultan,4,"Cirencester, United Kingdom"
"Nice Location, lovely place , food average","The location is great for us, as we live locally and like to cycle around. The Old Boathouse allows us to refresh on our journey! The service each time we have been there is nowhere near as quick as it could be, and the food,I think, is average. It is lovely to sit out at the back by the lake, which in my mind is stunning.",Date of visit: June 2017,The Old Boathouse,4,"South Cerney, United Kingdom"
A lovely stay and great meal,"Our room was nice despite hoping for a sea view and overlooking the road (we did book late and did not ask!). We had dinner which was really very good, breakfast the following morning was excellent and being able to sit outside was a real bonus. The weather was lovely as was the view across the sea.",Date of stay: July 2016,Pebble Beach Rooms,4,"Barton-on-Sea, United Kingdom"
Nice Place,"Our room was on the third floor, and despite the weather being very hot the room maintained a comfortable temperature. All of the windows opened and, probably being quite high up allowed for a good air movement. The room was comfortable, as was the bed, the bathroom had all of the things that you would expect. We joined some friends at a private luncheon - the food was average, nothing to complain about but was not exceptional. Breakfast was okay as well!",Date of stay: July 2016,The Kings Arms Hotel,4,"Christchurch, United Kingdom"
Good Location and nice place,"We were welcomed nicely, the room was a little small - but then you get what you pay for. My wife suffers with her back, and the bed did not help her at all and she did not sleep at all well and suffered the following day. The room was very clean and the rest of the amenities left nothing to complain about except the shower was maybe not as powerful as it might have been.",Date of stay: July 2016,The Chocolate Boutique Hotel,4,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom"
Nice Stay,"I stayed here with my wife two weeks ago, and we had a good stay. The bedroom was a little smaller than I imagined it would have been, but was good and clean - so nothing to grumble about. we only had breakfast in the restaurant, which was good - I asked for my usual poached eggs and they were produced as requested - and nicely cooked too! My only grumble about the stay was that there was no where to park as there was a function taking place and all of the parking was taken. This meant parking on the road a fair distance away. The beach is a five minute walk, down the hill, which is no problem getting to - but getting back is hard work! We are going back to stay there in a couple of weeks, and would recommend the hotel.",Date of stay: June 2015,Riviera Hotel & Holiday Apartments,4,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom"
Lovely Stay,"We had a lovely stay, the weather was a little chilly, but then that is not the hotels fault. We stayed over the bank holiday weekend and were surprised that neither the bar or the restaurant were open on the Sunday evening. It does say that they are 'closed' in the bedroom literature, but we did not look as expected as it was a bank holiday that they would provide the usual service. It might have been nice to be told on check in. Our room we thought was a little expensive, but then the view was lovely all the way over to the Needles, and that has to be paid for! Breakfast was good, freshly cooked and as expected, I even had a lovely kipper! However breakfast was a little spoiled by someone vacuuming in the adjacent room, it might have helped if they could not wait to do this to shut the doors to limit the noise, it was very annoying.During the afternoons we sat outside and had a couple of drinks, where there are a couple of garden games that can help pass the time away. It was a lovely stay, if you book the sea views are lovely and I would recomend you asked for one!",Date of stay: May 2015,The Cliff House,4,"Barton-on-Sea, United Kingdom"
Good but Expensive,"We went up the Shard on a Saturday evening at 5.30 pm. The view was a little murky, but stunning all the same. The benefit from going at this time was that it was just getting dark, so we had both a daytime view and night scene to admire.

The gift shop and pictures they give you the opportunity of having taken on the way up etc are a really good ides, but at over £20 per picture seems a great deal of money to me (may be I am a little out of date) so we did not buy any. If they had been cheaper we probably would have done.

We were marshalled up and down really well and hardly had to wait at any time, very good!",Date of experience: February 2015,The View from The Shard,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Lovely Meal,We live locally and by chance had dinner at the Kings Head. The food was lovely and the service equally as good. We will be returning.,Date of visit: December 2014,Kings Head Restaurant,4,"Cirencester, United Kingdom"
Was not as good as it should have been,"My wife and I stayed in the hotel on a Saturday night when there was a wedding taking place. This was not of a real inconvenience until the evening. During the afternoon we used the gym, pool etc which was nice and as expected. After we had used the gym we went into the bar to ""re hydrate"". I am aware that the wedding guests had not long left the bar as there were glasses all over the bar, confetti on the floor and the place was a real mess. The problem for me was not the mess but the fact that no one seemed intent on cleaning the mess up, we drank our drinks outside and came in after about 30 mins to see no change! We booked for dinner, and chose from the menu and was served by good staff who appeared to genuinely care that we enjoyed our meal. My wife ate ham hock ballotine as a starter (that was not very tasty), I had whitebait (which was very good) and we both had belly pork for main course. The pork was excellent, but I did feel that there was too much grain mustard in the mashed potato (this may be personal preference. My wife had rice pudding for dessert - the rice was crunchy and very undercooked and was sent back.

Our nights sleep was disturbed by the wedding party as we overlooked the outside area where those that smoked went, and in the morning there were cigarette ends all over the place. There were no smoking signs up everywhere threatening a fine if caught - but this was not Policed and as such a waste of time with the signage.

I was a little surprised at the state of some of the doors etc, there were grubby marks on the doors and nothing seemed to feel that clean, I may be being a little over the top, but that is how it felt.",Date of stay: September 2014,DoubleTree by Hilton Bristol South - Cadbury House,4,"Congresbury, United Kingdom"
Not as we imagined!,"I stayed with my wife recently, and we were quite disappointed. The room was in need of a lick of paint in lots of places, the bed was very comfortable, but the shower suffered from a distinct lack of pressure and did not work properly. We ate each evening of our stay and on the second evening had to wait nearly an hour for our food. Breakfast was not consistent and for the price paid we were surprised to have a choice of three basic cereals served in a ""Tupperware"" type container, the poached eggs we were served were not cooked properly and looked decidedly strange, which was surprising as we waited over 45 minutes for them! During breakfast on our first nights stay the owner asked his children to come into the area we were eating to 'swat the flies' and ran around all over the place whilst we were eating, the lady serving breakfast, who was very friendly even had to tell them to stop ""playing"" the piano! During our second night the fire alarm sounded in the middle of the night, whilst it is re assuring to know it works, it would have been nice if there had been some recognition that it had disturbed our nights sleep! All in all I would not stay again especially at the rates we paid.",Date of stay: July 2014,The Scott Arms,4,"Corfe Castle, United Kingdom"
"Food good, service not so good","The venue is beside one of the lakes, and whist eating you can watch the water skiing/boarding etc, which is quite novel to watch. When we arrived we had booked a table as it was a Saturday, the young lady who showed us to the table was very good. However the remainder of the service staff did not appear to know what they were doing. It seemed to take an age for someone to take our order and then when the cutlery was brought the waitress had blacked chipped nail varnish and writing on the back of her hand, she dropped the cutlery on the grass (as we were sitting outside). The food came quickly, but was offered to a different table first! We had ordered Scampi and chips, which was as expected, a burger and chips - which was rare in the middle!! and a Caesar salad - which again was fine.",Date of visit: May 2014,Lakeside Restaurant,4,"South Cerney, United Kingdom"
Lovely location let down by food and slow service,"Living locally we have been to the Boathouse a couple of times, always finding it to be ok! But recently we went and the meal we had was very poor. My wife had mussels to start followed by a burger and chips. The burger and the chips were cold. I had a Caesar salad to start, which was as expected, and a main course size mussel frites. The mussels I had as a main course were not hot, and although cooked, had not been coked very well and the dish size appeared the same size as my wife had as a starter for more money! The service was slow. There had been a large group who arrived just before we did that I think made us victims of having to wait and have spoilt food",Date of visit: April 2014,The Old Boathouse,4,"South Cerney, United Kingdom"
Lovely Meal - again,"I am a big fan, I have eaten here several times, and when my wife and I fancy an Indian meal we, almost without fail, go here. I would recommend the food and the staff. I have never had a bad meal here",Date of visit: March 2014,Maharajah Tandoori,4,"Rugby, United Kingdom"
A nice nights stay,"We decided to go away for a nights stay on the coast. Our room was lovely and clean, with a good shower room. The view from our room over looked Chesil Beach and on to the sea. The view was lovely, helped by a sunny day. Breakfast was nicely cooked with the option of chicken or duck eggs, needless to say they were lovely. Only one point of negativity was that the house was not sound proofed at all well. We could here others conversations, which did not really disturb us, but was a little annoying",Date of stay: February 2014,Swallows Rest,4,"Weymouth, United Kingdom"
Nice Meal,"my wife and i joined up with some friends for dinner. The food was really excellent with us having a range of dishes. I would, on the quality of the food have given an excellent mark, but the waiter was very brusque and not very friendly at all.",Date of visit: October 2013,Maharajah Tandoori,4,"Rugby, United Kingdom"
Excellent Breakfast,"We called in one Sunday morning for breakfast as could not find anywhere open, as we had been up early and were passing through. The food and service were excellent - would certainly do it again! The hotel looked nice to boot - so maybe instead of getting up early to travel we may well go and break the journey and stay!",Date of stay: October 2013,Redesdale Arms Hotel,4,"Moreton-in-Marsh, United Kingdom"
Nice Meal,"We live fairly local to The Crown, and as the fridge was bare popped out for something to eat. My main dish of Calve Liver was good, and my wife's dish of fish and chips was also well cooked. All of the staff that we came across were not of British origin, but were all very welcoming and attentive. The only point of criticism was that the Guinness I drank was not the best ""pint"" I have ever had - and to be honest was not good at all. All in all, I would go back again.",,The Bar at The Crown of Crucis,4,"Ampney Crucis, United Kingdom"
Lovely place to stop whilst walking the coast,"We came across the tearooms whilst walking the coast and stooped for a bite to eat. You can eat either in or outside, and being a reformed smoker (I think we are the worst) was refreshed to see that they do not allow people to smoke outside! We ate a ploughman s, Brie and cranberry baguette and a cheese and ham toastie. Simple yes, but all freshly made and faultless. If you are walking, or travelling close by it is well worth popping in for a light lunch.",Date of visit: August 2013,Coastguards Tea Rooms,4,"Hastings, United Kingdom"
A good fun day out,"We, like lots of families, have been to lots of theme parks. We went to Thorpe Park and had a good day, the weather was good and the park not too busy so went on lots of rides. The downside was that there appeared to be a shortage of staff and bins were full to overflowing, having a bad allergy to wasp stings I was jumping around all over the place avoiding them. It was not good to see all of the bins overflowing, and the free for all system when leaving the car park is not good either, I am sure if there had been a few car parking marshals it would have been quicker.",Date of experience: August 2013,Thorpe Park,4,"Chertsey, United Kingdom"
Big Portions,"We had an evening meal at the Royal Oak this week,which was far from ""donor eat there"", but the portions were huge and the food was far from badly poked but was more trenchermen food designed to fill rather than please the palate.",Date of visit: August 2013,The Royal Oak,4,"Pett, United Kingdom"
Long Shingle Beach,"We ventured to this beach today, the weather was lovely, the water wasverycloudy,nota sparkling swim!the beaches shingle,but despite the local caravan and holiday parks we felt as ifwe were thionyl people on the beach.",Date of experience: August 2013,Pett Level Beach,4,"Pett Level, United Kingdom"
Comfortable Stay,"In the middle of nowhere - which was lovely and quiet. There was a party going on next door that I think was something to do with the owners - we only know it was happening because they were talking about it in the bar and were not disturbed at all. The bedroom was nice and clean, we had tea and coffee making in the room with a good shower in the morning. Only thing was that there was some soap to wash hands with but no other toiletries. The towels were lovely though. Breakfast was cooked very well, if a bit short on selection -just cereal and cooked breakfast, no fruit offering. All in all it was a nice place and I would go back and stay if the need arose",Date of stay: August 2013,The Oak at Dewlish,4,"Dewlish, United Kingdom"
Lovely Beach,"This is a lovely beach and the water was very clear and inviting. The sand is lovely and fine. There is a section where clothes are not required, which if it is a problem do nt go, and there seemed to be lots of people walking through the dunes! But all in all a lovely location with sand stretching for a long way.",Date of experience: August 2013,Studland beach and Nature Reserve,4,"Studland, United Kingdom"
A good service - but very long wait!,"The ferry service was good, but the queue to get on the ferry was horrendous. It would have been quicker to drive around than take the ferry - waited over an hour to get on to it.",Date of experience: August 2013,Sandbanks Ferry,4,"Poole, United Kingdom"
Excellent Food and Service,I have eaten here several times with my wife as we live locally. The food has never ceased to be as expected and excellent. I would have no hesitation in recommending the restaurant.,Date of visit: July 2013,Sultan,4,"Cirencester, United Kingdom"
Good fun inland,"This is a great safe place to bring the kids to on a hot sunny day when you cannot get to the coast. Extras include pedlos, kayaks and those surf boards you propel along standing up with an oar!

It is possible to bring your own food and barbecue if you have to.",Date of experience: July 2013,Cotswold Country Park & Beach,4,"Cirencester, United Kingdom"

Beautiful,Well worth the walk down across the field and pathway. The scenery is gorgeous. We would have walked down to the beach but weather had ruined the steps.,Date of experience: July 2013,Lulworth Cove and Durdle Door,4,"West Lulworth, United Kingdom"
I would not recommend,"We arrived mid evening on a horrible evening expecting a room that had some kind of view (as was described on booking.com) - the room overlooked the car park and was very noisy in the morning from traffic and from what looked like a market. The room was very basic, and was very clean except some mould in the sealant at the head of the bath. I was expecting, and needing wifi, in the bedroom and could not connect. On raising this with reception I was told that it s possible in some rooms only, (again not as in the description) but I could get it in reception! My wife suffers with her back and the bed quite simply did not offer support for her and she was very sore in the morning. Dinner was ok, the service was let down by the food which was very mediocre. Breakfast really was not good, it buffet style which is fine but.... The bacon and sausages were cold, eggs were not nice and the fruit looked so unappetising I could not bring myself to eat any. We had to ask three times for tea and coffee, which by this time completed our decision to cancel our second night and move somewhere else. Needless to say the draw of the view from the restaurant and bar is far from sufficient to lure me back!",Date of stay: July 2013,The Heights Hotel,4,"Isle of Portland, United Kingdom"
Over priced,"I went to the swannery many years ago. There have been improvements, but it is basically the same and lovely to see the swans and cygnets. The entrance fee of £11.00 per adult, and the price of the food made for an expensive morning and went away feeling somewhat robbed.",Date of experience: July 2013,Abbotsbury Swannery,4,"Abbotsbury, United Kingdom"
Lovely Stay,"We stayed here recently, and would strongly recommend anyone to stay there. Colin and Jackie were very good hosts, and we were even very well looked after by Trevor and Jenny!

The room was immaculately clean, the welcome cup of tea with a piece of ginger cake was gorgeous and much appreciated after a long journey, breakfast on both mornings of our stay was cooked beautifully and set the day up! I could go on, we had a lovely, very comfortable stay and were looked after very very well.",Date of stay: July 2013,Leworthy Farmhouse,4,"Holsworthy, United Kingdom"
Our Honeymoon,"As this holiday was to be special and our honeymoon we looked at several five star resort hotels in lovely locations. The hotel is fairly new, but in many ways does not meet what I would consider to provide a five star status. Our room was not cleaned properly, and I personally would have expected branded drinks to be served, not cheaper inferior products, the food was ok and in three of the four restaurants the food had to be pre ordered from a very limited menu. The service was, in a Cape Verdian style and very slow, which is fine, but at this level of the market I would have expected a far greater attention to detail and possibly serving drinks to people at loungers and therefore clearing used glasses not allowing them to build up. There was a shortage of all types of glasses and it was difficult to change lounger towels. To be honest I feel that the product is very over priced and being run on a tight budget.",Date of stay: October 2012,Melia Tortuga Beach Resort & Spa,4,"Ilha do Sal, Cape Verde"
