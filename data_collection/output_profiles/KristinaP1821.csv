"Great fishing trip, good family fun","I have visited Rhodes,Greece in September and had a lovely time fishing with guys from Sostis & Saratonga Faliraki Fishing Trip.
Loads of exotic fish was caught during 3 hour trip and the boat team is very friendly, multy lingual, helpful and experienced-real professionals!
The tackle and bite was provided by the guys and the method of catching was also shown.We were changing places of fishing several times and every next place was holding bigger and more exotic fish then previous!
Boat is comfortable and safe, kids were provided with safety vests while sailing.
The boats holds authentic Greece fishing nets (guys are professional fisherman when not entertaining tourists:)so they know for sure there is the fish!
It was very easy to organise trip by phone and price is very reasonable for such a great fun.
Bonus - in the evening you can eat you catch in cosy taverna not far from harbour and its free!
One of MUST DO things while you are in Faliraki!
Nice holydays to everyone!
