Best in Rhodes!,"It’s simply fantastic! On top of very high quality food, the staff is excellent!! I come to Rhodes every year and try to stick to Greek food, because you can’t find quality Greek food in the US, but
can’t resist this place!!",Date of visit: July 2019,Cavo Italiano Italian restaurant,5,"Rhodes, Greece"

Boat trip,"There are many boats you can hire at Rhodes island but there’s only one where you will have the best meal of your life! It’s all about the food right? The captain and his first mate delivered our family a truly unforgettable experience we will cherish forever!

We can not recommend this experience enough and we’re trying to squeeze in another before we leave, but if not we’ll be back next year fore SURE!!!",Date of experience: July 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
