A Story of friendship !,"We arrived very early (4:50 am) in Milos port, no accomodation booked til then, no idea what should we do at this time, out from the ferryboat. First person we met in the habour was Kiriakos, the fisherman and his family on his boat Anna-Maria and he sold to us fresh fish!! We left at the end of November for a season end getaway. On top of that! If Kiriakos and his family had not been, we would probably have left the island of Milos again....
Kiriakos not only showed us the island with his big boat, but also provided us with fresh fish and salads on his boat for 4 days, as family. We heard very great and interesting stories and laughed a lot. We came as strangers and we left as friends. We thank you very much, Tina, Anna, Anna Maria and Kiriakos for this great time and that you have been there for us. You really saved our holiday!

Of cause you can stay in Winter on Milos, with fishingtrips and alot of good food with Kiriakos and family !

See you again, either back on Milos or in Crete!

Perfect Winter Stay,"We came for a rest of our own summer season in end of November 2019, to visit the island of Milos with incredible beaches and people.
We found a very: central of all, cosy, friendly and clean Hotel for all our needs. Katharina the owner and her team, have fulfilled all our extra wishes, including a change to a softer mattress. You saved my back, thanks!
We will come again, thank you for your hospitality.
