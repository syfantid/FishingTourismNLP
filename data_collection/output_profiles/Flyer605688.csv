Fantastic fajita,"Enjoyed the steak fajita so much and fantastic service from waiter Andrew. Overall, a lovely atmosphere and terrific food. Thank you",Date of visit: July 2020,Winning Post,4,"Twickenham, United Kingdom"
"Best food, ambience and service","Our 4th visit to the island and no trip would be complete without dining in Casa grec. Book in advance, this restaurant is packed every night for good reason.
The cheese soufflé with smoked duck starter was outstanding and the prawn Provençal cooked to perfection. Steaks amazing as always and the pork shank delicious. Can’t wait to return",Date of visit: August 2019,Casa Grec,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best day of the holiday,"Incredibly well organised and safe boat trip considering we were complete novices. Kristos gave excellent instruction about how to use the boat and how to stay safe. The boat was brand new and spotlessly clean. Very reasonable priced too. Decent shade and area to sunbathe. Incredible snorkelling and views.
Cool box provided but do take cold drinks and packed lunch. This is our 4th summer in lassi and will be booking this speed boat next time for sure.
Thank you!",Date of experience: August 2019,Lassi Rent A Boat,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
The best massage,An absolute treat and one of the best deep tissue massages I’ve ever had. I wish kristina lived in London!,Date of experience: August 2019,Kefalonia Massage Team-Christina,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great atmosphere and excellent food,"Always feel so welcome in this pub - the staff are friendly, the atmosphere fab and the food is a step above gastro pub - love this place for a date night",Date of visit: October 2017,The Roebuck,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Aptly named - Paradise for us....,"We visited kefalonia last year for our honeymoon and stayed at the ultra modern white rocks. We fell in love with the island and were fortunate to be able to visit villa paradiso before we booked it for this year.
We returned with the entire family - 3 generations from 4yrs - 74yrs, including teenagers and 20 somethings.
We were not disappointed, it is a rustic Greek villa - homely, atmospheric, and obviously a much loved former home which we felt honoured to stay in for a few weeks.
Granted, it's not high end luxury interior but we found it to be very comfortable and clean during our 2 weeks.
We spent most of our days outdoors on the fantastic patio with gas BBQ lunches, or at the pool with incredible views, or at Costa Costa beach (accessed by private steps from the villa)
From our visit to the villa last year we saw many improvements and look forward to the improvements that are planned for next year.
We've booked again for 2018, and we can't wait. Not a day went by during our stay where we didn't think 'this is truly paradise and we are incredibly lucky to be here!'
Pakos, the owner, couldn't do enough for us to make our stay fantastic.
Can't wait to return!",Date of stay: June 2017,VillaParadisso,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Outstanding food, service and atmosphere","A local taxi driver recommended this place to us and we are very grateful. The steaks were out of this world, taste sensation. This will be our first stop restaurant when we return to kefalonia next year. A hidden gem.",Date of visit: June 2017,Casa Grec,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Outstanding experience - a must do!,"An incredible day out - authentic fishing boat experience. Retrieving the 2km nets that have been cast out at 2am prior to the trip adds to the excitement, because whatever is caught is cooked fresh for lunch on the boat's tiny but adequate kitchen.

Amazed at how good a cook Capitani michelas is - everything was perfect from the lobster spaghetti to the homemade pastry desserts.

Don't miss the chance to do this boat trip - it will be the best day of the holiday for sure and talked about for many years to come.",Date of experience: June 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fish eaters paradise,"We went as a big table of 7, age range 4years to 74years. Second time we've been in kefalonia and best fish we've ever had. Real Greek experience, we are from London, all other patrons in restaurant were Greek - says a lot. Please try shrimp saganaki. Best on island !",Date of visit: June 2017,Aristofanis Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Private chartered the most authentic Greek boat trip,"This boat trip was by far the best day of the holiday. Snorkelling, exploring beaches and lagoons not accessible by road, and general relaxing - this experience was the ultimate luxury.
And so glad we decided to book the authentic Greek sailing boat with this lovely family - 2 brothers and mamma Angelica who supplied the most delicious home made food.
We are returning to kefalonia next year and already planning to book another full day and a sunset cruise",Date of experience: August 2016,Kefalonia Trips QueenBee,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely place and staff - shame the management not making the most of it,"White rocks hotel has a lot going for it overlooking the gorgeous beaches of lassi, which is a fantastic scenic and family friendly resort but the hotel itself could be so much better. Although the bungalow accommodation is outstanding - as long as you get the genuine rather than distant beach view, the rules beggar belief.
The staff are trying so hard to accommodate but they seem to be bound by so many management rules and it is very obvious. The general staff were lovely but looked permanently terrified by management rules.
Breakfast time - the main man manager at the door (the only man on the resort who is ""allowed"" to tell you which table to sit at) makes do with aggressively spitting out the table number in sheer miserable disdain - retire man, don't bring our holiday down every day - it's hard earned cash! Fine the first few days, but after 14 days of bordering aggression - NO! So we get to our directed table every morning and just watch him go as he struts the restaurant giving his staff the death stare and verbal dressing downs. The ultimate fun sucker is that one. Pity that it sinks the whole holiday vibe and the staff are trying so hard to be jovial under that management.

And woe betide if you sleep in for the 9.30am cut off point for breakfast! The pool bar does sell good toasties, pizzas etc, but despite the bar opening at 9.30am, they are ""not allowed"" to serve food until 12. So, either starve or get a taxi into lassi.
So after breakfast and onwards to the lovely pool - but it doesn't open until 9am. So what happens is a Q of people with towels are hanging around from around 8.30 - butlins-like. But there are rules, and the white rocks hotel do love their rules, especially chain mail no entry barriers. There are barriers all round the pool, and hotel for that matter. Not sure if they are just enjoying seeing people fall over them on way to toilet - reeks of POOR management yet again.
The hotel is VERY spread out, and it took us a week to work out the fastest route from our bungalow to breakfast or pool, and constantly being stopped by other holiday makers asking directions- some signs would be good.
Lunch time - food plentiful - only choice of 2 starters and 2 mains but both high quality produce. But please don't go off piste and ask for ANYTHING done slightly differently. The poor lovely waitress was either terrified of chef or management (probably both) and anything that deviates from the 2 choices would bring on a potential melt down. And after a gorgeous, plentiful lunch, please don't spy the £2000 shiny coffee machine taking pride of place on the bar. Coffee not allowed after lunch??? What??? Coffee is lunch. But the waitress insists the machine is not allowed to be switched on and if I want coffee, I need to climb 2 floors of stairs, find a waitress in the foyer and wait an age for just a coffee.
Dress code for dinner was a joke - multi coloured long euro trash yoga pants for men ok, tailored,Paul smith knee length shorts not ok?
Only inflatables in pool had to be swimming aids for kids, that was ignored thankfully.
Such a shame a happy manager couldn't take over this beautiful hotel who had a penchant for joy. It could be so much better under different management - it's got everything going for it!",Date of stay: August 2016,White Rocks Hotel Kefalonia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
DREAM WEDDING CEREMONY & RECEPTION,"When we were first looking around Richmond for a venue that could hold our wedding ceremony and reception, we found very few places that could cater for our tastes or our numbers - 100plus guests for the ceremony and meal, more for the reception.
We did visit a few other venues as well as the Bingham but found them regimented, impersonal, wedding factories - they told us how our wedding would pan out, that we had to stick to their approved bands or djs, set menu, timetable, share the venue with other weddings on the day. No thanks!
Then we found the Bingham and started to get very excited about our big day - Amy was delighted to give us the wedding we wanted and NOTHING was too much trouble in the run up, or on the day.
Amy responded to the daftest of questions and requests not within hours but within minutes and went the extra mile to make it a very special day not just for us but for our guests.
The location and setting speaks for itself, probably the most stunning wedding location in the borough, but the food is worth a special mention. Yes, we were blown away at the tasting, especially as chef had created us a starter that we requested which was not on the set menu. But could that standard of food be delivered to 100 plus people on the day? Oh yes, and there was plenty of it. Our guests are still raving about the high standard of the fine dining caliber of the meal.
On the day itself, Amy, Nikheil and their fine staff ran the day like clockwork but we never felt at any point rushed and the staff treated us and our guests with kindness and good humour.
In fact we felt so at home it was like we owned the place.
And the morning after, when I realised they were cleaning up for another wedding taking place that day, I laughed out loud - they had made me feel like our wedding was the only wedding taking place that year, never mind that weekend, and I mean that as a compliment.
Thank you Amy, Nikeil and all your gorgeous, kind staff, Carolyn & Joe",Date of visit: July 2016,Steven Edwards Riverhouse,4,"Richmond-upon-Thames, United Kingdom"
