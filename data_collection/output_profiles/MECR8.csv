Do not go there if you want decent food!,Ordered the 'burger and a beer' meal deal and the food that came was awful. I would rather have gone to McDonalds. I should have returned the food but was so hungry ate a few chips and left - I certainly wont be returning.,Date of visit: August 2020,The Old Brewery,1,"Marlow, United Kingdom"
"Great food, great atmosphere",The food and service was excellent. Had the house Lebanese wine that was delicious. I'd recommend a visit to this restaurant!,Date of visit: January 2020,Lebanese Village,1,"Caversham, United Kingdom"
Would definitely recommend!,Waking up to the beautiful view from our room (Royal Ocean Suite) was phenomenal. Fantastic breakfast and the staff were great. If you are visiting this area I suggest staying here! We hired a scooter to get around as the walk to amenities was a bit dangerous at night (and a touch far) but it was very cheap and felt safe on the roads.,Date of stay: June 2019,Puri Mas Boutique Resort & Spa,1,"Lombok, Indonesia"
Paradise!,"Fantastic private island. Staff were always on hand, great beach, not over crowded. Didn't want to leave! The only draw back was perhaps lack of menu choice, food was great but would maybe have liked a separate lunch menu.",Date of stay: January 2019,Club Paradise Palawan,1,"Dimakya Island, Philippines"
This is a must do!,"Absolutely fantastic day! From beginning to end we had a great time. We loved helping get the fish out of the nets, Dimitrios let us be as hands-on as we wanted to. The food cooked and prepared by the couple was delicious and Efi's calamari is THE best around! We even had cherries from their garden after lunch. You don't have to like fishing to do this trip, just enjoy the sea air, clear water and most fresh fish on the Island!
Great couple and a brilliant trip!
