What a surprise!,"We have spent a wonderful day with Cristine and her husband: that day we were the only guests and had a sort of private tour. We have assisted them retrieving the fishing net that was positioned the night before and we have been very lucky capturing some very nice fishes!
After some pics to the catched fishes we moved to Fteri where we had the chance to take a bath and also walk on that extraordinary place. We then had a second stop at the blue lagoon and finally, with perfect timing reached Kamari beach. Another long bath, some sun on the beach...a nice talk with Christina before getting back on the boat for a really delicius lunch: an aragosta and a big seabream have been grilled together with other smaller but tasty fishes .
The tour is definitely highly recommended, on the boat the atmosphere was friendly and relaxed. Landscapes, beaches and water just impossible to describe. If you are in Kefalonia do not miss it!",Date of experience: July 2019,Kefalonia Fishing Tours,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
imbarazzante,"vi abbiamo cenato la sera di Ferragosto, il menu non ispira fiducia e i prezzi son da ristorante di altro livello. Ci si orienta su fritti misti e grigliate di carne. Entrambi pessimi, la carne davvero impresentabile. Delusione totale. Da evitare.",,Vadis Ristorante Pizzeria,1,"Sardinia, Italy"
