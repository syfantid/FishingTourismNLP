Most amazing day!,"We have just had one of the most memorable days of our lives.
All thanks to Dimitrios and Efthimia.
What a day! And where to start?!?
First of all we must say if you are visiting the island this is a MUST do trip. Even if you do one this has to be it.
We saw turtles, seals and so many types of fish.
Helped trawl the fish from the sea and helped get them out of the net. We learned so much about each fish thst was caught, Dimitrios and Efthimia are so knowledgeable and truly know what they are talking about.
We sailed to two remote beaches.
Both breathtaking.
One had a pit of natural clay. We covered ourselves in it. It felt amazing to use earths natural resources in that way. Our skin looked and felt like we'd been at a spa for the day.
Even our teenage son joined in.
We swam in the perfect turquoise waters and so much fun diving and jumping off the boat.
While we were left to enjoy our surroundings Dimitrios and Efthimia were preparing and cooking up a storm on board. All the fish caught from the morning we ate.
It was the best meal we'd eaten since being here.
Everything was so fresh and tasty. We were astounded with all that was provided. Homemade lemonade, wine, fresh watermelon,  salads, fish, bread. We were all stuffed!
The boat was constantly being hosed down and kept clean.
We could go on and on but you just have to experience it yourself.
It's for every age from young to old (or wise)
Really was a day to remember.

Thank you so much Dimitrios and Efthimia!!

We will be coming back again!!
