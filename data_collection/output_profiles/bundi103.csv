My best day in Zaky,"1st impression: the looking of the ship: beautifully maintained and amazing clean
2nd impression: warm and smiling welcome of the captain and its crew
3nd impression: the sailing to the fishing spot, with Cpt.Giorgos and his presentation what we gonna do and why
4th impression: the beautiful and unique beaches where we couldn't get access without this amazing team
5th impression: the chance to have a little taste of this heavy fishing life
6th impression: tasting the delicious lunch prepared out of our catch, prepared by Cpt.Giorgos (NO, it was not his reward, but his lovely team member)
7th impression: the kindness and patient he showed to all of us
8th impression: he wanted to drive us back to the hotel, when our taxi didnt show up
9th impression: few hours after the cruise, we have already got the pics he made
I can probably keep listing impressions here, but the point is, that Zante Fishing Cruise is an absolute recommended category, u can miss the shipwreck beach, u can miss the island tour, but never miss this tour!!! U will get wonderful experience what the perfect hosting mean!!!
Thank u Cpt.Giorgos Nikolatos!!",Date of experience: September 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,5,"Zakynthos, Greece"
