Brilliant,"According to my moody 16 year old this was the ‘best day yet!’. Really authentic trip. Two lovely Greek fellas who look after you, help the kids with the fishing and cook a fantastic meal with the fish you’ve caught. Throw in some snorkelling and jumping off the boat and it’s a winner! Book it and enjoy.",Date of experience: August 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
