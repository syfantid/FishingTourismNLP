Unforgettable experience!!,"We took part in this tour in August and had the most amazing time!! I have done a few boat trips in different parts of Greece and this one stands out as the most unique and unforgettable experience!
Dimitrios and Efthimia were wonderful hosts and so helpful and friendly! Been able to experience fishing with nets was so fun and then we had those fish prepared for lunch. The meal that was prepared for lunch was absolutely delicious! Along with the fish there were a selection of other dished prepared with ingredients from Dimitrios and Efthimia's own garden.
The swimming stops throughout the tour were stunning! We really enjoyed been able to swim in such secluded beaches with crystal blue water.
Overall this tour was a highlight of our Greece trip and I would highly recommend it to anyone!",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Amazing experience!!,"I was part of a group of 4 who recently spent 4 nights at Trinity, we were all absolutely taken aback with how wonderful our time there was!

We arrived late following a long fligt and delays at the airport and were happily greeted by the owner Toula, who kindly provided us with wine and an array of snacks! Even though it was late she sat with us and answered any questions we had plus provided some excellent suggestions on what to see in Rhodes.

Mornings were always a delight as we were treated to the most delicious breakfast by the lovely Georgia! She was very accomodating of any dietary requirements and would remember what each of us liked, the omelettes in particular were amazing! After many hotel breakfasts I can without hesitation say that the breakfasts provided at Trinity were the best I have had! We thoroughly enjoyed the company of Georgia and she was always so lovely and helpful.

The hotel itself is simply stunning! The rooms were spotless and beautifully decorated. It was an incredible experience to stay in Rhodes Old Town and be so close to the Street of the Knights and the Palace. The area the hotel is in has such character and you can really immerse yourself in medieval Rhodes.

Overall I cannot recommend Trinity Boutique Hotel highly enough!! I cannot wait to return in the future!
