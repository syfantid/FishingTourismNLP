0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V5136YMantoniac,October 2020,5,great afternoon our at sea,We had an amazing time on Captain Tasos boat.  We actually managed to fish quite a lot under the fantastic supervision of the female skipper! We also learned a lot about the Aegean sea and Kos. After the trip our fish was prepared in a nearby restaurant which we very much  enjoyed! We even got invited to pass by another time and enjoy some octopus on board! a most memorable experience!! thank you! Epharisto! 
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/958jackf,October 2020,5,Great trip!,"Great fishing trip with lots of action, would definitely recommend to any anglers looking to get a few hours of fishing in during their holidays"
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djne11026,October 2020,5,Couldn’t be better,We didn’t do the fishing trip but the one hour mini cruise which went ahead despite there only being two of us on board. We went along both sides of the harbour and enjoyed the trip. Care was taken in relation to Covid. Capt Tasos is obviously a friendly character and we loved the dog.

4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventuremen,August 2020,5,Truly amazing fishing trip! Must do in kos city!,"a friend of mine and I were looking for a fun fishing trip, and that's exactly what we found.  when we arrived at the boat we asked for some information about the trip, which we immediately received with open arms.  they were very clear about the possibility of catching fish that day and were very honest about it.  Mrs. Timmy immediately indicated that the chance was small that we would catch something because of the strong wind and the big waves, we thought that was a shame but still wanted to join them on the fishing trip.  the trip was about 4 hours and costs 40 euros per person. this is well worth it also because after the fishing you were able to eat the caught fish yourself at a restaurant that prepares the caught fish (voluntarily) for you for free, it is nice to order something on top of it, so they can earn something on it as they are not making any money on the brought fish. On board was Timmy (She likes to call herself the captain but is actually the fun maker on board) and alexis (the real captain who is actually present for the balance of the boat (that's how he liked to call himself). both very nice and happy to tell us how to catch the fish in the best possible way etc. despite the fact that they indicated before the trip that it would not be very successful we still caught 20 fish which we have eaten in the restaurant. it has been super successful and we had a great time. We even went with them for a second time. definitely recommended for all sport anglers to join the trip!Timmy the captain Alexis for the balans Captain vekko (dog)"

3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cristianbL9094AZ,July 2019,5,Fishing,"I spent two weeks in Kos and I booked a fishing trip before the arrival, via facebook.  I enjoyed it so much, the price was good for a 4 hour trip and we caught great fish so I rebooked a second trip with captain tasos! We liked that we took the fish and a restaurant in the nearby cooked it for free. Thank you!"
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giorgianam25,July 2019,5,The best,"Evert time I go to Kos I book for a fishing trip with Captain Tasos. It’s a really nice experience and the staff is very friendly. Once I caught an octopus, it felt so nice! You guys are awesome! If you go to Kos, you should try it! You will go for a second one, for sure! I went there 4 times!   Sometimes they took photos which is great!"
0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marianamotea,June 2019,5, Unforgettable ,It's a great experience and definitely the best fishing trip in Kos. I caught big fishes. The staff is very friendly and they help you if you need. Strongly recommend! 
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicofelea,July 2019,5,Unforgettable experience,"Nothing compares to catch your first fish ever! I spent 4 awsome hours on this trip and I loved it!  The team of Captain Tasos is really nice, funny and they know to entertain you even you sre not the luckiest fisherman on Earth  A great point is that we took the fish we caught to a restaurant where they cooked it for us for free, we paid only for the drinks and other dishes. It's a must and unforgettable experience if you go to Kos "
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/575famk,July 2019,5,Great Fishing trip :),"We’ve had a very nice fishing experience with Captain Tasos. They have good fishing gear and know where the places are to catch the fish. I recommend this if you want to have a sea fishing trip. They also make pictures when you are fishing, thats really great as well. "
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zigzagprinromania1,June 2019,5,Amazing,It was a great experience and professional team. I strongly recommend it to all my friends.Thanks a lot!
4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davedurose,September 2018,5,Great value for money,"Me and my partner has an amazing time on this trip. Due to an expected storm a lot of boat trips had been cancelled, we rang up the same morning when the weather was now good and calm and were told if we could get down for 10 we could go ahead and if we were going to be slightly late they would wait. When we arrived the staff were very friendly and it turned out we had the whole boat to ourselves. What you catch you take to a local restaurant and they cook your fish to your personal taste. It makes for a really fun day. The staff are amazing and are constantly making you laugh. 5 stars!"
