Best Fishing experience on Milos!!,"Rosa and Nikos were extremely welcoming and made every effort to get us to have a great time! They took us to the most gorgeous, isolated aquamarine waters where we swam and then ate delicious fish, soup, salad and dessert prepared by them on the boat... of course using the fish just freshly caught... it was an unforgettable, authentic and traditional fishing experience that we would highly recommend to everyone! We felt like we were at home, part of the family with them. Efkaristo poli, Rosa and Nikos!-Susie and William, Canada",Date of experience: June 2019,Milos Fishing Experience,5,"Milos, Greece"
The Best Hotel on Aegina,"Hotel Rachel is by far the most hospitable and best located hotel on the island. Maria and Ioannis (John) are the absolute best hosts and they are above all what made our stay memorable! This hotel is quiet in the off season and close enough to the 'action' for the tourist season, so no matter what time you pick, the location is the best! Their breakfast (with fresh yummy Greek bread) is an absolute TREAT and the clothing store (watch out especially the ladies!) is AMAZING!! I definitely profited from that beautiful selection of summer clothing!

If you are looking for a place that feels like home in the middle of paradise, just stay with Maria and Ioannis and you will have the BEST TIME! We sure did and we will be back again!
