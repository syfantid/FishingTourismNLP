Choose your chef in skiathos from chef 2 chef gluten free and vegan recipes,Surely the best choice if you want to take off your senses! Gourmet alchemy of the best Greek chefs (as we found out later on because we didnt expect such low prices) as the Chefs are well known in Greece and they personal served us chef Dim. Agorastos and El. Mpairamis two names one restaurant chef to chef we will never forget.
