Lifetime experiance,My hubby has done this trip now twice. Once in May then in October. Both trips for him was fantastic. Truly what he wanted which was a hands on experience on a fishing boat. The company on board with the family was excellent. Good fun and good food and I know he would go again next year. Thank you to Antonia and her family for making him feel at home. Yours Janet and Michael ellis. Pesssda.,Date of experience: October 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
