3 stars? should be more,Just got back from a 10 day family holiday at the Sunday hotel. I must say it is the cleanest hotel I have ever visited. The family that own it are so welcoming and helpful nothing is to much trouble. The pool area is great for kids and the garden has lots of sunbeds so there is always beds available. The food is amazing! The local restaurants are good don't get me wrong but The hotel food is superb and is a bit less expensive than the restaurants so if you don't fancy walking out into the resort just eat at the hotel you won't be disappointed. Wednesday night they have a Greek night with lots of traditional Greek food and a group of traditional Greek dancers which is quite fun as they get you up dancing and everybody has a good laugh. I can't recommend this hotel enough we had a great stay which was made that little bit extra special by the family that run it luvly people.,Date of stay: July 2018,Sunday Hotel,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Highlight of the holiday,What a brilliant day!! Fishing was great ww caught 32 between 10 of us on the boat which where cooked for us along with some fresh sea bream the captain's friend who he works as a pro fisherman in the winter with caught that very morning. Non fish eaters got a big bbq chicken breast all cooked meat and fish was served with a big shell of Greek salad and some toasted bread followed by watermelon for afters. It was amazing! Even the salad was sliced and diced on the boat while we were fishing. We stopped at a really nice spot before the bbq to have a swim and a snorkel it was such a great day the crew where amazing. Beer and soft drinks like coke and water are available all trip just ask a crew member. I'd love to do this trip again!,Date of experience: July 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"

Great hotel,Stayed here at the weekend to visit the Xmas market. Great location very clean room friendly competent staff and has a nice lobby and bar area. The bar is a little expensive as with most hotels but it's comfortable and the bar staff are friendly with a good sense of humour. Ideal base for a stay in dussledorf I've heard the city is even better in the summer,Date of stay: December 2017,Leonardo Royal Hotel Düsseldorf Königsallee,1,"Düsseldorf, Germany"
Best Indian in the area,Another great meal here Saturday night. I love this place I could eat here every night!! Had a meal with my family a biggish Patsy of 7 including my 2 young children. The food and service are second to none. Shah and the team make you feel so welcome they are brilliant with the children to such a great team. The food is absolutely superb and the 4 course set menu has so much choice and is great value. There are also more exotic dishes that you don't see a lot in other restaurants so if you fancy somthing different the team are happy to advise you what you may like according to your taste. I even came here for Christmas dinner this year and it was the best Christmas I've ever had. The cobra here is amazing!! Some restaurants it's not so good but shah keeps it really well. Amazing place to eat or have a takeaway.,Date of visit: February 2017,Cardamom Lounge,1,"Leicester, United Kingdom"
Simply outstanding!!,Had a fantastic stay here at the weekend. The rooms are spotlessly clean and have everything you need and the hosts are amazing! We were doing a Snowden challenge on the Saturday and had an early start. Lynn and david got up especially to cook us an early breakfast so we could eat before we went. The breakfast was out of this world I can honestly say it was the best bacon I have ever eaten!! And everything else was just as nice. Perfectly poached eggs to!! It's making me hungry thinking about it while I'm writing this review. We also had our bikes with us which were safely locked up for us when not in use nothing is to much trouble.We are definatly going to go back in the near future his place is top class. Many thanks to Lynn and david for looking after us,Date of stay: April 2016,Mary's Court Guest House,1,"Betws-y-Coed, United Kingdom"

Excellent food great service,Had a nice meal with my wife and 2 young children to celebrate my wife's birthday. The food was excellent!! I had a fillet steak which was cooked to perfection my wife had the Seabass which in her own words she could eat everyday of the week and not get bored of it as it was that good. The children ordered off of the kids menu. My daughter had the scampi which she wolfed down and my fussy son just had pasta and cheese which wasn't on the menu but the chef made it for him specially. Great food excellent service no waiting for drinks and the food came quite quickly even tho the restaurant was quite full. We had the home made cheese cake for desert and wasn't dissapointed as it was also excellent. For the real ale lovers there are a great selection of beers which are perfectly kept and you get a discount if you are a member of CAMRA. Perfect family meal thank you to the manager and the team.,Date of experience: February 2016,"The Plough, Littlethorpe",1,"Leicester, United Kingdom"

Nice place,Stayed here last week. Nice clean hotel and the staff are very welcoming and attentive. Nice bar downstairs with sky TV and a pool table with a good selection of beers. I never ate the food on the bar menu but what I saw of what others ordered it looked really good. I would recommend this hotel and I would definatly stay here again. If I was to nit pick the only thing I would say is my room was a little on the warm side other than that it was great,Date of stay: May 2014,Strathdon Hotel - Nottingham,1,"Nottingham, United Kingdom"
The pitts,Avoid at all cost and that's being polite!! This place doubles as a half way house for immigrants. The lift smelt of urine and tge carpets on tge landing and in my room were stained and thread bare in places. The whole place smelt of stale cigarette smoke. Spend an extra tenner and stay elsewear you won't regret it.,Date of stay: May 2014,The Britannia Nottingham Hotel,1,"Nottingham, United Kingdom"
