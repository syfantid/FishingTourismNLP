Don't bother,"Mediocre food.
Don't be fooled by happy hour cheap cocktails as rest of bill makes up for it.
Go to Fois instead.",Date of visit: August 2018,Acropolis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic day trip,Highlight of our holiday. Day out on a fishing boat. Watched the nets being drawn in. The lobster and fish were then cooked on the boat for our lunch. Can't get any fresher than that ! Had nice length of time to swim off the boat to an isolated beach to work up an appetite. Wonderful home cooking. Small group of about ten in total. Really very friendly family. Highly recommended.,Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Spectacular underground lake,Boat trip (gondola type) around underground cave. Roof fell in to reveal lake . Spectacular colours especially around midday as overhead sun shines in thru the water,Date of experience: August 2018,Melissani Cave,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fine dining in Portsmouth,Wonderful food and service. Even the cheeses were presented on a trolley and explained in detail. Complimentary hors doevres with pre dinner drinks,Date of visit: September 2015,Restaurant 27,4,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom"
Excellent hotel close to the Apollo,"Converted old red brick school , with plenty of history. Lovely room , surprise upgrade . V quiet haven in the middle of London. Great location , within 10 minutes walk of the Apollo. Perfect stay...Kate Bush concert plus fab hotel. Stephen in the restaurant / bar so attentive for our afternoon cream tea....ensuring our pot of tea was constantly replaced and at the perfect temperature and strength..a real sweetie. He was also there for our post show night cap.
The cooked breakfast was very good with the best breakfast mushrooms that I have tasted at a hotel and the hash browns were excellent. The service at breakfast was not as good but they were quite busy ( perhaps we had been spoilt by Stephen , the day before )
We will definitely book the hotel again if we go to another concert at the Apollo or weekends in London",Date of stay: September 2014,St Paul's Hotel,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Had a great time,"We had a 4 night break on Sark. Wonderful hotel with very friendly staff. Beautiful rooms . Great food with a wide choice on the menu with fresh , locally sourced produce. We will definitely stay there again.",Date of stay: June 2014,Stocks Hotel,4,"Sark, United Kingdom"
Five stars for Five years,This year was our fifth holiday in Svoronata. This is our favourite restaurant which we go back to year after year. Cannot fault the food or service. Music on Saturday was genuine with not a mike or amplifier in sight and the two young dancers were fabulous with no gimmicks Already looking forward to our next visit,Date of visit: August 2013,Fois,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
