Fantastic lunch here today.,"Fantastic lunch here today. The food was delicious, the service was perfect and ambience just right. It was quiet when we arrived at about 12.45pm but soon picked up. The one waitress, Sharon, was brilliant and never missed a beat.
We’ve always loved the food here and this time was no different. We’ll be back.",Date of visit: October 2020,Red Dog Saloon,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Lovely meal and great staff,"My husband and I had a very nice spontaneous meal here last night. The service was fantastic, the food was very good and the atmosphere was nice. Very impressed and would happily go back.",Date of visit: October 2020,Curry Lounge,4,"New Romney, United Kingdom"
Disappointing,"It didn’t start well the waitress told us that most of the ales had run out. But we ordered our drinks, which duly arrived, and then we were forgotten. After eventually making eye contact with a waitress a couple of times, she came to take our order. (The next table also had to find a waitress to take their order) My prawn cocktail (which was nearly £8!) was mediocre to say the least. The sauce tasted like it was out of a bottle and more like a thousand island dressing than a Rose Marie sauce. But I let it go. I had ordered a Southern Fried Chicken burger for main but what turned up was three bland chicken gougons which would have more suited to a child’s menu in a bun with some tomato and lettuce. By no stretch of the imagination was this Southern Fried Chicken. It wouldn’t have been a good burger if it had been described as a three chicken gougon burger. It’s was tasteless. The slaw was a pot the size a sauce is poured into. The chips were lovely. But overall a very disappointing meal. When the waitress asked how it was, I told her about the chicken. She was absolutely lovely and let the chef know. The chef on duty’s response was, “this is what we’re serving”. It may be so but it’s still not SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN. She gave us £3 off the bill which was all she was able to do which was kind of her. We paid and left. Will definitely not be returning.",Date of visit: October 2020,The Ship Hotel Restaurant,4,"New Romney, United Kingdom"
Doesn’t get any better than this!,"We’ve always been fans of the Olive Lounge as we stay in Lourdas where the original restaurant was located. We were a bit devastated when it moved up to the castle but we’ve managed to make two visits to the restaurant this holiday and it’s even better than before.
Liana runs a tight ship, running around ensuring everything is just right and everyone is taken care of. And her hard work ethic is clearly reflected in her staff. We were pleased to see some familiar faces amongst the waiting staff. They are all excellent - a cut above the rest - Service is impeccable.
The food is the best we’ve experienced anywhere in the island and the portion sizes are just right. My husband had the sea bream last week and the moussaka last night, and I had the surf and turf and the burger on respective evenings, and we shared a calamari starter. All was delicious. The restaurant was full both evenings we went and there was a lovely buzz of happy eaters.
Even though we can’t get to eat there quite as often now it has moved, the new location is just wonderful with the most stunning views. Watching the sunset from there is simply awesome. And we’ve come to realise that Liana deserves to be in a castle. Long may she reign! We’ll be back for sure.",Date of visit: August 2020,The Olive Lounge,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic day out with the best food!,"Absolutely fabulous day out with Michalis Fishing. Antonia greeted us with Greek coffee and the most fabulous cake which her daughter had made. Once the other two families had joined us we set sail for where Captain Michalis had set the nets the previous day. We watched as the nets were reeled in and the catch was removed from the nets, and then we stopped in a lovely bay for a swim. Whilst we relaxed in the water Antonia made the most delicious bruschetta with all fresh ingredients - so tasty. Then we set sail for an alternative spot for another swim stop whilst lunch was prepared. I can’t describe how fantastic the food was. A good fish restaurant in London would have charged a small fortune for half of what we ate. Absolutely beautiful. The wine and water flowed all day too. After lunch and another few swims and relaxing on the boat in the sun we set off back to the marina.
It was the perfect day. The hosts were so friendly and it was really interesting watching the nets being brought up and emptied. And then the catch being turned into our lunch! But even if you don’t have the remotest interest in fishing you will still have a great day out on the water with lovely people. We would thoroughly recommend it. If you’re concerned about Covid-19 this year I can assure you they very much look after you - The boat is bigger than I expected but they don’t take out too many people so social distancing is not a problem. With temperature checks etc on arrival they clearly take every precaution to make sure everything is safe for their guests.
We absolutely loved it and will definitely book when we’re next in Kefalonia. Thank you to everyone on board for making our day so special.

Always a warm welcome and,"Always a warm welcome and an ice cold beer, perfectly served. Best views in town and a relaxed vibe. So happy to be back in our favourite Kefalonia bar.",Date of visit: August 2020,Bar 360,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fabulous- don’t miss this place,"We are staying almost next door to this restaurant. It had been recommended to us a few times this week so we finally went last night. Wow, even better than we expected. Fantastic food, lovely staff and stunning views. The prices are also very reasonable.
Lourdas lost Olive Lounge to the Castle area a couple of years ago and we really felt the village was in need of a restaurant to offer the similar experience, and I think this is it. Thank goodness we tried it early enough in our holiday that we’ll be able to return at least once more. A wonderful addition to Lourdas!",Date of visit: August 2020,Chefalonia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fabulous food and lovely staff,"We had a spontaneous meal here last Saturday evening. We hadn’t booked and it was extremely busy so we didn’t think we’d get a table but they managed to seat us. It was first time I’d been there, my husband had been previously with friends, and I was very impressed. The menu is quite extensive and has some different options from other Indian restaurants I’ve been to. The food was absolutely delicious (I had a chilli chicken korai, pilau rice and saag paneer). I couldn’t fault it. The saag paneer was the tastiest I can remember having anywhere. The service was a little slow but not enough to bother us and for which the manager (?) apologised, unprompted, when we paid our bill.
Having previously been loyal customers of Ruchi until we had a couple of just average meals on the trot and were then charged twice for a meal (and they would not knowledge) we were looking for a new Indian to frequent and I think we’ve found it! Highly recommended.",Date of visit: November 2019,The Raj,4,"Billericay, United Kingdom"
Fab food and top staff,"We've been to Gallachers a few times over the last couple of years, nost recently last Saturday, and we always have a great time. We are always warmly welcomed by owner, Adrian, and so well looked after by his wonderful FOH team. The food is delicious and huge, and being a smallish restaurant it has very homely feel. They have a very good selection of beer and some more interesting non-alcoholic drinks. Highly recommended. So much so, infact, that we've booked in again for next Friday!",Date of visit: September 2019,Gallacher's Smokehouse Bar and Grill,4,"Leigh-on Sea, United Kingdom"
Fabulous day out,"I’ll admit I’m a bit of a waterbaby anyway but this is a great way to spend a day! Sailing around the beautiful south of Thassos we had 3 swim stops, no spoilers, but all in beautiful locations. We were treated to a breakfast of fresh bread and jams, a delicious lunch of shrimp with pasta and a dessert (I don’t know what it was but it was lovely!) Nikos even picked us up and dropped us back at our hotel in Potos. What a glorious way to spend a day, very tranquil and relaxing. We were also very lucky in that the other two couples were so lovely. Great day out. Highly recommended. Thanks Nikos!",Date of experience: July 2019,Aeolus Yachting,4,"Thásos, Greece"
Fabulous!,"Had the most lovely of evenings here on Friday. Our first night on Thassos and we picked well! We were greeted with the warmest of welcomes and seated at a lovely table at the front near the beach - the perfect spot to watch the sun set. The service, the food and the ambience were all fantastic. I had the moussaka and my husband had the sea bream, both were delicious. The complimentary soup and dessert were a wonderful extra surprise. Can’t imagine we’re going to be able to top this restaurant during our stay and will undoubtedly be back on more than one occasion. Highly recommended.",Date of visit: July 2019,San Antonio Beach Restaurant,4,"Thásos, Greece"
"Lovely staff and smart, clean rooms","We booked this premier inn as we were attending a party nearby. Being in the town centre has its advantages - it was easy to get an Uber, but not having a carpark was a bit of a faff. We would like to have arrived before 5.30pm ideally. But a small thing. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the room was clean and looked newly decorated. Bed was very comfy as promised! This is the first time I've stayed in a Premier Inn but I woudl happily do so again.",Date of stay: July 2019,Premier Inn London Orpington hotel,4,"Orpington, United Kingdom"
Fabulous!,"We went on Julia’s wine tasting tour last week and it was absolutely wonderful. We had high expectations after reading the lovely reviews on here but it even surpassed those! Julia picked us up (spot on 4pm!) from out hotel, and drove us to her family home and vineyard in the Omaha valley. She explained how the vines are planted, grown and cared for and all about the process of growing Robola grapes. She made us an amazing greek meze which I am definitely going to try to recreate this week! We sampled some unique wines and grappe! So good. We then went on a tour of the Robola winery. We had been on a previous tour of Robola but on a day out with a tour operator in a large group where it was all rather rushed and impersonal. With Julia it was completely personally, just Julia and the two of us, we had a good chance to see the whole process and sample some lovely examples of their wine. We were lucky in that we happened to be there just as they were harvesting the grapes so we saw them loading the grapes into presses. Really interesting.
We then drove to the Divina (sp?) vineyard for another tour and some further sampling, including some absolutely delicious balsamic vinegar, before being driven back to our hotel, a little tipsy, I might add!

This is such a great experience. Julia is lovely and very down to earth, and absolutely passionate about what she does. There were only the two of us on our tour (I think there are sometimes up to six people) which made it so personal, the bigger tour operator tours just can’t compete with this. The whole experience was just over four hours long and we got to sample plenty of wines. Although we did purchase some wines at both wineries there was no pressure what so ever, but there was no way we were leaving without some! At €55 per person for the whole experience, we felt it was an absolute bargain. When we return to Kef we will definitely be doing the tour again, even if it is identical in content! Can’t recommend this trip highly enough. Thank you so much, Julia!",Date of experience: August 2018,Kefalonia Wine Tour,4,"Kourtesi, Greece"
Another fantastic visit!,"Just returned from our fourth stay at Maria Anna in Lourdas and it was just as great as the first three visits. We always said we wouldn’t go back to the same place on holiday but we’ve kind of got hooked on this place. Jenny and Gregory make you feel like part of the family and always take such good care of us. They have a great team with them; Dora does all of the cleaning and I’m sure a lot more behind the scenes, Dave does the breakfasts and lunches and Julie runs a slick bar. All lovely, lovely people who contributed towards a wonderful two weeks.
The hotel itself is the usual, simple Greek island experience; good sized room with twin beds, a wet room for bathroom and a balcony. There is also a fridge, tea and coffee making facilities, and the essential air con! The rooms are kept spotlessly clean (thank you Dora!) and the view from our balcony was wonderful. Located half way up mount Ainos, most rooms over look the sea and the pool. The pool is lovely, and kept very clean by George. Generally easy to get sun beds too. In two weeks we only found one day when people arriving late morning struggled to get beds. Most days there were only a handful of people around the pool. Make sure you order one of Jenny’s milkshakes! Yum!
Gregory does the best lunches around, you don’t need to leave the pool bar. He’s a brilliant chef. The pasta, Souvlaki, the burgers, it’s all so good. And big! The food and drinks are also very reasonably priced. It’s only a shame that they don’t do evening food as we’d never have left the Hotel!!
There are, however, a handful of good restaurants in walking distance which we frequented. For a special meal try The Olive Lounge. Liana is amazing, as is the food and service. We also loved Gerfiri (also known as The Bridge), Andromeda, and Lorraine’s Magic Hill. I would suggest booking for most of these as they’re very popular. Afrodites is also a lovely family run place for a meal. For a cheaper meal but one of the best souvlaki around, check out The Souvlaki House. Around 20€ will get two of you plenty of food and drinks.

Although Olympic do some good tours (speak to the rep) we found two tours which we booked independently. Both were fabulous. We took a wine tour with Julia from kefaloniawinetour.gr
We would very much recommend this. Julia picks you up from the hotel and takes you on a very personal tour of her own family’s wine yard, including a lovely traditional Greek mezze, followed by tastings at two other wineyards. It was a really interesting and fun 4 hours and fantastic value for money. I think Julia takes up to six people at a time but it was just the two of us.

We also did a day on Danny and Lisa’s yacht with iraklissailing.com Again a very personal experience (there were 9 of us on board) and a great day on the water. Food and drinks are provided (and it’s goooood food!) whilst Danny sails the coastline around Lourdas etc stopping for swims and exploring. Nothing more relaxing than sailing! And not at all expensive. Highly recommend them.
To get around we hired a car from Tatos at Easy rentals. We’ve used them before and they are very reasonable and friendly. They are located just long the Main Street.

No doubt we will go back to Maria Anna, we fell in love with it six years ago and always meet the nicest people there. Every year we leave with email addresses of other guests. It’s a great place to have a chilled out week or two. Thank you, Team Maria Anna for your kindness and hospitality. See You next time!",Date of stay: August 2018,Maria Anna Hotel,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic restaurant!,"We ate here last week after a few people at our hotel in Lourdas recommended it (including the hotel owners). We had been warned to book and were glad we did as it was pretty much full all evening, and they were turning people away.

The food and the service were both fantastic. I had the cheese pies with honey which were incredible, followed by a pizza. My husband had the cheese balls and then the sea bream. Even though we had no room left for more food, we ordered dessert as we’d heard how good they were - I had the baclava and my husband the walnut cake. Incredible! Everything was wonderful. One of the best meals we’ve eaten in Kefalonia, and this is our fourth visit. They also gave us limoncello with our bill, which was a lovely touch. The view of the mountains behind is also very nice.

Some people have mentioned the cats being an issue. We really didn’t find that at all. All tavernas have some cats around, it’s just the way it is, but the couple we saw did not beg, they simply moved on to the next table if they weren’t offered a titbit. Certainly don’t let it put you off. You’ll find the same thing in most restaurants in Greece.

Anyway, can’t recommend this place highly enough. And we’ll be attempting to go back this week before we leave (if we can get a table!).",Date of visit: August 2018,Gefiri Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great fun and lovely staff!,"We decided to hire a peddle boat for 45 minutes for €20 to kill some time whilst waiting for a bus back to Lourdas. The guy was lovely, giving us water bottles for our little adventure and we very much enjoyed a peddle around the lagoon. When it was time to head back in, he offered us another half an hour “as a gift” as it was quiet. We happily took him up on that! When we came back in he gave us a fridge magnet.
Really good fun and lovely staff. And in the strong afternoon heat it was nice and cool out on the lagoon (The is cover over the peddle boats to protect from the sun).
Would definitely recommend.",Date of experience: August 2018,Argostoli Lagoon Activities,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Wonderful find,"My husband found this traditional little Greek restaurant on Trip Advisor when we were looking for a lunch spot on a day out in Argostoli. It’s not the easiest place to find but once you know it’s down an alley way opposite the Shell garage you’ll spot it quite easily. It’s fantastic. Full of Greeks having their lunch - always a good sign, they do good, hearty Greek dishes, home cooked food and all at very reasonable prices. The food is delicious. We had a fantastic lunch and would return in a heart beat. They close at 5pm though so only good for lunch. Highly recommended.",Date of visit: August 2018,Tzivras Restaurant 1933,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Superb!,"We spent a wonderful couple of hours at Felix yesterday. My husband and I met up with a couple of dear friends for lunch and it really couldn’t have been more perfect. From the moment we arrived the staff were amazing; helpful, friendly and attentive. And the food was fabulous. I’m not actually a big fish fan so was a little concerned there wouldn’t be much choice for me but I was wrong. Plenty to chose from. I had the most beautiful piece of steak (and it was huge too!) along with some black tiger prawns. It was delicious. All four of us felt the food, the service and the ambience was excellent and before leaving we rebooked for early May.
Absolutely great, can’t recommend it highly enough.",Date of visit: March 2018,Felix Seafood Grill,4,"Billericay, United Kingdom"
Wonderful place to stay!,"We had the most lovely 5 days staying at the Mill Inn a couple of weeks ago. We had stayed before, about 8 years earlier and fell in love with the pub. On subsequent return visits to The Lakes we often popped in for a pint but had mostly been staying in B&Bs in Caldbeck. This time our favourite place wasn’t available so we decided to give the Mill Inn another go. We weren’t disappointed! It’s cosy and friendly, and very reasonably priced. The staff are fantastic (all of them!), and Dave and Sharon couldn’t do enough for us. The food is good and the whisky selection is vast – both of which made me very happy! We had a lovely room, room 6. Huge bed and a bathroom with a bath and shower. It overlooks the front of the pub but it’s so quiet and pretty all around, it doesn’t matter that it’s not a mountain view (which some rooms have). It’s in a lovely location, just 15 mins drive from Keswick, and there are some nice walks straight out of the pub (we would definitely recommend Bowscale Tarn. Fairly easy walking with amazing views and a beautiful tarn at the top.)

We will definitely be back to stay again. Just need to learn not to eat too much for dinner and save space for the delicious full English breakfasts next time!",Date of stay: February 2018,The Mill Inn,4,"Mungrisdale, United Kingdom"
Fabulous day out on the sea!,"Had the most wonderful day out yesterday with Danny and Lisa on their beautiful yacht. Fantastic sailing and swim stops, and a very tasty lunch - thank you Lisa. Very relaxed and welcoming, the whole day was perfect from start to finish. We were very lucky to share the trip with a lovely family of five, who were lots of fun to spend the day with.
We discovered Iraklis Sailing by accident. Our only regret is that we leave on Sunday, otherwise we would have rebooked for next week! Perfect way to see a bit of the island and relax in luxury for a day. Highly recommend this day out and great value for money.",Date of experience: August 2017,IraklisSailing,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely!,"We had a very lovely meal here last week. The service and staff are excellent and the food was delicious. I had one of the best fillet steaks I've had for a long time. The views are quite stunning too. It was a little quiet when we first got there and we were concerned the ambience might not be great, but soon got busier. The couple at the next table at three (very well behaved) small boys and staff were extremely welcoming of the children.
Lovely restaurant. If we had more time we would definitely have returned.",Date of visit: August 2017,Andromeda Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
One of our faves,"We always like to visit Cafe Platanos when we're in Lourdas. It's the perfect stop for a coffee on the walk down to the beach from our hotel. It's a quirky place, which sells groceries as well as serves drinks. It's a very beautiful spot, with a small balcony area overlooking a ravine which leads down to the sea. Very tranquil. We've only ever had coffee but that's always great. The Welsh gentleman who owns the cafe is always so lovely and welcoming.
It's a bit of a hidden treat but worth looking out for.",Date of visit: August 2017,Cafe Platanos,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Beautiful B&B with the perfect hosts,"From the moment we pulled into the driveway we were greeted with the warmest of welcomes. Dilys, possibly the friendliest Black Lab I've ever met (!), came bounding over, ball in mouth, ready for a stroke and a cuddle. She was soon followed by Anne and Tim, our hosts, full of smiles and offers of a cup of tea. We immediately felt at home.

The house is stunning, and Anne and Tim keep the gardens beautiful, working tirelessly most days we were there. Our room (well, suite) was perfect. At the top of a rather grand staircase, the double room is large, comfortable and overlooks the garden and a lovely field, which whilst we were there was full of Spring lambs. There is a large chest of drawers and a closet, and a mini fridge is kept stocked with fresh milk and bottled water, with space for a few extra bits. So useful. There are facilities to make a much needed cuppa after a day out on the Fells, and plenty of tea options to choose from. There is TV, although we didn't use it much.
Anne and Tim also leave plenty of useful information in the room, with local walks, attractions, and places to eat.
With the double room comes a smaller twin room which was great for us, as it meant I had somewhere to sit and read in the mornings whilst my husband was still sleeping. The bathroom is also a good size, with a large bath (which we both loved!) and a very spacious power shower. The toilet is, very helpfully, a separate room.
But what sets this B&B a notch above the rest, are Anne and Tim. They are the most wonderful hosts, very happy to give advice about the area, walk options, and all things local. We loved our chats with them over the fantastic breakfasts they provide (make sure you try the sausages!!) It really felt more like staying with family than in a B&B, and we were sad to leave after our 5 days with them. But we will definitely be returning. And the gorgeous Dilys dog was the icing on the cake for a dog lover like me! Thank you, Anne and Tim, for making our week so special.

p.s. The local pub, The Oddfellows Arms, is great for dinner, but we thoroughly recommend also visiting The Old Crown in Hesket Newmarket. It's a cute little co-operative pub, very friendly, good beer and fantastic food. There is a lovely walk from the house to the pub, which Anne and Tim can explain to you!",Date of stay: April 2017,The Old Rectory,4,"Caldbeck, United Kingdom"
Love it!,"This is the perfect little chilled bar that there should be far more of in London. Tony keeps the place in tip top shape, serving great cocktails and good wine. Expect it to be busy at certain times of the day (because it's that good) but it's worth it. A classy joint reminiscent of a cute New York wine bar. Small but perfectly formed. Say hi to Tony when you're there. Always welcomes his guests with a smile and some banter.",Date of visit: February 2017,Augustus Harris,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Gorgeous if naughty!,What a lovely little find! We discovered it by accident when visiting the Farm Shop (which is opposite and also fab). We had an amazing hot chocolate and bought some lovely homemade fudge. The ladies who served us were lovely and couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. Definitely worth popping in for a hot chocolate and some naughty sugary goodies!,Date of experience: October 2016,The Chocolate Deli,4,"Little Walsingham, United Kingdom"
"Great food, lovely staff",Can't really fault this place. We had a spontaneous meal in there last night. The food was absolutely lovely and the staff a delight. I can highly recommend the madras. Gorgeous! Nice vibe and cost surroundings. Highly recommended.,Date of visit: October 2016,Black Lion Hotel Restaurant,4,"Walsingham, United Kingdom"
A real gem!,"I can only reiterate the words of the previous reviewer - this restaurant is really wonderful. Fine food, great service and a lovely ambience.

My husband discovered it recently and booked us in to their Cowboy night last Thursday. As soon as we walked in Adrian greeted us and took us to the bar. They have a really good selection of drinks. I was driving so I got stuck into some lovely cream sodas. Made a real change from the boring coke or water! I particularly enjoyed the non-alcoholic Butterscotch Beer.

We had pre-ordered our steaks so once we took our table and ordered our starters there wasn't a long wait for food to start arriving. It was all fantastic. My husband had the beef chilli to start which was gorgeous, and I can certainly vouch for the Chilli Poppers. Then the steaks arrived. Very large and beautifully cooked. No need for any sauce! Some of the best meat we have ever tasted. Home fries and bacon beans and 'shrooms which came with the steaks were also lovely. We were so full after the main course, but somehow we managed to find space for a shared Texas Mess (best variant on Eton Mess we've ever had!) At the end of our meal, Adrian, the owner, chatted to us about the meat, the recipes and travel. It was a fantastic evening in a warm, welcoming and cosy little restaurant. Thanks so much to Adrian, Martin the chef, and Lauren who served us.

I would highly recommend this place. We will be going back very soon!",Date of visit: September 2016,Gallacher's Smokehouse Bar and Grill,4,"Leigh-on Sea, United Kingdom"
Wonderful hotel!,"We have just returned from staying for two weeks at Akti Olous and had a fabulous time.
The hotel is located on the water’s edge just a few minutes’ walk from the centre of Elounda. It has been refurbished to a very high standard (we were surprised that it is only 3 stars), and even though the rooms are on the small side, they are lovely. Our room on the third floor had a fabulous ‘side sea view’ of the bay and looked out across to Spinalonga which was wonderful. The balcony, though small, is the perfect spot for an early morning beer and people watching. However, if you want to me more sociable, the bar on the roof, ‘Sky Bar’, offers fantastic views across the bay. Harry, the resident Mixologist is the perfect host. He made us feel very welcome from the moment we walked through the door. Throughout our holiday he always there for a chat and a laugh. He even planned a one day tour of east Crete for the day we had booked a car! (which turned out to be fab!) And of course he makes a fantastic cocktail (often with his own twist!) The atmosphere in the Sky Bar is very friendly and relaxed. We met some lovely people there on our holiday.

The pool is a little small for the size of the hotel, so sun beds can be limited but the hotel has a little beach at the front so there is always somewhere to sunbathe. There is also a nice little beach a few minutes’ walk towards the peninsula if you want a change.
Breakfast is a good selection of buffet items, from cooked English, to Continental (meats/cheese/croissant, etc), and cake, Greek yoghurt, toast, fresh orange juice, coffee, tea, etc. There’s certainly plenty of choice. Breakfast runs from 7.15 – 10.15am and although I don’t think we made it down before 9am most days, there was always plenty of food which was being constantly replenished. We would also definitely suggest trying the restaurant at the hotel, Blue Sea. The food and service are great, and you might even get to have your dinner on the jetty on the beach!

The staff at the hotel were, without exception, great. From Yiannis (the night manager?) who greeted us when we arrived at 3am, to the other Receptionists, and the bar/restaurant staff – particularly Maria who brought us our vanilla milkshakes with caramel syrup (!) most afternoons! And of course, Harry at the Sky Bar. All were very friendly and helpful. The cleaning lady was lovely and we found she cleaned our room at roughly the same time each day which worked well for us. There were always clean towels and shower mats, and the room was spotless after the cleaners had been.
The rooms have a very good aircon unit but you do have to pay extra for this, which I think is fairly standard. It is worth it though – it was very effective! You also have to pay extra for the same (ours was in the closet) but we didn’t bother. I left ipads, cameras, passports in our room and never had an issue, but the safe is there if you want it.

We would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be returning. It made our stay in Elounda perfect.

Some little tips:
Bus to Plaka or Agios Nikolaos goes from near the chemist, just along from Euro Market, at the back of the hotel. Taxis go from Elounda Square and are about 8 euros to Plaka and about 14 euros to Ag. Nik.
There is a great little laundry opposite the Euro Market called Lol’s Laundry. We found it a life-saver. They do a great job and charge a very reasonable amount.
Try the Grill House just across from Euro Market. They do fabulous gyros, the staff are wonderful and it’s so cheap. They also deliver (to hotels as well as private addresses). The name is only on the front in Greek but they are called Salonikios.
If you want to go to the more popular restaurants along the water’s edge between the hotel and Elounda town centre, you might have to book. We particularly liked Lotus Eaters (Daniel is a fantastic host), Ferryman, and Olondi (look out for Ninos, the little white dog!) The bar next door to Olondi (I think it’s called Mediterranean Café is also very good and reasonably priced)
Ask Harry (the barman at the Skybar at the hotel) if you need any advice – he’s fantastic and a font of all knowledge!
Stacey the Jet2 rep was extremely friendly and helpful even though we didn’t book via Jet2. We booked a tour through her and she gave us some great local advice.
If you forget a beach towel, they sell them, and just about everything else at the very friendly Euro Market at the back of the hotel.
We hired a car from Elounda car hire which is a few minutes’ walk from the hotel (on either the sea front or the street behind). They were reasonably priced and delivered/collected the car from the hotel.
It can be very windy in Elounda. Get pegs to clip your towel to your sunbed from Euro Market.",Date of stay: August 2016,Elounda Akti Olous Hotel,4,"Crete, Greece"
Lovely gyros!,One of our favourite little places in Elounda. Loved it. And it's so cheap!! The staff are so friendly and the food so tasty.,Date of visit: August 2016,Salonikios Grill,4,"Crete, Greece"
Make sure you book!,"This is a fantastic restaurant! It was our favourite when we visited Elounda recently. Daniel, the owner, is a fantastic host. The food is wonderful, the service is great, and the view is gorgeous. It's quite small and always gets booked up, so make sure you book in advance. It is well worth it. They have the best pitta and humus in Elounda! We went twice in a week and would have returned again if we had had more time. Highly recommend this place.",Date of visit: August 2016,Lotus Eaters Restaurant,4,"Crete, Greece"
Lovely food and lovely view,This was another of our favourite restaurants when we visited Elounda recently. The food was excellent. My husband had fish (Bream I think) and most impressed that the chef actually brought the food to the table. And it was his favourite fish of the holiday. It is very popular so book to be sure of a table. Lovely staff too.,Date of visit: August 2016,Ferryman Taverna,4,"Crete, Greece"
Gorgeous restaurant,"This was the restaurant at the hotel at which we stayed. We ate there twice in two weeks, and chose to spend the last night of our holiday there. We weren't disappointed. We had a table on one of the little platforms on the edge of the beach/in the water. It was gorgeous. The food is lovely. Watch out for Tony, the cheeky waiter - he's fantastic!",Date of visit: August 2016,Blue Sea Restaurant,4,"Crete, Greece"
Lovely food but pricey,"We had the most delicious meal here. The food is excellent, and the location is stunning. However, it was, we felt, a little over priced. It was our most expensive meal of our holiday. We (two of us) ordered a reasonable amount of food but by no means excessive and it was over €100 with just one beer each. That's why we can only give it 4 stars, not 5. But food is great.",Date of visit: August 2016,Ergospasio Restaurant,4,"Crete, Greece"
Cool spot in the heart of Midtown,"This hotel is great. It has a beautiful lobby, and the bars are cool and quirky. It's ideally located on 58th, just off 8th Av, so ten minutes from the theatre district. There is a subway at the end of the street at Columbus Circle, and it's very easy and cheap to jump in a cab up 8th if you're having dinner/drinks down in the restaurant area around the forties.
The rooms are not the biggest - we stayed in a standard the first night, which was very small. BUT, we hardly spent any time in it so it really didn't matter, and it was very lovely, despite the size. The double deluxe was perfectly fine for us (we spent 3 nights in one) The rooms are quiet - we heard nothing from other rooms at all.The staff are lovely, and very helpful. In fact, I would say that their customer service is second to known in my experience. We would absolutely stay there again. If you're on a bit of a budget it's a great option. The library bar (or the cow bar as it become known between us - you'll see why it you visit!) was fab. Really lovely little bar and a lot quieter on a Friday night than the main bar (we're a bit too old for that level of music!). Oh, and the beds are amazing!
Loved this place. Will be returning soon.",Date of stay: March 2016,Hudson New York,4,"New York City, New York"
Wonderful meal,"Tonight we thought we'd try the latest addition to Billericay High Street. My husband and I are both bug fans of Thai food and having spent a bit of time in Thailand are not easily pleased. But I am delighted to say we had a lovely experience at the Giggling Squid this evening. We had booked and were immediately seated in a lovely spot. Throughout the evening the service was impeccable, the staff lovely, and the food beautiful. We couldn't fault it at all. We will definitely be returning - frequently! Highly recommend this restaurant.",Date of visit: September 2015,Giggling Squid Billericay,4,"Billericay, United Kingdom"
Second visit and still as fabulous!,"We stayed here in 2012 and had a wonderful time (my previous review is here somewhere) so we decided to return this August. I am delighted to report it was as wonderful as ever. Jenny and Gregory are the most welcoming hosts and Angelo is the best barman around. As before, we felt part of the family instantly. It may technically be only 2 1/2 stars but it is so much more. Rooms are kept spotlessly clean by the marvellous Dora, and the pool is cleaned to the highest standard every morning. There are always plenty of good quality sun beds for everyone and the bar is a shady respite from the sun. With views of Mount Ainos in one direction and the ocean with Zante in the distance in the other, you really can't ask for much more. And the icing on the cake is that it just seems to attract the nicest people. We met so many lovely folk, some of whom we will keep in touch with. So many people said to me that it was the most relaxed they've been in a long time. It really is a little bit of paradise. We will definitely be returning (again!) p.s. If you go, make sure you have lunch there - Gregory is the most wonderful chief. I recommend the Pasta Neopolitain!",Date of stay: August 2015,Maria Anna Hotel,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Lovely bar with lovely owners,Great spot for a beer or two with amazing views of across the sea towards Zante. Also show the major football games which kept my husband happy! Lovely spot and the British owners are very friendly and accommodating. One of our favourite places for an evening pint.,Date of visit: August 2015,Bar 360,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fabulous!,"We didn't book, which was nearly a mistake. It was very busy when we arrived but the manager/owner (I presumed to be Matthew), quickly found us a table. Immediately we were taken with the intimate, friendly and relaxed atmosphere. It is small and homely, which makes the evening feel rather special - a bit like you're at a private exclusive dinner party. It was a mixed crowd, including some very well behaved children, older couples, young families, a younger couple, and a couple of groups of friends - it is clearly a place which appeals to all and I can see why. Everyone seemed to be wholeheartedly enjoying their meals. The menu caters for all tastes, the food is very much 'home-cooked', plentiful, very well presented and tastes amazing. There is a really selection of wine and beer too. I can personally recommend the goats cheese and Parma ham parcels, and the steak frites. Both were wonderful. Matthew serves with a joke and a smile, and is very accommodating. The whole evening was perfect, and was easily the best meal we had all week (and there was some stiff competition!)
Highly recommend this place. Next time we would book to avoid possible disappointment as I couldn't bear building myself up to another visit to find they were full. Warning: food envy is inevitable! What ever you choose, be prepared to also want what the people at the next table have as well. It all looked SO good.
Thank you, Matthew, for a special evening",Date of visit: February 2015,Matthew's Bistro,4,"Ambleside, United Kingdom"
"Lovely pub, lovely meal, lovely people","Staying in the local area for a few days this week, we have been looking for country pubs to eat in, and came upon the Outgate Inn. We popped in the day before to see what sort of menu they offered and were welcomed by the very friendly landlord, so we booked for the following evening.
We had a lovely meal at the Outgate. There was plenty of choice, the meals were generous in size, tasted great and were very nicely presented. They were also piping hot, which isn't always a given these days! All of the staff were extremely accommodating with everyone in the pub, and with a log fire burning, it was a warm, cosy evening.
We wouldn't hesitate to return and to recommend to others. Although we didn't have any, FYI - they welcome dogs, kids and muddy boots!",Date of visit: February 2015,Outgate Inn,4,"Hawkshead, United Kingdom"
One of our faves!,"Whenever we return to the Lake District, we always visit Hawkshead, if nothing else for afternoon tea at Minstrels. They do a wonderful afternoon cream tea which a must! It is a cosy little shop, quite old fashioned, quaint and quirky, with very friendly staff. I find Hawkshead a little too touristy generally but Minstrels is one place we will always return to.",Date of visit: February 2015,Minstrels Gallery,4,"Hawkshead, United Kingdom"
