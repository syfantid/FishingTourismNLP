Fishing trip with Yiannis and Nancy,"We can fully recommend a day fishing with Yiannis and Nancy. What a lovely couple who makes you feel at home on board on their fishing boat. Itâ€™s fun, learning and enjoyable. The food was so tasty and of course the fish was so fresh while we had just pulled them out of the water.",Date of experience: September 2019,Samos Fishing Trips,5,"Samos, Greece"
