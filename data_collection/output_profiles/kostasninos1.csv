Best fishing tour in milos!,"The trip was the best in Milos! We started at 10 in the morning and we went to collect the nets with fresh fish. After we went to poliegos at very nice places that we stopped to swim. Also the crew had traditional food. We also eat the fresh fish that we caught in the morning. Andreas and Marios were the best crew , very polite and nice company! This trip was the best adventure in Milos and we advise it!",Date of experience: July 2018,Milos Poseidon Boat Fishing & Tours,5,"Milos, Greece"
