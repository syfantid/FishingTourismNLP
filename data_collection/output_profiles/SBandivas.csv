Your the Best Adamastos Hotel!,"We stayed here in Adamastos Hotel last July 17-28 during our summer vacation. The room is perfectly clean. The hotel is just walking distance to the most popular red beach and water taxi to white and black beach. It's a very relaxing hotel far away from crowded place. You can sleep well on the night time. Also a walking distance from caldera view, light house and the Venitian castle of Santorini. After a long day outside we come home and relax in the swimming pool. Så my son enjoyed so much. Plus with irini who is so helpfull and approachable. My Family really loved ur hotel and the way you guys treat us!... I will surely come back and stayed in your hotel.",Date of stay: July 2017,Adamastos Hotel,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Unforgetable Experience,"My Family and I really enjoyed our fishing with #Giorgarosfishingtour. We really have had a great memories on our fishing tour. Captain Anthi and the Crew was so nice and helpfull. They always comporting me if i am afraid of the waves.

I really though that fishing is so boring just like here in Denmark but #Giorgarosfishing prove me wrong. They combine it with excitement and enjoyment. I was so amaze when i saw the big octopos, stingrays, shrimps and different types of fish.

After done fishing we went near in the black beach. While the crew make food (the one we caught) my husband is enjoying snorkling in clear, clean and green water, that make us jealous with my son because we don’t know how to swim. Since my son and i dont know how to swim we just enjoy ourself fishing using the fishing rod and we caught some fish.

After the crew finish making the food. We ate all together and while eating we talks a lot of things about fishing. Seriously! Mohammed make tasty food. My Family and I really LOVED the food they make and it really tasty.

After we ate. While the crew prepared for the fishing net we are relaxing and enjoying the MOST FAMOUS SUNSET IN SANTORINI before going back to Port.

Our fishing moment is worth to keep!
