"OK but no ""foreign"" cards expected","I used to work regularly in Paris and have come here few times a year for last seven years or so and have noticed a decline in quality.

Last visit was January 2020. Its just off the champs elysee and I still love its more traditional feel compared to the very touristy restaurants on the main areas.

We were there on a Tuesday night and just a few people there. Food was served quickly, was hot and was OK but I don't think as good as previous years. Similarly although the same man front of house the service has gone down too

To top it off they don't accept foreign cards so had to go and pay cash. They claim ts well signed but it's an A4 sized chalk board behind the bar you don't see when entering a restaurant. There must be a reason why but we had a loaded euro debit card, a HSBC debit card, a HSBC mastercard but none of which were seen as being a French Credit card. A shame as I won't go back now for that reason alone and neither will others no doubt in today's cashless world.",Date of visit: January 2020,Le Châteaubriand,4,"Paris, France"
"Good hotel, excellent service","I have just checked out after a one night business meeting. As a Brit that travels a lot I often am embarrassed at how poor service is in UK hotels but this was a great hotel.

I arrived at 10am to a smile from Loretta who was ever so helpful - they even had my room ready and between that everyone was friendly in the bars and restaurants. Michael on check out was also excellent who made the check out process efficient whilst being friendly and interested in me.

As for the hotel, its decent enough. Old and signs of showing age (old marble etc in bathrooms) , however exceptionally clean and comfortable

Will be back.",Date of stay: November 2019,Radisson Blu Edwardian Heathrow Hotel,4,"Hayes, United Kingdom"
Fantastic stay in Katelios,"We are just returning from a fantastic stay here and wanted to review it whilst we sat delayed in departures!

Firstly we paid just under 400 pound at start of June for one week B and B as I often think reviews are linked to perceived value. Obviously that's quite cheap as out of holiday season

However, we were advised that by the end of the week they were fully booked. However, you'd never know as due to the layout of the grounds it's the most peaceful holiday I've ever been on. We stayed in a Superior apartment which was pleasant and all rooms looked down the hill the resort is set on.

The pool is lovely and even though it was full there was always a lot of sun beds spare around the lovely pool area.

The staff were fantastic and it really felt like being part of their family. I loved the fact their kids swam in the pool and played and you got a feeling it really was their home too.

Food was great too but the evening food was much better than breakfast. We did the bbq which was amazing! Breakfast was fine but compared to everything else probably the only average bit

Beer was 3.80 for a large draft which was probably in line with the resort. But in Kefalonia you will find drinks are what add to the bill (unless you drink house wine which is about 4 euro a half litre)

Location wise we loved it. It was set up a hill and a few hundred metres from a shop and about a kilometre to the small sea front and lovely restaurants. It's up a hill which is manageable but may take it out of you in the heat.

All in all we loved it and could not recommend more highly. I'm amazed it's not more than three stars with Thomas Cook",Date of stay: June 2019,Pacifae Golden Village,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Superb meal and excellent service by Christopher and team,"On our first night here seven days ago, as I looked at trip advisor a man in the bar said 'don't bother. All the restaurants in katelios are good and all the same. Same price. Same quality.'

Until tonight is agree with that statement as we have had some great meals this week in Captain Jerry, Katelios Taverna and Maria's

Tonight we went to Cozy and it was a different level. From the moment we arrived Christopher was excellent in attending to us and recommending food which was all delicious. We both had the special and the food was as it states 'creative Greek cuisine'. Portions were still very generous but when they arrived they all looked great.

It wasn't much more expensive either. House wine was 7.90 for 75 cl and good (compared to about 4 euros for 50cl elsewhere) and our mains were around the 12-13 Mark compared with ten.

Total bill came to sixty euros and I would not have battered an eyelid if it had said much more!

Shame we discovered it on the last night but the perfect memory of kefalonia",Date of visit: June 2019,Cozy,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic day - highly recommended,"Just returned from a fantastic day with Efi and Dimitrios. We had a fantastic welcome and I can't recommend highly enough.

We wanted to do something a bit different to a standard island cruise and this was perfect. They have a well equipped traditional fishing boat with lots of seating. The first couple of hours were spent reeling their nets in that had been put out the night before and seeing what was caught. Some of this was also a fantastic lunch. Definitely the best meal of our holiday! Also included were drinks and we also had two or three nice long stops for a swim and relax on beaches only accessible by boat.

A definite five stars and if we come back to kefalonia again we'll do it again!",Date of experience: June 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Excellent stay in the heart of Venice.,"Personally I rate against value so I shall start by saying I stayed in January and had an absolute bargain stay here at just under £50 a night here including breakfast for both of us.

I would happily have paid a lot more as the stay was excellent. If you follow the map they provide, finding the apartment was easy and we were greeted with a smile and warm welcome. We were in the red room which was relatively spacious and very clean and comfortable

As others have said, breakfast in the room was a nice way to start the day and the black out shutters mean you can get a great night's sleep.

Situated a stones throw from St Marks Square and a few minutes walk to Rialto the location is great.

Only comment I would say as an improvement was the bathroom being a bit tatty. Quite a bit of mould around shower edge and the toilet flush, although working, was pretty loose off the wall

Would highly recommend though",Date of stay: January 2019,Ca' della Loggia,4,"Venice, Italy"
Could be good. Should be good. Is not good.,"I am not one to give bad reviews but on this occasion want to be honest of my experiences here. I have now stayed here twice and it has consistently disappointed.

I travel to Manila quite a bit with work so have stayed in a wide range of hotels of different price points so am not making a rash comment.

AS my title suggests, although a bit dated, this hotel should be good. You are in a good location, it's connected to a mall, the rooms are actually quite spacious yet here i am vowing i will never, ever come back here as i sit in room 1117

They are so close to being good. However, behind all the smiling, welcoming faces they do forget that actually service is what all us guests want.

I can explain a few examples which makes me feel this hotel is relatively lousy;
1) I stayed here in January and was over a weekend and in this area there are not many hotels with outdoor spaces and a pool. The Edsa Shang is delightful but I was interested in trying something different. So having carefully reviewed website i turn up and find it is all under green netting and a building site - this point is not per se fault of this specific hotel but their marketing team. So I had a chat and the team were very apologetic.
2) That trip my luggage did not arrive. The front desk were great. They gave me some essentials and said they would look after the dealings with KLM to make sure it got here. Genuinely they were great. But then, the small things make a difference. I arrive in from work at 2am and ask if it has arrived yet (as it was expected at midnight) They said no so i said, no problem i am off to bed I will come down tomorrow. At 3.30am I get a call in my room. I was fast asleep. They advise me I have it. I was peeved but polite saying i will come and get it tomorrow. Ten minutes later door on room rings with it!! All the good work undone.
3) On returning here in April, I thought I would give them a go so mailed their Facebook team asking if the outdoor space work was completed. I have the message from them saying yes it is all complete so booked. It is not complete so the outside space is not enjoyable. Again, more marketings fault but ultimately a driver why i dont want to stay here again.
4) Breakfast - an utter shambles most mornings. There are so many staff wandering around yet on the times i eat there there seems to always be no glasses for juices. They have a great eggs station yet even when they have no orders and i gave them the piece of paper with mine on, fifteen minutes later i have no omelette and they have lost it.
5) Wifi - A ""business"" hotel, yet the wifi utterly sucks. If you plan to work in your room and make skype type calls or expect your Outlook to sync, go out to dinner whilst it does it. No that is not a Manila issue as a cheaper hotel fifty metres away had great wifi earlier that week!!
6) I made this complaint and they were quite apologetc. I have sent the screenshot from facebook and then that day the manager had left the company on maternity and noone knew of my complaint. The next day i explain it again and send e-mail to someone else. No courtesy reply back to confirm they are on it.

As I say, all small things but therein lies the issue. Everyone smiles at you and makes you feel welcome. But behind the smiles and nice people the service when there are issues is not there and for that reason there are many other hotels within a few hundred metres that very much exceed this one.

My advice, if you can get a good rate on Hotel.com or equivalent and book the Shang if you have some budget. If not places like Citadines a few metres away are cleaner, more modern and better pool, facilities (and cheaper - although Citadines breakfast is pretty dire so you would need to go next door to Coffee Bean company for a good coffee and breakfast each morning)",Date of stay: April 2018,Crowne Plaza Manila Galleria,4,"Luzon, Philippines"
Beautiful evening meal,"Just back from a beautiful evening meal at The Riverside. It was a Monday night in march (after the snow) so not busy but the meal was faultless and a credit to the chef.

Lots of interesting items on the menu but something there for everyone. Will be returning if in the area.",Date of visit: March 2018,The Riverside,4,"Braunton, United Kingdom"
A home from home in a beautiful location,"Just leaving Littletown after a fantastic weekend in the lakes.

A fantastic welcome received on arrival in this working farm set in the foothills of the Newlands Valley.

We loved our stay and the breakfast in the morning is fantastic! Served with a smile and fantastic poached eggs!",Date of stay: January 2018,Littletown Farm,4,"Keswick, United Kingdom"
A delight in the midweek heat,"We went to Indian Brasserie on Wednesday night this week in the midst of our 30 degrees heatwave.

As expected as we arrived at 7.30 it was empty but we were greeted with smiles by our waiter and a manager looking chap. They were delightful and instantly made us feel at home. In addition it is air conditioned so was the best place to be whilst others were sat at home moaning it was too hot.

As you'd expect in a quiet restaurant our food was served promptly but it was excellent as always and the service was what made it.

Excellent all round!",Date of visit: June 2017,Indian Brasserie,4,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom"
Great value stay,"Date: May 12-17
Room: 4512

I should start by saying the price I paid as perceived value always influences opinion. I paid 307 all inclusive for a week as organised all elements separately but would happily have paid 5-600 for a week in may. Why?

Room: was spacious, clean and excellent for three friends. We were lucky and had a room overlooking the quieter back pool. (there is a kids pool, main front pool with all entertainment and then a back pool)

Food: I thought the food was great. On a three star all inclusive you can't expect the world and I would say this was excellent canteen food and OK restaurant food. Breakfast was the usual but always lots of fresh fruit, bread (with toaster machines for the brits) and various eggs cooked fresh. Dinner had a theme each day and there was always a salad bar. They had a chef who would cook on a grill meat/fish fresh and over a week it didn't get boring. For those who are more fussy there was a pizza every day and chips!

Entertainment : not exactly great but held in a separate massive function room so could easily escape in one kf the bars

Bar: OK so yes the alcohol was not the best but that's why it's free. You can have a pint of amstel for one euro before six down the road and two euros at full price so it's easy to go out for a night or two.",Date of stay: May 2017,PlayaOlid Suites & Apartments,4,"Tenerife, Spain"
Good stay,"We have just left after a nice three day break in Amsterdam.

Overall it was an excellent stay and great value for money. Room was great and staff were very helpful.

Couple of things to be aware of. As it is a free breakfast and the same model they use worldwide I am not sure they are used to a full hotel like we had for new year! Therefore breakfast was chaos but did seem to improve each day.

Also, they are a two minute walk to train station. It is a twelve euro day return to Amsterdam Central. One thing that I did not realise was that if you want a travel card it won't get you to Hoofddorp. Therefore we didn't get one. If you did want one then the option would be to get the free hotel shuttle to the airport (only five mins and operates every twenty) and use your travel card from there.",Date of stay: December 2016,Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam Airport Schiphol,4,"Hoofddorp, The Netherlands"
Nice meal.,"Busy on a Friday night but were seated in about twenty minutes with no booking

Nice, tasty food. For those in UK very much a zizi or Prezzo type place and similar price.",Date of visit: December 2016,WOODSTONE Pizza and Wine Hoofddorp,4,"Hoofddorp, The Netherlands"
Great service and food at an affordable price,"Went there last night with my colleague and had a lovely meal. The welcome was warm and friendly without being over the top and the food was tasty and affordable.

We let them decide our appetisers and had some lovely bread, octopus, stuffed vine leaves, tsatziki and fried cheese. Delicious. Almost full at that point to be honest!

For our mains we had a Moussaka and stuffed cabbage. Again both excellent and under ten euros.

Very close to our hotel ( metropolitan) and a hundred times more enjoyable experience

Thanks",Date of visit: November 2016,Arsenis Taverna,4,"Paleo Faliro, Greece"
Excellent hotel- service not as good as other shangri-la,"Excellent stay but everything is a slight notch down from other hotels in the chain

Service at breakfast was average with it actually pretty difficult to get a coffee or a refill. My check in process was not brilliant either with the lady walking away before explaining where lifts etc were or giving me my credit card back

Food was excellent and room very comfortable too. Excellent indoor pool and gym facilities",Date of stay: June 2016,"Shangri-La Hotel, Xian",4,"Xi'an, China"
Excellent stay,"Stayed here four nights in a king double room

Excellent room which was spacious with great WiFi and seating area.

Staff could not do any more for you and seemed to be everywhere. One slight negative was noise of main road from room and a fridge that sounded like it was going to take off!",Date of stay: May 2016,Hyatt Place Salt Lake City/Cottonwood,4,"Holladay, Utah"
Delightful,"Having read reviews i was really looking forward to my visit here and was not disappointed

The taster menu was delicious and very well priced and the whole experience was delightful. Definitely will be back",Date of visit: February 2016,East India Cafe,4,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom"
Great food,"I have just got back from eating here and had an excellent meal for 2 people for little over £40 GBP for a bottle of wine, 2 main courses, a side dish and a tiramisu

We did turn up pretty early as had had a long day so were one of the first groups to arrive. At the time of arriving, the family wereeating in the restaurant - which I like to see! However, the waiters quickly came to help us out.

As we had eaten a lot during the day we had no starter. I had a veal main course and my girlfriend had a pasta dish. This was washed down with some red wine followed by tiramisu. An excellent choice to eat in a local family restaurant.",Date of visit: December 2015,Hostaria da Vincenzo,4,"Rome, Italy"
Oh my god.....!,"The first thing I ate on my recent visit to Rome.

Basically, why repeat everything the other people have said. It was delicious. A big queue of locals too at lunchtime and a great snack - I could have stayed all day!",Date of visit: December 2015,Pinsere,4,"Rome, Italy"
My favourite coffee and cake in Cheltenham...!,"I am a big fan of this coffee shop on the Bath Road. It is now firmly established as being one of the best coffee shops in the area and on top of that makes wonderful cakes.

I go every couple of weeks and the choice of cakes is amazing and regularly changes. The best testament to how good this place is that each friend I have recommended it to is also now a regular.

As a side note, it also does great pop up restaurants once a month",Date of visit: December 2015,Brew & Bake,4,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom"
Excellent Stay,"We were looking for somewhere to stay for one night en route to London and this was perfect.

There was a nice, friendly welcome and we paid £75 for 2 of us on a Saturday night including breakfast. We were in room 3 which I think may have been an upgrade to a Superior Room.

The room was clean and the bed very comfortable with nice touches such as a teapot and cafetiere

The bathroom was huge with a great roll top bath. Only minor thing was no soap at the sink but this may have just been an error as the other toiletries provided were great.

Had dinner in the restaurant which was excellent and breakfast was good too, though there was no fresh fruit available as advertised.",Date of stay: October 2015,The White Hart,4,"Stockbridge, United Kingdom"
One word: Superb!,"I am not one to write many Tripadvisor reviews but feel the inclination to with Brew and Bake.

Over the last few months, I have been a regular customer and thoroughly enjoyed the selection of cakes and coffee on other. The Salted Caramel slice is to die for and all my friends I have visited with are now regular customers too which says a lot. Mark and his team are always friendly and helpful and have now also introduced me to their decaffeinated coffee which is the best I have tasted, enhanced by the great décor and free wifi enabling you to work (if you wish!!)

So why the review? Well, the Pop Up restaurant last night sent me over the edge!! This is a monthly thing and I went last night which was excellent. It was excellent restaurant standard food for 3 courses and 20 quid. Being able to take your own drinks makes it even more cost effective for a frugal man like myself!! Each of the 3 courses were excellent and my girlfriend had 3 different ones which were great too. And as for the bread and dips....Mmmmmm.....I could have eaten them all day :-)",Date of visit: September 2015,Brew & Bake,4,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom"
Always enjoy my stay here,"I have stayed here five or six times for work and consider it to be a pretty good all round hotel based on cost, location etc

Wifi is in each room and beds are comfortable and staff helpful. one thing to be aware of is the varying size of rooms. The ""single"" room (I think all the ones ending in 01) is sometimes shared as a small double and is a tight squeeze but all the other ones are good.",Date of stay: April 2015,Royal Hotel Paris Champs Elysees,4,"Paris, France"
Good value - get what you pay for,"I had read a few reviews on here which made me a bit worried about what to expect but was pleasantly surprised by it all.

1) Building and facilities - It is a typical 3 star old European hotel. A little bit dated in areas but it seemed perfectly clean. My room was out the back and quite small but perfectly functional. Some of my larger friends struggled with the size of the shower!

The floating pool was beautiful - just a shame in my stay it rained so much. But with that and the Lido lots of places to sunbathe and swim, even in peak season in August

The terrace bar has outstanding views over the lake and th building really is in the most idyllic place.

2) All Inclusive - The bar has caused some issues on here and I can understand why. On a couple of days (normlly when new arrivals) the bar was busy with a long queue. However, they didn't really mind how many drinks you ordered so I just got 2 at a time. It would however, make so much more sense if they had a serve yourself beer tap or put it in bigger glasses.

3) Food - Again, it was a 3 star all inclusive hotel and I think for that it was good. The problem is a lot of the clientele want old fashioned English food so yes if you have the roast beef it may be a bit chewy. However, the salad bars are excellent with lots of fresh salad and veg. The pizza and pasta bars are fine too. Breakfast is probably the ""weakest"" offering and personally i would like to have seen more fruit.They have tried to cater for the British market and offer bacon, sausages etc but as with all European hotels, naturally it is not quite the same

If food is a concern they do do an All inclusive upgrade which many people were saying was of good quality

All in all I would happily go back. I think they could put wifi in rooms, even at a charge but in general, thoroughly enjoyed it.

Great food at great prices,"We recently attended The Old Rectory for my parents 40th wedding anniversary and the whole experience was perfect.

Within the building there are two very small dining areas which very much have a homely feel than a contemporary restaurant. Each room probably accommodates up to 15 people maximum.

We were welcomed to the restaurant and service throughout the meal was friendly and efficient. As for the food - it was excellent. If you are after a restaurant that serves traditional food very well this really is the one for you. Also it is all off a ""Prix Fixe"" menu which makes going out an easy thing to budget for - particularly when it is only £25 for 3 courses.

Even though it was a ""prix fixe"" menu there were 6 or seven choices for each course. Starters included homely options such as pate, smoked salmon, mushrooms, trout etc and all of them were presented delightfully and tasted great. Also - this is certainly somewhere that does not crimp on portion sizes! The starters were bigger than some main courses you would get in ""haute cuisine"" restaurants!

On to the main courses - again freshly cooked and tasted delicous and not a mouthful left on any of our parties plate!

We just amount squeezes in pudding - ranging from bread and butter pudding to lighter mousses which were a great end to a great meal.

If you want a lovely meal in Cheltenham dont forget about The Old Rectory! Not necessarily a place a group of young people may visit but for family meals and older groups of friends the perfect venue!",Date of visit: September 2012,The Old Rectory Restaurant,4,"Colesbourne, United Kingdom"
