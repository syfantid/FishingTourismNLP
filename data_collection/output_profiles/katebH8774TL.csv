Cute Little Place,"We visited here last week and although it is a small place, it is definitely worth the $5 especially when you know it goes towards helping the rehabilitation of wildlife and other animals. If you venture out the back, there is a short walking trail where there is an observation area. We saw baby alligators, lots of different butterflies and various birds including eagles. If you are in the area, definitely check it out :)",Date of experience: November 2019,Back to Nature Wildlife Refuge,4,"Orlando, Florida"
"Lovely Hotel, Just a Few Points to Note","My partner and I stayed here for a week in June and to be honest I find it very hard to agree with the scathing negative reviews.

Please also do not try to compare this place to a 5* Dubai hotel as they are two completely different things! This is a worthy 4* based on Canarian standards.

Our bungalow was absolutely spotless. Yes there are a few things that could be patched up however the housekeeping lady did an amazing job every day and was lovely the few times we did bump into her (despite our lack of understanding of each others language). We had the one bedroom bungalow which included a living room, kitchenette with hob, microwave and fridge as well as all the crockery and utensils you need (and never use if going AI).

In terms of food, finally we went on an all inclusive holiday where it wasn't repetitive mystery meat in a sauce! There was plenty of selection each meal time and everything we ate we enjoyed. Each night had a different theme (Italian, Spanish, Mexican, Canarian etc.) As for people saying they don't cater for the English, that is absolute rubbish! There was nothing there that you couldn't eat back in the UK. If you want cottage pie and roast dinners then maybe holidays abroad are not for you.

At the pool bar there is a good variety of food if you don't want to go to the restaurant for lunch. This included burgers, hot dogs, chips, chicken nuggets etc along with cheese, cold meats and salad.

The one thing I must say about the food is the BBQ was a huge let down. We booked it 24h in advance and were looking forward to burgers, sausages, chicken etc. What we got was overcooked pork steaks, undercooked sausages, some sort of fish and pork kebabs. The salad variety with the BBQ was also not as good as in the main restaurant. We ate half a plate and left to get food in the restaurant which was miles better.

The bar staff could be a bit happier and friendlier. Maybe only having two behind the bar when the place is fully booked puts a bit of pressure on them? Also please, please, please stop serving pre mixed cocktails from a machine and teach the bar staff how to make proper cocktails! I understand this may be a cost saving measure but the cocktails tasted like fruit juice and nothing else. Please also note that due to the bar being next to the pool, all drinks are served in plastic tumblers.

Sunbeds there are plenty of and they have (and enforce) the no reserving sunbeds before 10am rule which pretty much guarantees you being able to grab one if you want to perch by the pool for the day.

The beach is a 20minute walk away which isn't a problem as the walk is via a nature reserve where you can see a variety of birds.

Entertainment I can't comment on as we sat outside at night but looking at the schedule there were plenty of daytime activities and a different show every night.

Check out is at 12 but 24h before you check out you can book a 1h slot for the courtesy bungalow where you can have a shower and change. Just be aware that this is used by others and the people before you may not leave it in a condition that you would be happy with (used shampoo bottles thrown in the bath and water all over the floor).

In summary, would I recommend? Yes.
Is the food good? Yes, just don't bother with the BBQ.
Are the rooms clean? Yes
Are there cockroaches? Yes of course but not once did any come in our room. You are abroad surrounded by trees and shrubs, there are all kinds of creepy crawlies about.

Fishing Trip,"Had a great day out. Lovely guys on the boat and they were really helpful. All trips include a barbecue which was an added bonus, fresh fish and a Greek salad (yum!). Would definitely recommend :)",Date of experience: October 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Excellent Hotel,"Staff were very welcoming and helpful. Rooms were spotlessly clean. Breakfast was a typical continental however plenty of choice including cold meats and pastries. Good location as close to the metro station with links to the major sights. Overall an excellent experience, good value for money and would recommend as a perfect base for exploring Rome.",Date of stay: July 2016,La Locanda Del Manzoni,4,"Rome, Italy"
Lovely Meal,"My boyfriend and I visited here on 11th June whilst staying over in London. The 4/5 star reviews aren't wrong. We had a lovely meal and were served by lovely staff. We could not believe how quiet this place was on a Saturday night! If you ever stay in London, it is definitely worth the trip away from the centre.",Date of visit: June 2016,Pure Cyprus,4,"London, United Kingdom"
