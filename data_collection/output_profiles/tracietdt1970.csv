Best Fishing trip that I have been on.,"Absolutely amazing experience, my partner and I had very active lines. The Greek salad with our bbq fish made the experience complete after a swim in the very clear sea. The on board fishermen were a joy to spend your time with and always ready to assist and advise. I would recommend this trip over all of the others if you are interested in trying your hand at sea fishing.",Date of experience: October 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Fantastic Activities and a great addition to your Cheshire Ice Cream Farm visit.,"Once again we visited the Candle Workshop and thoroughly enjoyed candle making, sand bottles and model painting. The prices are good and the food is freshly made to order. With the upgrades at the Cheshire Ice Cream Farm I have noticed that the Candle Factory has become a lot quieter but in all honesty this is makes it more of an attraction. We tend to take the children for 10 am to the Ice Cream Farm then when it gets busy we go to the Candle Factory for a more leisurely lunch and different hands on craft.",Date of experience: July 2016,Cheshire Workshops,4,"Higher Burwardsley, United Kingdom"
Beautiful setting and lovely hosts,"The views at Tranna Hill are breath taking, The room was spotless and the beds very comfortable, the whole place is in fact immaculate. The bathroom had a good sized shower and separate bath. Whatsmore the host Brenda, was very warm and helpful, answering question on eating places, to best route to your destinations while you are there.
This was my first visit and I can guarantee that I will return, the location is perfect for so many reasons but myself personally could not get around all that there is on offer in one weekend. I look forward to my return visit.",Date of stay: June 2016,Tranna Hill,4,"Newbiggin-on-Lune, United Kingdom"
"Excellently executed, amazing atmosphere and superb staff.","I can honestly say that I can not fault Delta Force Paintballing @ Manchester. I have read the negative feedback on here, yes you do require extra paintballs to get the maximum enjoyment from your day but for my team it was worth it. The staff were ALL well informed, organised and exceptionally helpful. I approached many of the staff during the day, from marshals to management each and everyone were second to none. Nothing was too much bother and this has made my experience faultless. The following day I asked my group if they would like to do it again and if they would like to try another site. The unanimous response was to return to Manchester as anywhere else would have a hard task to beat the all round experience. The organisation was amazing and impressive to say the least. Start time was as stated in our email received on booking this activity. Times and details contained in the email covered everything we needed to know and I found it to be very accurate.

Excellent rooms,"A delightful hotel, However, I did pay extra for a view of the museum and Central Park but got a window with scaffolding and mesh to look out of. I know they can't help this and this will all be resolved when the building work is complete. My only suggestion would be that they stop charging more for a view they can't provide.",Date of stay: August 2015,Excelsior Hotel,4,"New York City, New York"
