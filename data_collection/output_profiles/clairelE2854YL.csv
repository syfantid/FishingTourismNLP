Always the highlight of our holidays üê†ü•Ç,"This is mine and my boyfriends second time on the fishing tour this year. I can honestly say I wouldn‚Äôt dream of visiting the island without taking this trip. It has been both years the absolute highlight of our holiday!

Efi and Dimitrios greeted us as if we were old friends which was lovely. I was touched they had remembered us from the previous year. They are both clearly very hard working, smiley, genuinely nice people who are eager to please.

I‚Äôm not- unlike my boyfriend hugely into fishing. That said I always very much enjoy this part of the trip. You can be as involved as you like helping untangle the fish from the nets or watch on there is no pressure! There were two young boys on the trip with us aged around 10-12 who thoroughly enjoyed this part of the trip- a fantastic family tour as well as couples!

Following the fishing we were taken over to a lovely beach which was all for us no one else there. There was even natural clay where you could give yourself a free spa treatment! Whilst we relaxed there and swam in the tranquil waters Efi & Dimitrios prepared us a lovely spot of lunch.

Efi did not disappoint with her cooking skills. How she makes such sensational food on one little stove amazes me! She is an extremely talented cook. Definitely one of- if not the best meal we had during our holidays both years. Home made wine is always flowing, lots of beer or soft drinks for children including Efi‚Äôs delicious home made lemonade.

On the way back we stopped and had one last swim (and lots more home made wine)
Before docking back in Katelios harbour around 3pm.

We look forward to seeing you both next year for another fabulous day out on the sea!

Thankyou so much to you both!",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Memories we will never forget!,"Me and my boyfriend booked onto this trip and we weren‚Äôt disappointed. We were immediately welcomed on board by Efi & Dimitrios and given some bread with Efi‚Äôs delicious home made marmalade and coffee before setting sail.

When the fishing nets were pulled in you could get as involved as you wanted to. My boyfriend was happy helping and untangling the fish from the nets however I was just happy watching, either way we both felt involved in the action!

The variety of fish we caught was really interesting and both Efi and Dimitrios are clearly very knowledgable about the local marine life, teaching us all about it. They caught Lobster, Red Snapper, Baracuda, Parrot Fish, Stingwray, Flying Fish and many more.

We were then taken to a beautiful spot with turquoise warm water and a secluded white stone beach. Whilst Efi & Dimitrios prepared us our fish lunch we snorkeled, and chilled in the sun. It was extremely peaceful and tranquil.

The seafood lunch which was prepared was the some of the most delicious food we ate in our whole 10 day holiday. I was expeciting some of the mornings catches to be held back and sold once we docked back in Katelios but absolutely not! There was enough Lobster for 2/3 per person! Everything was home made from scratch by Efi who is an absolute talent cooking us such a feast on one stove. The lunch was washed down with as much of Efi & Dimitrios‚Äôs home made wine as you wanted and it was absolutely delicious!

Efi & Dimitrios are such a welcoming and friendly couple who clearly have a passion for what they do. They were so accomadating and made us feel very at home aboard their boat.

There is no doubt in my mind that we will be visiting Kefalonia for many more years and we will certainly be going on this trip again and again!

Thankyou for such a fabulous trip!",Date of experience: June 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
