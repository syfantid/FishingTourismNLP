Great historical point,"An impressive archeological site with outstanding views.
Lindos is a gorgeous place with a lovely beach... well worth a visit! Reasonably price entrance to site.",Date of experience: October 2020,Acropolis of Lindos,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Fantastic trip,"Extremely enthusiastic couple who obviously enjoy their job and are passionate about their customers having the best possible experience.

A few of us felt sick and they moved to calmer waters, checking everyone was ok.
They had a good knowledge of fishing spots and assisted the less experienced! ( me).
We swam in a beautiful spot, followed by a fabulous meal, plenty of drinks available.
It was my partners 50th birthday and they presented him with a cake which was a lovely touch.
Thank you very much for a great day.",Date of experience: October 2020,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
A great family holiday,"We were booked to go to the Eden apartments but we were changed last minute due to overbooking. Initially we were upset as we had booked a 2 bed apartment and arrived to find a tiny one bed apartment for 2 adults and 3 children. The manager was called and we were promised a new room the next day...by lunchtime we had been moved to a nice large air conditioned one bed apartment: not 2 beds but it had 3 large sofa beds. To be fair the management were really helpful and did everything possible to make us comfortable. The staff were great...from maids to bar staff, all super friendly! The food was really tasty, and good value for money. There were drinks available throughout the day....help yourself! Jamie the entertainer was a great guy, and they had a couple of really good shows. My kids were addicted to Bingo and enjoyed that more than cheesey kids discos! Cons: poor seating arrangements for entertainment, bar/drinks availability stopped at 11 pm before the evening was finished (i only wanted coffee then) . Overall it was a positive experience and we had a fantastic time!",Date of stay: August 2014,Altamadores,4,"Gran Canaria, Spain"
