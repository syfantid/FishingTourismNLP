Worst eating experience,"Even though we made a reservation we had to wait to get seated. Then when they seated us it was not what we asked for. Then the food came 50 mins late. Then to boot when we were still eating the server came with the bill and asked us to pay in the middle of our meal.

Good place to eat,It is hard to give it 3 stars only because I think it is more 3.5 stars than anything. But to give an imbiss 4 stars is not possible.

Good meat,We started our search in the Modena area for some steak. Using trip advisor we first went to a place with BBQ in the name but the area was shady and no one was inside. After extensive searching we found La Plaza. The steak was excellent. I didn't appreciate the live music. One person singing more or less karaoke.

Northern light tour,After a disappointing whale watching event we crossed our fingers and hoped for the best.

Awesome sushi in Germany,I am a regular here due to it being the best sushi place in Germany. Was recommended by a Japanese friend of ours and I have to say worth every penny.

Mother Nature made an ace,Even though when I went was super windy and cold the place was awesome. The lagoon was so relaxing and enjoyable. It was cold outside but in the water was so soothing. We got the premium package with included towels and slippers but the problem was there was no place to put it before entering the water. I suggest finding a place for it where you can get it back. Also prepare a ziplock or something to make you belonging water proof whether you phone for pictures or others,Date of experience: February 2016,Blue Lagoon,1,"Grindavik, Iceland"

2nights 3days of vacation,The hotel was good. We stayed at condo with 3 adults and 2 kids. The room was really well located. The ski slope was right out the steps.
