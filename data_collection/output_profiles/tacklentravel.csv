My favorite Pirate!,"Let me get right to the point and answer your question...YES, YOU SHOULD BOOK THIS EXCURSION. NO, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!

Mikas and his assistant, Adonis (Donnie) picked us up at the cruise port of Santorini. This in it of itself is a huge deal. I have a mobile disability that made it so very difficult to get into the town of Santorini even by cable car. Plus Santorini has steps everywhere so touring the city would have been very hard. The Private Pirate Fishing tour eliminated the worry about those things and still afforded me the opportunity to see and experience the essence of Santorini.

While Captain Mikas showed us some sights and took us to some fishing spots, Donnie made my family feel at home and shared his knowleged about the history and facts of Santorini. Within in minutes of arriving at the fishing point, my husband and daughter both caught barracudas. A few minutes later, my husband caught a tuna. Pirate/Captain Mike immediately went into action to make ceviche with the tuna. Then he took us to the ""Hot Spirings"" so we could take a nice swim while he grilled the barracudas.

By the time we were done swimming, we were famished! Pirate Mikas and Donnie began adorning the table with the feast that they had prepared: ceviche, grilled baracuda with special sauce, tomatoe bread and greek salad. The food was absolutely delicious and of course fresh.

To go along with the great experience, beautiful scenery and wonderful food, we also were embraced like family. Mikas and Donnie are perfectly suited for the services they provide. Professional, authentic, great customer service skills and all-around great guys!

Dreams do come true,"Antonia and Michalis' and crew were absolutely wonderful. First, we were welcomed with huge smiles and warm embraces by Antonia who also baked us a fresh breakfast Vanilla cake (yum). We were then enroute to go take up the nets that they put out the night prior. In my inexperience, I began to get a little nervous about going further out to sea than I had anticipated. Antonia immediately saw my change in demeanor and asked if I would feel better if we anchored at a nearby island instead of collecting the nets. I jumped at that new option. My husband was able to fish while my kids swam at the shallow end of the lagoon and I was able to just relax. Antonia and Michalis created a splendid spread of Lobster, Noodles, Potatoe Salad, Greek Salad and fresh fruit salad for dessert. Many of the ingredients came right from her own farm! They went out of their way to make sure that we enjoyed our excursion even though I was being a scaddie-cat. Lastly, I am a disabled traveler. They were very professional and accommodating towards me although I had a mobility challenge. They got me on and off their boat with no problems! I would recommend them 100% for an unforgettable Kefalonia experience.",Date of experience: May 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Taking It Up Another Notch,"I chose Emeril's New Orleans to celebrate my 50th birthday. Service from the Maitre De to the wait staff was outstanding. Very courteous. It was raining outside so the Maitre De gave me a bag to cover my scooter steering column. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and made genuine conversation with all of his guests. The atmosphere was posh and very conducive to fine dining.

The food was exquisite. It is pricey, however, it is worth it! We left there very happy and full.",Date of visit: July 2018,Emeril's New Orleans,4,"New Orleans, Louisiana"
Get familiar,"Great experience! Parking in New Orleans is very expensive. It was great to leave our car in our hotel's garage while we toured the city. There are many stops to ensure that you can get on/off as close as possible to the sight you want to see. The first day, we did the entire city tour via bus then we highlighted the places that we wanted to visit. We thoroughly enjoyed it. I recommend the multi-day pass for those who are going to be there longer than 2 days.",Date of experience: July 2018,City Sightseeing New Orleans Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Tour,4,"New Orleans, Louisiana"
The Last Royal Governor,The tour guide/interpreter was excellent. The setting is the tale of the last Royal Governor that ruled over Williamsburg. Lots of information and a look into the grandiose lifestyle of the rich and powerful in Colonial Williamsburg.,Date of experience: August 2018,Governor's Palace,4,"Williamsburg, Virginia"
Historical Eats,"The food was good. Few fares that represented foods from history but not as much as King's Arms Tavern. The food was tasty and a bit pricey but worth the experience. Our waitress did not seem to appreciate us as much as she did her other customers but we tried not to take it personally. Overall, it was a great experience for the homeschooling family. Also, for the mobility challenged, there is seating in the garden and accessibility in the back. The front has 3 steps that have to be navigated.",Date of visit: August 2018,Josiah Chowning's Tavern,4,"Williamsburg, Virginia"
History comes alive,"A great place for the entire family to learn about history!! They have made great advances toward accessibility for those with mobility challenges. There are still a few places with limited access. So grab a motorized scooter and your ticket to delve into history. The buses are very convenient. It runs every 10-15 minutes to limit walking.

Be sure to come early to catch all of the re-enactments and tours. The interpreters will stay in character. It is quite amazing. Make sure you visit the hospital and the Governor's Royal Palace. We topped off our visit with lunch at Chowning's Tavern and at ate fare from history. For those who will be visiting Williamsburg for the first time, grab the America's Historic Triangle Ticket to include Jamestown and Yorktown; both great companion tours for the history buff and homeschooling families.",Date of experience: August 2018,Colonial Williamsburg,4,"Williamsburg, Virginia"
More than just roller coasters,"Busch Gardens is a beautifully landscaped theme park and their food will not disappoint. For the disabled visitor, you are able to reserve a motorized scooter online. VERY CONVENIENT!! It lowers anxiety knowing that when you get there, your chariot awaits you and you do not have to worry that you just missed the last one. I am unable to do the park without it! Also, the place to rent the scooter is at the entrance of the park so that you don't have to walk far, unlike some parks that I have been to. Enough about that, the roller coasters were great, along with the customer service. Lots of friendly faces and courteous employees. The shows are fun, lively and very colorful. Our entire group of family and friends had a wonderful time and made splendid memories!!",Date of experience: August 2018,Busch Gardens Williamsburg,4,"Williamsburg, Virginia"
HOLY GOODNESS,Amazing!! Go early and stay until it closes. There are lots of things to learn and see. Great re-enactments and period costumes to keep it authentic. The food was pricey but it was very tasty. The terrace was a nice respite from the walking as well.,Date of experience: August 2018,Museum of the Bible,4,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"
Big Red Bus Tour,"During our last visit to Washington D.C., my family and I decided to tour via the Big Red Bus. It was a fantastic way to see the city without worrying about parking or getting lost. We mapped out the things we wanted to see and made our way to the first stop to catch the bus. Only con for me was that not every bus was wheelchair accessible, therefore, lost precious time waiting in the bus that could accommodate. We ended up missing a few of the museums because of it. However, the staff went out of there way to help me and make up for lost time. Staff was very courteous and had wonderful customer service skills. My advice is to do the two day ticket. One day was just not enough time. Definitely recommend it.",Date of experience: August 2018,Big Bus Tours,4,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"
Never disappoints,"This was our second time staying at Vacation Village at Parkway and once again, we were completely satisfied. Aside from some amenities like complimentary coffee, cream, sugar, shampoo and conditioner, the room was perfect. I always inspect the room for cleanliness and any malfunctioning appliances. Everything was in working order except some spots in the bathroom. The housekeeper came right up to clean it as well as mopping the floor of the entire unit. When traveling with children, a very clean room is a must and they deliver cleanliness each time. Location is fantastic as well. Within a mile of I-4, therefore, you are close to ALL attractions but far away enough away from crowds. International Drive, Premium Outlets and plenty of souvenir shopping within 10 minutes. VIEW: We stayed in building 21 (new building) overlooking the pool, lake and the fireworks from Disney's Epcot. EPIC!! Sit back on your balcony with a fruity beverage and a meal to enjoy fireworks show without the hassle of going out. For the ""Abled Traveler with a Disability"", the units are wide enough to fit your scooter or wheelchair. Depending on the size of your scooter, you may have to move some dining room chairs around for ease of navigation, but otherwise, it was very easy to move around. In addition, building 21 houses the pool, therefore, take the elevator down to the ground floor and head to the back to open the doors to splash-fest. I was able get around throughout the entire Vacation Village property with ease. The only feature I would add is push-button door opening device. Unless I was going in or out the building with someone who could hold the door open, I would have been very hard. No worries with families with small children. The balcony is fully enclosed with screening making it very hard for children to fall. However, must act with care that no one pushes the screens too hard or stick anything sharp through there to decrease the integrity of the screen. The Manager on Duty, Ali Khalaf, was able to resolve a room request issue with professionalism and customer sensitivity. Lastly, as owners, we were invited to an update breakfast which included a buffet at the Columbia. The food there has taken a nose dive from 4 years ago. So including dinner and all of the sales pitches (updates), it still took us 3.5 hours to finish. It did save us a little over $300 in ticket sales and gift cards so you have to weigh it out for yourselves.",Date of stay: June 2018,Vacation Village at Parkway,4,"Kissimmee, Florida"
Explosive!,"The water park is thrilling, aesthetically pleasing and handicap friendly. The park was very clean; from the bathrooms to the restaurants. Go early but stay late to see the volcano come to life after dark. It is definitely a full day excursion but for our family, we could have spent 2 entire days there.
For those traveling with people with disabilities, the entire park is wheelchair accessible, many lifeguards at EVERY ride to aid patrons and assistance given for those who need special attention.
We will definitely go again!!",Date of experience: June 2018,Universal's Volcano Bay,4,"Orlando, Florida"
