Excelent fishing and sailing experience,"First I just wanted to try the fishing experience in Skiatos.I chose Dimitris's fishing boat and it was the best choice I have ever made! I went fishing for about 4 hours and we had everything at our disposal: a complete fishing equipement, sandwiches, beer, water, fruits,etc.He was a real captain, we just enjoied fishing. Although it was a short fishing trip,everyone caught fish!
I liked it so much that next day I invited my brother with his family on Dimitris's boat: his wife and his 2,5 year old daughter. We enjoied beautiful landscaped, we went swiming near a gorgeous cave and we stoped at Lalaria beach! Everything was awsome! I trully recommend Dimitris for Skiathos Fishing Trips!!!",Date of experience: June 2017,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,5,"Skiathos, Greece"
