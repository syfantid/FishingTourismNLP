Zante fishing,Wow what can i say about this trip.just an amazing experience fishing the old traditional way.you leave zante harbour 7.30 am traveling out in the boat for a round 90 min then the anchor goes in and you then start putting the nets in this takes around 90 min .you then go too a lovely quiet beach for around 2 hr too snorkel or just have a few beers in the bar there.them you head back too the nets and bring them in which takes about 1hr .watching the nets coming in with fish we even had a octopus. Then it's food time all made with the fresh catch of the day.a few beers and wine too wash it down.then head back too zante harbour arriving around 4.00 pm .was a fantastic experience,Date of experience: September 2018,Zante Fishing Tours,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
