Day long fishing/touring trip,"Words cannot describe the wonderful time we had on this boat. We started at 10 am and went around several breathtaking locations stopping for swimming and fishing. The captain and his crew went out of their way to please us. They cooked for us the catch of the day, a variety of fish, right there on the boat. It was the freshest and tastiest fish ever. My son Telly and daughter-in-law Paola, from Monterey, California, my wife Martha and I, from the Los Ageles area, had a fantastic time all day long. Never a dull moment. I love to fish and the captain would stop at different locations he has marked on his GPS and let me fish. The other three would jump off the boat and go swimming. Needless to say it was the best trip to Milos we ever had. We returned at 7 pm. They even had a surprise bithday cake for my wife. We certainly formed a good frienship that we plan on keeping by returning next year. Highly recommend to anyone wishing a great time touring around the island of Milos in Greece.",Date of experience: July 2018,Milos Fishing Trip,5,"Milos, Greece"
