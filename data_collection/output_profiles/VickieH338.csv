Highlight of the holiday!,"What other way to celebrate your 49th birthday than a visit to this beautiful place! I was pretty excited when I opened my birthday card to discover we were going to visit an apiary and it didn’t disappoint, from the minute we drove down the bumpy county lane in beautiful countryside to being warmly welcomed by the lovely Eleni & Thanassis I knew it was going to be good!
Lovely homemade lemonade, water and coffee when we arrived, an introduction to the friendly cats then suited up in full bee keeper suits to begin the tour. My sons age 10 &14 were kept thoroughly engaged throughout by Thanassis & Eleni as were the other family that joined the tour, there were a total of 7 of us and we were all allowed to hold a frame of bees, we watched a baby bee and then held it on our hands, the amount we all learnt about these incredible creatures was amazing. We then went inside (a relief to shed the suits in that heat) to see how the honey was extracted and bottled and then went for a tasting session of the 3 different honeys produced, pollen and other bee products!
More refreshments including wine, cake and cheese pies...could this birthday get any better!!! We all made our own beeswax candle to take home and there were a few products you could purchase, having brought 1 large jar of honey for ourselves I’m now at home in the UK kicking myself for not filling my suitcase with it! Best honey I’ve tasted!
If you’re wondering about doing this tour, do it! Great value and so interesting.
Thank you Thanassis & Eleni and keep up the good work!",Date of experience: August 2019,Dias Beekeeping,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic day out!,"This is a boat trip with a difference, a working fishing boat and you watch them haul the nets in...all 2.5km of them! Antonia was the perfect host, answering all our questions, providing us with homemade cake and coffee on arrival, tasty bruschetta later on, then cooking the catch of the day. So accommodating for us fussy non sea food eaters too with a delicious chicken and sausage casserole! Stopped in a beautiful spot for swimming and snorkelling and endless jumping off the side of the boat and watching them unraveling their catch from the nets was fascinating, we saw loads of different fish, lobsters, spider crabs and star fish! This really is a great day out for all ages! Thank you Antonia, Michalis and crew! Xx",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Beautiful day out!,"Well worth a visit, the gardens are stunning and beautiful walks around the grounds with seasonal activities for kids. Lovely cafe serving great cakes and snacks but if you want a real treat book in for afternoon tea, the best I’ve had in Somerset in a stunning room overlooking the formal gardens.",Date of experience: June 2019,Hestercombe Gardens,4,"Taunton, United Kingdom"
"Great park, something for all ages.","Love Vivary park there’s so much to do here, lovely walks, great play park areas, high ropes, golf & decent cup of coffee in the cafe!",Date of experience: July 2019,Vivary Park,4,"Taunton, United Kingdom"
Great for a relaxing break!,"Booked an overnight stay for some much needed r&r for my husband's birthday recently, we had a wonderful time. The staff were fantastic, friendly, helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Food was great, breakfast could have had a cheeky sausage and a couple of rashers of bacon thrown in to give it top marks but everything was cooked to perfection and lots of healthy choices. We booked via a third party and got an amazing price for our overnight stay and all food thrown in so we were expecting a basic room which is what we got but it was spotlessly clean and bed was really comfortable, shower looked very dated but had great water pressure. Some areas of the building are being worked on which is great to see they are spending money updating the facilities. The pool, sauna, steam room were great and discovered a ladies only steam room with twinkly lights in the ceiling in the ladies fitting rooms which was pure bliss! Both of us had massages, mine was an aromatherapy all over body massage which was heavenly, my husband had a sports massage which he said was great. Overall would definately recommend Cedar falls, beautiful setting, staff were just so welcoming and the place had a lovely relaxed air about it, we came home feeling like we'd been away for a week!",Date of stay: December 2012,Cedar Falls Health Farm & Spa,4,"Taunton, United Kingdom"
