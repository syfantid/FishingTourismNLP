Great family run hotel with lovely food,"Great family run hotel with really good food, we had the Zimbambwean Boboti which was the best I have had (in and out of Africa!)

Like all hotels in Moffat it is on the high street so does not have a private car park but it is a very safe area.",Date of stay: October 2020,Buccleuch Arms Hotel,4,"Moffat, United Kingdom"
A fantastic place,"We had a great stay, my wife and I and our teenage girls. The villa and pool and grounds are finished to the very highest standards.
Vaso and her family were lovely and couldn't have been more helpful.

We had a great meal with amazing views at Lofos Soilis (5 min walk) and the one Vaso recommend Tu something....about a 15 min walk.

The Turtle island boat trip was another highlight.",Date of stay: July 2019,Vatia 2-Bedroom Private Pool Villa with sea view,4,"Zakynthos, Greece"
One night stay,We had a great stay here recently. The staff are great and the food is first class. It is set back from the main road so quiet.,Date of visit: October 2018,Sportsmans Restaurant,4,"Carlisle, United Kingdom"
Excellent stay,"A party of 10 of us stayed last Saturday night, we had a first class meal with lots of local produce including game and venison served with very good wines, a very comfortable night and a superb breakfast. Richard and his team were excellent hosts. It was nice to escape wi-fi too!
We will return next year.",Date of stay: September 2018,March Bank Hotel,4,"Canonbie, United Kingdom"
A lovely day on the water,"My wife and I had a great day with Efth and Dimitrios. It was idyllic on their very chilled boat and lovely and cool (er) on the sea.

We caught dozens of species of fish which Efth talked to us about with her excellent English. She then cooked up a feast on the boat, one of the best meals we have ever had with their own fish and...vegetables, olive oil, wine etc, amazing!

They have two sets of snorkel and masks we used. All you need to take is a swimming costume and a towel, there is a loo on board and a cabin below to change in.

One of the highlights of our holiday!",Date of experience: July 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
The most amazing location,"Nyathi is now our favourite place in the world!
Initially we thought missing the dawn and dusk game drives (due to the gates being closed 6pm to 6am) was a drawback - however there is no need to leave the rest camp as you can see the most amazing wildlife from your balcony/bed/bath/plunge pool. We saw 4 of the big 5 as well as kudu, bushbuck & warthog. The shop is only 10 minutes away via the road (15 mins across the park) and is very well stocked plus the BBQ and kitchen are first class. The exterior and interior are so well designed, the feel traditional but 5 star. A truly amazing place, we all enjoyed it so much, there was wildlife to see all day long.
We did do a game drive via the main rest camp and it's advisable to call up and book these drives in advance as they get booked up - especially at weekends.",Date of stay: October 2017,Nyathi Rest Camp,4,"Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa"
Great hotel,"Although the most expensive in PE we found this hotel had great rooms, views and facilities. The bars and restaurant were very good, in the evening they had a curry buffet which was excellent.
We stayed for one night en route to the Addo NP.",Date of stay: October 2017,The Boardwalk Hotel,4,"Summerstrand, South Africa"
Not great,"Not a great experience. We arrived only for Reception to ask for payment when we had already paid in advance via hotels.com. We had been assured in advance that our rooms were next to each other as we had our daughter with us, however they had no record of this...they did manage to move us and to get us near, about 4 doors away but our daughter had to go in a disabled room.
The air conditioning did not work in our room.
The wifi was not working properly.
The pool is tiny, about 12 foot by 12 foot and overlooked by the hotel's noisy cooling tower and overlooks a building site.
The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel is probably OK for a business stay but not for a family holiday I'm afraid.",Date of stay: November 2017,Protea Hotel Port Elizabeth Marine,4,"Summerstrand, South Africa"
Stunning house and location,"We stayed 4 nights in the main, two bedroom apartment in the middle. The rooms and kitchen were lovely, finished to a very high standard. The double bed was king size. A cleaner and pool guy/host were in everyday and very, very helpful. From the pool it's literally 10 yards across the grass and you are on the beach.

From the pool we saw humpack whales coming out of the sea vertically which was amazing.

We mainly chilled by the pool, the sea was warm but generally has big waves as is not in the bay. We had a nice trip to Knysna Keys for lunch and a day trip to Plett for a whale/dolphin watching trip. Supper at Bongos in Milkwood village was good and the Spar there is very well stocked. The Friday night market was very small.
If the weather was cloudy below the hills we found that further along the coast (where it was flatter) it was sunny.

The creeks and forests all around this part of the Garden Route are really beautiful.
A great place in a lovely spot.",Date of stay: November 2017,Peacehaven On Sea,4,"Wilderness, South Africa"
We all had a really great meal,"Although we live locally we didn't know this pub existed until today. We went as a family and I was initially impressed with their range of real ales and unusual beers. We had great service and a really tasty, well cooked meal with very generous portions. Everything was handmade/home cooked including the tartare sauce, chutneys and muffins. The food and drinks came in good time. The new menu comes out in March and we'll be back to sample it.",Date of visit: February 2017,The Running Pump,4,"Preston, United Kingdom"
A truly fantastic place,"My wife, teenage girls and I stayed at Baluleni for 4 nights and had the most fantastic time, it was beyond our expectations, a very special place. We have never been so sad to leave anywhere! The owners Elke and Evert couldn't have been more hospitable, nothing was too much effort. It is a truly wild, remote place yet still very comfortable and luxurious. Just driving down the track to the lodge we saw countless antelope and a herd of 6 elephants in the road! There was even giraffe outside the girls glamping tent as we approached it.
The rangers/guides were brilliant and so knowledgeable, they made it really fun and interesting (even to two teenage girls!) We did evening and morning game drives in Balule (around the lodge) which has the most amazing density of wildlife and we saw lots including elephant and lion there, both under 20 metres from the safari car. We spent the day in and around the lovely swimming pool watching a family of warthogs.
We'd also highly recommend the trip we did with the lodge ranger Matthew to the public part of the Kruger, we had a brilliant day and saw the Big Five as well as lots of other rare species. Also recommended is the Panoramic tour we did with guide Jan. Even with some low cloud the views were stunning.
The food was simply fantastic, 3 course Cordon Bleu dinners etc and lovely to sit outside around the fire in the boma with a sundowner. The talented chef and all of the camp staff were very nice and helpful.
We hired an SUV and, as they had had some very heavy showers it was useful getting up some of the steep slopes on the drive yet some guests managed fine in normal x2 wheel drive cars.
Simply an amazing place. Nick & Elizabeth",Date of stay: December 2016,Baluleni Safari Lodge,4,"Balule Nature Reserve, South Africa"
Seaview B&B Isle of Mull,"Seaview is excellent, we had a 2 night stay in August and found it unfaultable. The breakfasts are unrivalled globally!
There are really very few B&Bs on Mull and Seaview is uniquely placed by two of the best eateries on the Island. The Keel Row is next door (we left our kids - 11 & 14 in the B&B with a film whilst we had a nice supper alone and a 10 min walk away in an excellent seafood restaurant.
There is a small beach 200 yards away and we had a puppy in tow and she too was made to feel very welcome.
Fionnophort by far has the best weather on the Island as is surrounded by coast on the three sides.",Date of stay: August 2013,Seaview Bed & Breakfast,4,"Isle of Mull, United Kingdom"
