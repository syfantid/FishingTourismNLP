It gets better each visit!,"It was our third visit to skosh and we took our friend for her birthday. Her first observation was when you are in the restaurant you feel like you could be anywhere in the world. Then the food happened, and that took her to another place, the food tantalising her taste buds, as well as the visual delights. It truly is an experience you should not miss out on.",Date of visit: September 2019,skosh,1,"York, United Kingdom"
Home from home,"My mum wanted to take us to villa kiydan for a holiday, I really didn’t want to go....but so glad we did, it was such a lovely place, and onur and family are really quite the hosts, looked after our every need, from hiring electric scooters, which he has now purchased himself to let his guests use, and push bikes to pop out on, water coolers in apartment, not to mention the fab pool, which was a delight to swim in every morning at eight o’clock.we feel like we made new friends on this trip.",Date of stay: September 2019,Dalyan Villa Kiydan Apartments,1,"Dalyan, Turkey"

H10 Dream !!!!,"We have just returned from a weeks holiday at this hotel, and we would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a relaxing and quiet holiday. The breakfast is probably the best we have ever eaten, and the waiting staff were amazing, we did have lunch there a couple of times, but we did not particularly enjoy what was on offer.maybe just personal choice,and we did use the spa facilities once, sauna etc, my husband was full of cold and thought the steam room would help, but unfortunately it was out of order, but knowbody bothered to tell us. We did tell them at reception, and the lady wrote our room number down to see what could be done, but nothing happened and we were still charged.But on the whole we would go to H10 hotel again somewhere else.",Date of stay: January 2019,H10 Ocean Dreams,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"

Dog friendly NOT!!!!,"We visited here on Wednesday, travelling from Lulworth, as it say on trip advisor that it’s great food and dog friendly, which it also says on the door, but alas it wasn’t dog friendly, only in take away area, so what’s the point of that!! We have a small well behaved dog, and there was actually know body in, the waitress said I could speak to the manager, but he was constantly on his phone, so yes we apparently have missed out on great fish and chips, but we were also mislead about the service they offer.",Date of visit: April 2018,Fish 'n' Fritz,1,"Weymouth, United Kingdom"

Birthday weekend,"We just stayed at white horse, and on the whole it was good, our room no5 had amazing views, but the floor was horrendous,the person who slept on right side, if they got out during night for a loo visit , the pipes under floor started clanging, and anytime anyone flushed aloo or used water, the sound reverberated around our room.the food was good a the team were friendly, but the bottle of Sauvignon I ordered was terrible, and I was looking forward to there "" fine wines""!!!!!!
