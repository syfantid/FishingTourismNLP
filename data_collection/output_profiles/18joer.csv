Best suits in the world,"I visited Chiang Mai and got two suits made here. The suits fit amazingly and the quality is unbelievable. They level of professionalism was pretty outstanding, they had me and my friends measured 3 separate times in the matter of a day while we traveled Chiang Mai as we had a very limited time frame.

I was so satisfied with the suits that I got two more delivered earlier this year. Cannot reccomend New Moda strongly enough.",Date of experience: April 2019,New Moda Custom Tailors,5,"Chiang Mai, Thailand"
We Caught TOO MANY FISH!,"My girlfriend and I went on a fishing tour and we caught over 10 fish in 3 hours! We caught so many fish that we shared some of our catch with another fishing tour so that they could eat lunch.

The fish were delicious, and the captain and his daughter were excellent hosts and guides! We had such a blast, would strongly recommend this to anyone interested in a beautiful trip around Milos, especially if you're looking to catch a lot of fish!",Date of experience: September 2019,Milos Fishing Trip,5,"Milos, Greece"
