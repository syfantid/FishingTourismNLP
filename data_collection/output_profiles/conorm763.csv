"Fantastic trip with passionate, sustainable local family run business.","I had a great day today, Anthi was warm from the first email to the goodbye hug.

Anthi is passionate about fishing, the marine environment and conserving it and knows the local area like the back of her hand. She and her crew are great accompaniments with a huge diversity of experiences and range of knowledge sets, you'll certainly learn alot!

We met up with her and the crew just after lunch and ventured out passing by a few spots where they showed us some traditional fishing spots and techniques, talking us through the local species and how they have changed over the years, (ask plenty of questions they're knowledgeable and you will get much more from it).

Eventually after an hour we reached the local bays where we spent the rest of the trip fishing, eating and snorkelling and chatting with the rest of our party and crew, (we did not know one another but at the end we felt we were leaving friends).

Brill trip, stop reading about it and just book it already.",Date of experience: October 2018,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
Great value accomodation,I stayed for one night on a business trip in Enniskillen and was treated very well by effective and friendly staff. I've paid a lot more for accommodation that is nowhere near the same standard. I'll be staying again..,Date of stay: November 2014,Belmore Court & Motel,5,"Enniskillen, United Kingdom"
