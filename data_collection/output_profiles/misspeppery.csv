Wonderful fishing trip!,"We were so lucky to be able to book a tour last minute! We had such a wonderful time learning about the different methods of fishing used. Assisting Mohammed remove the fish caught in the net was a great highlight. He and Anthi explained the different species very well.

They prepared the days catch in several different ways, all of which tasted amazing. Of all of our meals we had during our stay, this was by far my favorite.

This is a very enlightening tour. Anthi and Mohammed are wonderful hosts, and we could not have asked for a more pleasant experience.",Date of experience: August 2020,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
