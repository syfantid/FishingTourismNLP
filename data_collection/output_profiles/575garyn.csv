Great food,"Me and my girlfriend booked a table after reading the reviews , and must say we’re not disappointed , the refurb is top quality and the food was probably the best I’ve had in a pub . Great attentive staff , will recommend and return",Date of visit: November 2019,The Cross House,1,"Doynton, United Kingdom"
Good as reviews say,"What can I say good food in a great setting . I had the Greek tasting plate which was loads , easily feed two , starters were large so bear in mind . Good first meal in Rhodes",Date of visit: September 2019,To Megiston,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
The cakes were nice,"We stayed here for 7 days , we didn’t pay much for it so we weren’t expecting luxury , we did have a great hol but here’s my honest no frills verdict . Very clean cleaners great , yannis on reception was really helpful when we changed rooms due to our air con not working and our room being directly under the bottle bank which gets emptied by a lorry around 4.00 am in the morn , avoid room 259 or those around it .
Food was ok , always something to eat but quite a lot of waiting for cutlery etc , plus food gets cold quick , plus it’s very bright and loud , it was just a case of eat and leave , we ate out more come end of hol . beer not great and cocktails are just cheap low volume spirits with grenadine or curraco served in plastic glasses , wasn’t sure wether to drink them or pour them down the throat of a giant clown “it’s a knock out “ styley . Good position to beach , about 2 mins walk , main town 20 mins, though we cut through town rather than take the coast road , plus you avoid immigration alley as we called it , bit sketchy in my opinion , great food in town though beware the first bar where you get your beer in boot glasses , rip off 11euros ! Good car hire from girl in hotel , we could of got it about 15 euros cheaper for the 3 days but she was not bothered about little knocks on the car if they happened so very easy going , all in all I wouldn’t go back here but would to Rhodes , old town is lush",Date of stay: September 2019,Island Resorts Marisol Hotel,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Over priced,"We called in for a spot of lunch and ordered chicken and bacon salad and the stir fried fillet salad , the beef salad consisted of 2 tom quarters and some cucumber hap hazardously chopped , with a few lumps of steak , and a garnish of tired watercress , 13 quid ! , The chicken and bacon was greasier than an Italian chip shop owners fiat engine . Would of complained but no one came to ask if food was ok and fire alarm went off as I was paying , say fire alarm it could of been the “ you’ve had your pants pulled down alarm for all I know , won’t go back",Date of visit: May 2019,The Golden Heart,1,"Winterbourne, United Kingdom"
"Fish, swim , eat , drink laugh","I have been looking forward to this trip since June and it lived up to everything and more , Antonio was so good on communication no matter when , being a keen fisherman it was fascinating to see all the different species bought in , we all got stuck in getting the fish out as soon as possible ready for michalis to cook , anchored in a pretty cove and basically chilled until lunch was made , lobster , fish , pasta salads etc all washed down with homemade wine .. antonio was so welcoming and in no time the 10 on board were chatting like old friends .. fantastic day will return 100% next time in kefalonia , thank you again . Gary and Amanda",Date of experience: September 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Fish,Eat ,drink ,laugh swim .. great day","I have been looking forward to this trip after reading all the great reviews and it lived up to it and more , from the great , quick communication from Antonio ,to the actual day itself was fantastic . As a keen fisherman myself it was great to see the nets pulled in and to get stuck in retrieving the fish as quick as possible , so many species we lost count plus a slipper lobster .. all cooked on board with salads pasta and plenty of wine , Antonio made us all feel welcome and we were all laughing and chatting to the others on board in no time . Just the best day . Thank you and we will be back next time in kefalonia",Date of experience: September 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Save up,"Four of us stayed here for a gig , the reviews are bang on but we had no choice as elsewhere was full , so we knew what to expect ,the lady on reception / bar was nice .... oh and the orange juice .. the end .",Date of stay: June 2018,Tudor Court Hotel,1,"Swansea, United Kingdom"
aga baked my bumhole,"we didnt look at the reviews as was spur of the moment decision to eat here , we looked at the board and it said ""aga baked pastys salad garnish and branston"", what we got was a microwaved cheap pasty plonked on a plate with a teaspoon of pickle , thats it , not even half a tomato ! two instant coffees and 14 quid lighter , we could almost see the funny side of it to be honest it was that crap , a party of 3 women also called in , one asked to use the loo and was told to use the public ones 5 mins walk away , the bald headed owner obviously has had a personality removal , i almost wanted to go back order a few pastys and bugger off just to annoy the bloke .",Date of visit: October 2017,The Captain's House Afternoon Tea,1,"Lynmouth, United Kingdom"
good food good wine,"lovely meal , good service , good wine . very reasonable. definitely recommend, had baked Camembert, and 3 different tapas dishes , pigs cheeks were amazingly tender",Date of visit: October 2017,The Oak Room,1,"Lynton, United Kingdom"
Bit of a squeeze,"7 of us stayed here last weekend while doing the McMillan mighty hike . We were given room 4 , lovely and clean but to be honest a double bed is too big for the room , a single at most , we had to walk crab like around bottom of bed and no room for bed side cabinets to put a cuppa on or anything else . All the bits and bobs were there but they all seemed on top of each other due to size of room . The shower was sporadic to say the least , the room was unbearably hot and very noisy from the street behind , our friends had sea views in rooms 2/3 and they were kept awake from kids partying on beach opposite , the breakfast selection was fantastic and the owners gave us pastries ,fruit etc on our early start on the Saturday , this is not a moan about the owners , they were more than helpful , and I know they can't help people making noise outside the property but it did annoy , so just letting you know .. it's not as quiet or spacious as it may seem on website .",Date of stay: July 2017,Seaspray Guest House,1,"Weymouth, United Kingdom"
Lovely walk,"What can you say , parked in the banks arms and walked the circular walk of harry , then onto south beach up to middle beach and back 9 miles , lovely weather and a lovely pint of 7.9 % bootlegger moonshine back at pub , cracking day",Date of experience: April 2017,Old Harry Rocks,1,"Swanage, United Kingdom"
Great b&b,"Booked really late and arrived well before we were meant to , but sue showed us straight to our room , lovely large room with everything of a really high quality , more of a posh hotel really ! , a few places to eat were recommended and a few beers later and an earlier 9 mile walk the bed was more than comfortable , great breakfast in morning , fresh fruit and full English . Defiantly will return . Highly recommended",Date of stay: April 2017,Ocean Lodge,1,"Swanage, United Kingdom"
"Nice , bit pricey","Good food but bit over priced , and packed in tight , I'm all for some Italian atmosphere but when you can easily hear the next tables chatter , loose a table maybe !",Date of visit: April 2017,La Trattoria,1,"Swanage, United Kingdom"
birthday weekend,"16 of us stayed here for 3 nights last week and had a great time , everyone we met were more than friendly, we were given a ""funkie"" room as it was my 50th at no extra cost which was unexpected , the other people in our party were more than happy with there rooms which were situated on the basement floor , the rooms are red hot , even with radiators off , but it is iceland so it was nice to come back to , the only thing, although this isnt a moan as i read this on other reviews is that the icelandic do like to party hard and our room although bigger than the others was also alot noisier right up until around 5.00am ! and i do mean noisy !its silly expensive here so be warned , i would defiantly recommend using the Reykjavik happy hour app , it worked a treat and saved us a bloody fortune , the TIVOLI bar was a nice chilled place and in happy hour was around 7/8 quid for a beer and a wine so not the end of the world , fill your suitcases with food if your on a budget though as supermarkets are dear , be warned , we used VIATOR for all our tours and they were fantastic , on time and very helpful , we also used ICELANDIC TAXI TOURS for airport transfers and again there were on time and very helpful , defiantly a weekend to remember",Date of stay: April 2016,Apartment K,1,"Reykjavik, Iceland"
rubbish service,"we booked this as we mistakenly read the forge where we usually park was fully booked, we arrived at 5.00am to a locked cabin , rang the number given us and was told im at the airport ill be 5 mins , fair enough we thought , 20 plus mins later no sign , he eventually showed up about half hour after we called , with an empty van so obviously bull about him picking up from airport, then as more people had arrived he had to book everyone in , it took so long and the van was full people were actually walking to the airport rather than wait , we eventually got there an hour after arriving , and not so much as a apology . on our return we again waited for around 20 mins after they said they were on way , when we rang again the bloke said it was because of traffic ! its one right turn out the car park , not time to encounter too much traffic i would have thought , again no apology , all in all a shower of crap and wont use them again and would advise others to do the same",Date of visit: April 2016,Airport Tavern Public House,1,"Lulsgate Bottom, United Kingdom"
busy but well ran,"we have just returned from a fortnight in a maxi tent with canvas hols , there were 14 in total in our party ages feom 7 /16.. this was my first time camping abroad and all in all was a great hol , to be fair out tent was kinda on the small side for 6 as one kid had to sleep in the living area so 5 would in my view be the max . also theres no where to put any clothes , a few drawers of some description would be handy ., we didnt see the rep from day one which wasnt a prob as if needed im sure we could have made contact, and the others in our party spoke to her a few times and said she was very helpful . the supermarket is a bit on the pricey side so again if your there for a fortnight def would pay to maybe hire a car or bikes to get shopping from local supermarket . the park was really busy and first time ive had to do the sunbed run which pissed me off a bit , but when in rome do as the germans/dutch do i suppose ! local beach is nice if maybe a bit boring , barriti is a more interesting beach especially if you like snorkeling etc , both restaurants on site are good the one at the top end being slightly better with a better choice , theres a good one out the main drag in about 200 yards on the left , real farmhouse with wooded grill , bit pricey , but very helpful , beers 4.50 on site and thats about the average all round , wines, good house about 10 , pizzas about 6 for a margherita , def using the free bus but def dont be shy about pushing in as no one else seems to be , and catch from where drops u off , or you wont get on the last one or two back ,. wifi is crap , dont bother waste of 5e , unless your gonna stay thums glued to it all times , local buses sporadic but cheap. loads of lizards , and pools chaos , human soup ,think thats it , if you want a quit site dont go here in peak , simple but if you want a busy site with a good holiday vibe and dont mind the occasional que ,, happy days .",Date of stay: August 2013,Park Albatros Village,1,"San Vincenzo, Italy"
