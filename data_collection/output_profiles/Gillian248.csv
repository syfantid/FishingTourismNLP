Covid safe and excellent food and service,"Coronavirus safety measures

As soon as you enter the Abbey Arms it is very clear that the pub/restaurant owners have considered the impact of coronavirus and we were very impressed with the measures that have been taken. Customers are asked to use the automatic sanitiser on arrival and there are signs all around the pub advising staff and customers how to stay safe, such as reminders to wash hands and to keep your distance. On arrival, you will be taken to a table and introduced to your server. Every other table has a ‘reserved’ sign on to ensure plenty of space between tables. Staff wear full visors and both food and drinks are served at the table rather than the bar.

Food

The Abbey Arms has signed up to the governments Eat Out to Help Out scheme so you get delicious food for half the price. We were a party of four, three had fillet steak and I had the lamb. It was honestly one of the nicest meals we have ever had, the food was of excellent quality and locally sourced.

Drinks

Drinks are served at your table and as it was a Wednesday we took advantage of their wine offer - If you buy 2 glasses of wine you get the rest of the bottle free. I can highly recommend their New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.

Summary

The Vale Royal Abbey Arms is a traditional country pub/ restaurant in a beautiful 200-year-old listed building, close to Delamere Forest. You will be given a warm welcome, it offers excellent value for money, food is fresh, seasonal and locally sourced. Their home-made food is made from quality ingredients and is honestly the best. They offer daily specials and have various special offers on both food and drink.

Excellent Sunday lunch,"Great atmosphere, delicious food, welcoming, warm and friendly staff. Don’t hesitate to book. You won’t be disappointed",Date of visit: March 2020,"The White Bull, Ribchester",1,"Ribchester, United Kingdom"
Great place but gets packed out,I loved it here. Bought food from angor sol (can’t spell it!) which is Cambodian cuisine and it was excellent. It was £9 for a delicious curry with rice. My friend had the Tiffin platter from Chaat which she said was delicious. We bought a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc for £17.50 which I thought was reasonable. Finished the night next door in the Bakers Vaults which was great. Both places have a brilliant atmosphere. A great Saturday night out,Date of visit: February 2020,The Produce Hall,1,"Stockport, United Kingdom"
Beautiful....but some unexpected additional charges,"This hotel will not disappoint. Recently fully refurbished and positioned right on the beach, you really do feel like you have died and gone to heaven.

Staff were friendly and courteous and keen to meet the guests expectations of a 5 star hotel. Our room was beautiful, spotlessly clean and the view was amazing. The breakfast buffet was excellent.

Our only gripe was the unexpected ‘extra’ charges; $20 per day to park your car and the best part of $30 per day if you wanted an umbrella on the beach, even though the sun beds on the beach are free. We stayed here a couple of years ago and as Hilton Diamond status members we didn’t pay for either of these things, so for a 10 night stay it added up to a lot of money.

That said, as long as you are aware of these extra charges and factor them into your budget, you will not be disappointed and we will definitely return again in the future.",Date of stay: November 2019,Hilton Marco Island Beach Resort,1,"Marco Island, Florida"
Great afternoon out,"There were only the 2 of us and Captain Marco. What an interesting fun afternoon, Captain Marco kindly tethered my kayak to his paddle board as I was nervous. Highly recommend this trip and tour guide",Date of experience: November 2019,Marco Island Kayak Adventures,1,"Marco Island, Florida"
Delicious,"Went twice in a row. As good as Haagen Dazs and very generous portion sizes. Too generous in fact. I had a small, topped with hot caramel sauce. It was so delicious I ate the lot then felt sick for the rest of the day. Lol serves me right for being greedy.",Date of visit: October 2019,Sweet Annie's,1,"Marco Island, Florida"
Great for a cheap meal,I had the steak wrap which was nice enough but they were out of guacamole which was supposed to be the base..... had mayo instead,Date of visit: October 2019,Subway,1,"Marco Island, Florida"
Best pizza in town,We shared a large 5 meat thin crust pizza and a salad and they were both excellent. They were a bit mean with the wine though. A glass means about an inch and a half,Date of visit: October 2019,Joey's Pizza & Pasta House,1,"Marco Island, Florida"
"Excellent food, large portions!",I highly recommend the crispy taco shell salad that comes with rice and black beans. I had the ground beef option and it was delicious. Large enough to serve 2 people,Date of visit: October 2019,Nacho Mama's,1,"Marco Island, Florida"
Well maintained and soooo beautiful,"Soft white sand edged with thousands of shells at the shoreline. Dolphins, pelicans and many other birds will keep you entertained",Date of experience: October 2019,South Marco Beach,1,"Marco Island, Florida"
Duquesa’s best kept secret,"When luxury exceeds expectations, you really don’t know where to start......

The brand new Three Palms in Duquesa on the Costa Del Sol has all the luxury, comforts and elegance of the world’s finest 5 star small hotels of the world. We were the only guests this week and Julie and Steve let us view all 5 suites. I can confirm that each suite has been individually designed and beautifully furnished, the ultimate in luxury and comfort. Rooms are air-conditioned and double-glazed, each with a furnished balcony or terrace, bath and shower, slimline TV with every channel known to man, docking ports, complimentary WiFi, complimentary tea and coffee making facilities and your own mini fridge. The communal areas are equally as elegant and luxurious, as is the pool and bar area, the sea views add that extra special touch.

Julie and Steve are the perfect hosts, making you feel important to them as soon as you walk through the door. Breakfast is made to order, at your preferred time, and there is plenty to choose from.

The property is just a few minutes walk to the beautiful marina in Duquesa which has many different restaurants and other amenities. If you like to walk along the sea front there is a long promenade where you can walk for miles. It is also well located to explore what the Costa Del Sol area has to offer and is only a short drive (approx 20-30 mins) to the busier towns of Estepona, Marbella, Sotogrande, Puerto Banus and Gibraltar.

This place is ideal for couples, friends, and family gatherings and I have no doubts that when word gets out it will be booked up for the year.

Thanks Julie and Steve for a wonderful stay. We are very much looking forward to staying with you again soon.

Readers, any questions? Don’t hesitate to ask",Date of stay: September 2019,Three Palms Boutique B&B (PALM TREE ROOM),1,"Puerto de la Duquesa, Spain"
Reality of fishing,"A very educational trip. Ate fish I’d never even heard of (pork fish) and felt sorry for the stingrays and octopus that we caught as they also got sliced up and thrown into the pan. Lovely hosts, excellent food, more than enough for everyone. You will catch loads of fish that will be cooked for your lunch and your hosts will make you very welcome.",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best food in katelios,"Don’t book half board as the menu is limited. The full menu is excellent, service is excellent, everything is fresh and home made including the fries (which are the best ever) and it’s not expensive at all. Highly recommend you visit.",Date of visit: August 2019,Rosebud Bistro,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Good food, good prices","Excellent service, plenty of choice, lovely food, perfect setting right on the beach and 10% discount if you say you are with Thomas Cook holidays.",Date of visit: August 2019,Blue Sea,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
4th visit,"The Magnolia gets better every year. The family who run it are lovely and the staff that work for them are second to none. Everything is very well maintained and spotlessly clean.

Outside school holidays it tends to be a bit quiet for us (we’ve only done that once) but during school holidays you get a fantastic mix of adults who are stuck with school holidays (teachers, etc). There is therefore a great age range, from honeymooners to 60+ who are looking for a bit of child free time. The clientele are all warm and friendly and a laugh a minute. Thanks to Mike for putting on a fun quiz and thanks to Chris and Ana for teaching us Greek dancing. We met up with friends from previous years and also made some new ones and 10 of us have already booked to go again next August. If you want to join the fun bus you’d be made very welcome.",Date of stay: August 2019,Magnolia Resort,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Hard working, friendly staff","This hotel has many good features. The public areas are very well maintained, the room was modern and mostly as expected, food is very good, the evening entertainment was good and created a fun atmosphere, and staff are a credit to the Sentido group of hotels. They respond promptly to emails sent in advance of your trip and everyone is warm, friendly and hard working. My only gripe was the corridors and front doors to the rooms desperately need replacing. As you don’t sleep or eat in corridors I would definitely return as it was good value for money and all staff work hard and do an excellent job.",Date of stay: April 2019,Sentido Tucan,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Fabulous!,"We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. We paid by using our points and were kindly upgraded to a room on the 7th floor with a stunning view of the beach and ocean. Special thanks to Mauricio Rodriguez for arranging this, it made our trip so much more special and we have already booked another trip for April / May of next year. Our room was beautiful; 2 very comfortable queen beds, good bathroom, balcony, coffee maker and a fridge. The young lady who looked after our room did an amazing job too. Staff in the hotel were welcoming and friendly, including poolside staff. There are sun beds on the beach but these weren’t owned by the hotel so you had to pay for them. The price was $27 a day for 2 beds and a shade.

To give an overview, the hotel sits in a beautiful spot right on the beach. Across the road there are a few little shops and 3 restaurants. We ate at 2 of them and both were very good.

We were 5 minutes from Clearwater which is a lot busier but definitely worth a visit. We had a car but there is a little trolley bus that stops at the hotel. The bus runs from Clearwater right up to St Pete’s beach. We took a dolphin boat trip tour from Clearwater and thoroughly enjoyed it, learning not only about dolphins but also about the houses in the area owned by Tom Cruise which was an interesting bonus. Clearwater is where you will find the headquarters of the Church of Scientology which I suppose is why Tom has some of his properties there. We bought the trip off Groupon so got the tour for $15 each which was a real bargain.

This hotel certainly deserves our 5 stars",Date of stay: October 2018,Sheraton Sand Key Resort,1,"Clearwater, Florida"
Grim.,"This hotel should be sued for mis-selling. It was advertised as a boutique hotel and spa and if we weren’t meeting up with friends we would have checked out the minute we walked through the door. I feel sorry for the staff who work there as they must spend half their time dealing with complaints and people asking to change rooms. The photos on the website must be about 25 years old. It’s filthy, tatty, nothing is maintained and the furniture must surely have come from a 1970s house clearance. The photos are not what you will get. It needs maintenance outside and in. Correction, it’s beyond maintenance, the inside needs ripping out completely. And to top it off the quality of the breakfast was appalling. Never again",Date of stay: September 2018,The Lensfield,1,"Cambridge, United Kingdom"
Beautiful family run hotel,"This is our second visit to the Magnolia and we are already planning our third.

To begin with, the family who own and run the hotel are second to none for friendliness and quality and they work tirelessly to make sure their guests feel welcome and enjoy every moment of their holiday.

This year we booked bed and breakfast as we wanted to spend our evenings eating in the little tavernas that line the seafront. Whilst the food in the village restaurants has been OK, they have sadly not matched the food quality of the Rosebud Bistro at the Magnolia. The bistro has a menu that is different to the one that guests on half board choose from (this is quite limited) but if you choose from the main bistro menu you will not be disappointed. Everything is home made, and in my opinion, they serve the best lamb kleftiko on the island for €8.50. Bargain!

Please do not take any notice of any negative reviews about this hotel or the staff as I believe them to be very unfair. For example, I read a negative review about the housekeeping process that baffled me. I think the process of handing in a card to reception when you are ready for your room to be cleaned is an excellent idea, as we’ve all experienced that moment when the maid opens the door at the wrong time! Re the sun beds, the family have taken the feedback on board and have invested in luxurious cushions. There was also a review that said the reception was unmanned which simply isn’t true. If you have a question then please do not hesitate to message me and I will give you an honest answer.

To summarise, If you are looking for a beautiful adults only hotel, on the edge of a stunning greek village on the island of Kefalonia, then this is definitely the place for you. By the end of your holiday, you will feel that the family are your special friends and you will want to meet up with them again. Nota, Effy, Chris, Alex and all the other Magnolia staff are truly the best. So thank you for making our holiday perfect.",Date of stay: July 2018,Magnolia Resort,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fabulous weekend,"This hotel is second to none. It's right next door to the 02 arena and a 2 minute walk to the boat bus stop to all the major London sights. We were upgraded to a fabulous corner room overlooking the river, the room and bathroom were beautiful as were all the mod cons. Tea, coffee and toiletries were provided as were slippers and bathrobes. Whilst this is not a complaint, the lady who cleaned our room forgot to replace the face cloths which I like to use when freshening up but I'm sure that if I had phoned housekeeping they would have brought them to our room straight away. Apart from that, everything else was more than perfect. The bed was sooooo comfortable, sheets, duvet and pillows of the highest quality. The staff at this hotel are courteous, friendly and attentive. A credit to the Intercontinental group of hotels and to the owner. Thank you for a fantastic stay. We will definitely be back",Date of stay: October 2017,InterContinental London - The O2,1,"London, United Kingdom"
The family who own this hotel are second to none and work on hours to make sure their guests are well looked after,"We have just returned from an extended stay at this wonderful hotel. The family are truly the kindest hoteliers we have ever met who kindly gave us the use of their courtesy room to sleep in so that we didn't have to look for another hotel for our last night on the beautiful island of Kefalonia. We came away feeling like we had made friends for life and we can't wait to return again. We will also treasure the little gifts that they gave us as we left. The staff who work for them also work incredibly hard. Nothing is too much trouble, they stay focused on their work and are always aware of all their guests and attend to their every wish. The rooms are beautiful and are cleaned daily. Toiletries are in the room on arrival day which is a nice added touch of welcome. There is also a kettle and a fridge. Food quality is excellent. Breakfast is perfectly adequate so don't take any notice of any moans and groans. It's help yourself to the the most delicious bacon we have ever had, add boiled or scrambled eggs, beans, toast and finish with fruit, yogurt and Greek honey. Add fruit juice, choose from a selection of teas or coffees and if you're still hungry help yourself to more. Delicious! Lunch is served at the snack bar by the pool. Again, excellent quality, we chose and can recommend Nota's tuna salad, home made fries and home-made pizza, all costing about €5 each. We were on half board but chose to eat out some nights so the family allowed us to use our half-board vouchers for lunch which suited us better as the walk into the beautiful village to eat at the beach front tavernas was perfect for an evening out. Understandably, the family ask you not to take pool towels to the beach so we bought 2 huge beach towels from the village shop for €7 each. Bargain!
To Summarise, if you are looking for a beautiful adults only hotel in a peaceful setting but only ten minutes walk to the pretty little village of Katelios, then this is the place for you. So thank you Nota, Efi, Alex, Chris and all your amazing hardworking staff. We will definitely be returning",Date of stay: August 2017,Magnolia Resort,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Don't take any notice of negative reviews!,"This is our second visit to this hotel and I can't fault it. The rooms are beautiful, staff are warm and friendly, food is excellent and the view across the ocean is stunning. If I could live anywhere in the world, I would live at this hotel. What more is there to say?",Date of stay: July 2017,"Sheraton Fuerteventura Beach, Golf & Spa Resort",1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Will definitely return,"We stayed here for 7 nights from March 30th to April 6th booking through Hilton Honors. Our email request for a North facing gulf view room was responded to immediately and we were allocated room 620 which had a beautiful view. The room was large, great bathroom area, sofa, great TV with loads of channels. There is no executive lounge at this hotel but as we have Diamond status the hotel more than made up for it by giving us a free breakfast every morning and they also waived our resort fee so we were given 2 x $15 dollar vouchers to spend on food or drink, 2 free sun beds on the beach every day, 2 free bottles water in the room every day and free wifi. In terms of value, we travelled at the most expensive time of the year, but if you can visit off season, this hotel, it's location, and all it has to offer is definitely value for money. Personally I was a bit disappointed in the refurbishments that the Hotel is keen to make guests aware of. I preferred the old lobby area as the new one is a little 'soul less' . The other improvements are good, although I'm surprised that they haven't replaced the carpets in the corridors or bedrooms, or painted the walls beyond downstairs. Maybe this is still to be done? We were not disappointed in our room though. It was kept spotless by our lovely housekeeping lady, plenty of towels, toiletries, robes in the room and tea and coffee replenished daily. The pool area and sunset decks are new and cleaned daily, the beach is spotless and they have plenty of staff on the beach who will put your sun beds where you want them. There is also a little 'gulf cart' that drives up and down the Hilton area of the beach selling drinks and snacks, all chargeable to your room. Brilliant! They also have a little gift shop where staff are happy to wrap any gifts you buy.

Just one niggle - the hotel held an event on Wednesday and we weren't notified until late on Tuesday evening that regular guests wouldn't be able to use the pool or sunset decks from 1pm. All poolside sunbeds were removed by early morning so there was nowhere to sit making morning pool use poor. Their compensation for this was to give regular guests an additional 2 x $15 vouchers and an umbrella on the beach (umbrellas are charged for). I felt that all guests should have been notified of this well in advance of the event either by email or via the hotel's website. It didn't have a massive effect on us but we did feel for the family who had a disabled child as the young lady's wheelchair was not suitable for the beach and the pool and pool sun bed area was an important facility for them.

Overall, it was a fantastic trip, the hotel is beautifully positioned, right on the beach where you can watch dolphins swim in the sea and see Pelicans fishing for their food. It is definitely worth paying the extra for a gulf view room (choose the north side for the best views) as the garden view rooms will disappoint, particularly if you are on the south side of the hotel.

Special thanks to Robert Wentzlafff, assistant front office manager for responding promptly to my email request and for delivering the room I asked for.
Thanks also to our lovely housekeeping lady. I didn't catch her name but our room number was 620. And thanks also to Brian who works on the beach for carrying my sunbed to wherever I wanted it, and finally to the young man who drives the Gulf Buggy Cart up and down the beach all day catering to Hilton Hotel's guests. His Mai Tai cocktails are the best!",Date of stay: April 2017,Hilton Marco Island Beach Resort,1,"Marco Island, Florida"
"Quirky restaurant, Ok menu","Good environment, food reasonably priced for a Marco Ialand restaurant. Friendly staff, good service.",Date of visit: April 2017,Pinchers,1,"Marco Island, Florida"
Excellent. Went twice in a row!,"Fantastic food, great service, huge portions, 1 meal between 2 would have been enough. Highly recommend the chilli cheese dip starter (too much for 1 person so share). Also recommend the white fish served with yellow rice. Came with all the trimmings, couldn't eat it all!",Date of visit: April 2017,Nacho Mama's,1,"Marco Island, Florida"
Excellent location,"This restaurant is situated on the harbour front, overlooking one of the most beautiful waterways on Marco Island. Book in advance and ask for an outside table by the water. Food was good, reasonably priced, service very good but not perfect as we had to ask for someone to come and take our order. After that we were well looked after. The reason I have given it 4 stars and not 5 is because the booth we were allocated had extremely limited space. I am only 5'4"" and slim but I still felt squashed. My husband is 6'5"" and twice my size so he could barely move. I would recommend this restaurant for its location alone. Beautiful!",Date of visit: April 2017,CJ's on the Bay,1,"Marco Island, Florida"
Excellent service from the reservation team both at Qhotels and Mottram Hall in relation to a booking made for December,"I am writing this review in advance of a special stay booked for myself and my daughter in order to celebrate her 25th birthday and feel I should send a public thank you to the two lovely ladies who have been more than helpful and have gone way above the call of duty in order to meet my requirements. First of all, Claire in Qhotels central reservation team gave me lots of information and went out of her way to make sure everything in relation to the spa treatments, and dinner reservations were made according to our wishes. Today, having reflected on the choices made yesterday, I phoned the hotel directly and spoke to a lovely young lady by the name of Emma to discuss a possible room upgrade. I explained to Emma that the quality of the room is very important to me and she said rather than just relay the information that is on the system she would go and look at the rooms to see which ones were closest to what I was asking for. It's a shame that the beds in the patio rooms she described can't be split as they sounded like they were the ones I would have chosen but she had also phoned housekeeping and has allocated a room they recommended. I think Emma picked up on the fact that I am always nervous about rooms in hotels (we've all had bad experiences) so she offered to go and look and phoned me back within ten minutes to say that as there is currently a guest in the room she was thinking of she wasn't able to check it at this time but would definitely make sure she did this when she is working again and would phone me back. So ten out of ten for service so far. If this is the standard of service that Mottram Hall provides, I feel very confident that I have made the right choice for us. Roll on December 17th. Thank you girls.",Date of stay: November 2016,Mottram Hall,1,"Mottram St. Andrew, United Kingdom"
Absolutely beautiful hotel,"We moved to this hotel today from the Elba Sara and wish we'd done it early. I cannot fault a thing. It totally deserves its 5 star rating, staff are wonderful, the hotel is beautifully furnished, it is extremely well maintained, food is excellent and our room is not only beautifully furnished it is huge. So is the bathroom which has a separate bath, separate shower, a vanity area with 2 sinks and hairdryer and the loo is behind a screen. All very swish! We are in room 120 which is this hotels lowest category room as it is on the ground floor and overlooks the beautiful gardens but we have a large patio that is beautifully furnished and the unexpected bonus is we get plenty of sun on it and can also see the sea although not all garden rooms can. Although we do not have children with us there are lots here, there are plenty of facilities for them to enjoy and they are having a wonderful time. There are 4 pools and Immediately outside the back gate is a great beach with sun beds. An excellent hotel that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. Beware of other hotels in the resort. They can be just as expensive but are not a patch on this one.",Date of stay: November 2016,"Sheraton Fuerteventura Beach, Golf & Spa Resort",1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
Disappointing,"Reception staff very nice. First room offered was dreadful - dirty, shabby, everything very old and scruffy. Moved to a slightly better room but still not anywhere near the standard we expected. The room furnishings are old, bathroom tired (needs replacing) beds are old and rock hard, so are the pillows. The kettle doesn't work and neither does the air conditioning. Doesn't help that every time we step out of the room we are greeted by cockroaches that live in the corridor. Food OK. Would we stay here again? Definitely not.",Date of stay: October 2016,Elba Sara Beach & Golf Resort,1,"Fuerteventura, Spain"
2 night break,"This hotel has recently been bought by Steve Morgan (I think that's his name) who is a housing developer and who has made fantastic improvements to ensure all guests receive the best possible experience. Having stayed here before we were able to see the difference in quality and I would not hesitate to recommend it. We upgraded to a refurbished room for an extra £25 which was well worth it and if money is no object I suggest you spend an additional £25 per room for a view room as we were a little disappointed with our view but heyho you get what you pay for.
The young man who dealt with our reservation was excellent, answering queries by email immediately and organising our treatments and restaurant reservations.
The lady who looked after our room could not have done a better job providing us with plenty of White Company toiletries, plenty of fresh towels and bathrobes and slippers.
The food in Redmonds Restaurant was excellent as was the service and the environment. Our spa treatments were carried out by two lovely young ladies who did an excellent job. It was also nice to be able to get ready in the ladies only changing room which was calm and relaxing. Cold drinks and magazines were provided.
It was a wonderful 2 night stay and we will definitely be back.",Date of stay: April 2016,Carden Park Hotel,1,"Broxton, United Kingdom"
Loved it!,"If you have an interest in wildlife then this is the tour for you. We had a fantastic afternoon that went well over the scheduled two and a half hours. We not only got to see the beautiful homes on the island, we also got to see the homes of the other Florida residents including those belonging to Burrow Owls and Tortoises who are clearly used to being visited! We plan to return to the island again next year and will be taking Susan up on her offer of bike tours round olde Naples and the Everglades. The tour was very educational and we would highly recommend it.",Date of experience: February 2016,Sunshine Bike Tours,1,"Marco Island, Florida"
Excellent hotel. Beautiful location,"Stayed for a week from August 16th to 23rd 2015 and have already booked to return next summer. What a fantastic place. The location is stunning. The hotel is beautifully furnished, food is excellent and the staff are second to none. Having read about the 'grumpy' waiter in the restaurant, my friend and I made it our mission to turn him into Mr Happy. It wasn't difficult at all and we quickly found him to be very welcoming and accommodating although he didn't speak English and we didn't speak Spanish which is probably why he doesn't try to engage in conversation, resulting in some reviewers making an unfair judgement of him as he's actually really sweet. Chloe deserves a special mention. She speaks fluent English and fluent Spanish and is a delightful young lady who works in the main restaurant. She always went out of her way to make sure the guests get everything they want as well as what they need. Our room lady also deserves a special mention. We didn't get her name but we were in room 203 so I hope the management read this review and pass on our thanks. The room was thoroughly cleaned every day, she left clean towels every day and was happy to give us some extra English Breakfast teabags when we ran out. Should also mention that the young man in the tourist information hut on the beach speaks excellent English and gave us a map regarding two beautiful coastal walks. Would recommend the one that starts immediately to the left of the hotel as the other one has far too many steps. (We counted 320). It was still worth the walk though, but is not suitable for families with young children..... Don't visit here without taking the bus to Ciutadella. What an amazing place. The bus leaves at 9.45 from the stop in the village and returns from Ciutadella at 4.50. It costs €2.90 each way and doesn't stop in between so the journey takes less than half an hour. Would recommend walking round the beautiful town in the morning, then visiting the cathedral and monastery before walking down to the harbour for lunch by the sea.... This has been one of the best holidays we have ever had. The island and location is stunning and we can't wait to return next year.",Date of stay: August 2015,Melia Cala Galdana,1,"Menorca, Spain"
Heathy lea experience,"We have just returned from a 2 night stay at heathy lea, staying in rooms 2 and 3 which we found to be warm, comfortable and furnished to a high standard including plenty of toiletries, fluffy white towels and an amenity tray that included fresh milk that was in the downstairs fridge. We were told to help ourselves which made us feel very much at home. Other touches included current and past copies of Derbyshire life and a book case on the landing housing the books left by previous guests. Our hosts Clive and Christine made us feel extremely welcome. Clive helped us carry in our luggage and gave us a key so we could come and go as we pleased. Both were happy to share their knowledge and experiences of Chatsworth and surrounding area recommending 2 excellent places for dinner. Breakfast was delicious and included rare breed pork and sage sausages, bacon, mushrooms, tomatoes and fresh eggs, cooked to perfection. I would highly recommend Christine's home made marmalade to go with the toast!
This was our first b and b experience, chosen specifically because it is located on Chatsworth's land. The stroll from the house through the parkland to Chatsworth house was perfect and the scenery is stunning. It takes an additional 10 minutes to walk from Chatsworth house to edensor village which is where the dowager duchess lives and where Kathleen Kennedy is buried. We had afternoon tea here, a delicious selection of home made cakes were on offer served with a lovely pot of tea, all at reasonable prices. The most delightful thing about the village is that the residents set up little stalls outside their homes and leave honesty boxes. items for sale included free range eggs at £1 a box, home made chutneys and jams and home grown vegetables. All much cheaper than in Chatsworth farm shop and probably just as delicious!
If you are looking for a beautiful location, wonderful hosts and a homely environment, I don't think you will be disappointed with heathy lea. Thank you Christine and Clive for making our experience so wonderful",Date of stay: November 2013,Heathy Lea Bed and Breakfast,1,"Baslow, United Kingdom"
