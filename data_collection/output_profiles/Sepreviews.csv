Lovely authentic Indian,"We had a great meal here, all dishes and sides were fantastic, tasted fresh and were delicious. Staff were very friendly too. Don’t be put off by it being on a main(ish) road, you still have a lovely view of the beach/sea and we saw a beautiful sunset whilst having dinner here. Highly recommend for a very tasty Indian!",Date of visit: September 2020,Sartaj Indian Restaurant,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
Beautiful stay,"We stayed here for a week with breakfast included and couldn’t fault it at all. The staff are so friendly and lovely and really give a personal touch. When we arrived a bell boy takes you and your luggage to your room via a golf buggy and we were upgraded which was a nice touch! The buffet breakfast was nice with lots of options, they have staff at every station to serve the food for you due to COVID. The private beach is also beautiful and good for snorkelling! Highly recommend to anyone and would definitely come back again",Date of stay: August 2020,Port Royal Villa & Spa,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
Brilliant trip,"Brilliant day out! It was a lovely relaxed and chilled atmosphere, left at 9am and fished for an hour or so, I think nearly everyone on our trip (9 people) caught a fish! We then stopped at a little bay where you could snorkel round the Ancient caves whilst they barbecued the fresh fish on board the boat! (When we booked the trip we were asked if we wanted chicken or fish so if you don’t like eating fish there is another option) the lunch was delicious and the setting was beautiful it was a great day out.",Date of experience: August 2020,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
