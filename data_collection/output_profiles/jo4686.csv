Brilliant Day!,"Googled fishing in Rhodes and this was rated number one on trip adviser so decided to go with it. We weren’t disappointed, from the fishing to the food to the crew itself we couldn’t say a bad word. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to go out fishing while in Rhodes. Top marks all round from us! Thanks again for a great trip!",Date of experience: September 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Excellent Hotel :) Our Wedding,"We had our wedding here at the weekend and no one had a bad word to say. Food was beautiful, rooms where comfortable and clean, no request was too much for the staff. The attention to detail was excellent and we would be very particular.
We had mixed feelings before the wedding due to the bad reviews that we had read online shortly after we had booked the hotel last year but decided to stick with our initial impression.
We are so glad we did, it is a perfect location for a wedding or just an over night stay with plenty of grounds in and around the hotel and Gracehill House for photos and too explore.
Thank you again to everyone who helped make our day so special, Mr & Mrs Menzies 18-08-2018",Date of stay: August 2018,The Hedges Hotel,4,"Ballymoney, United Kingdom"
