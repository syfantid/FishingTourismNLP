Fishing like never before,This was an absolute treasure of a day. I Was assisted on board by the lovely Efi and Demitriou as I am a bit small and stiff. Coffee and tea were offered before we set out. First to fishing nets where we helped take the fish from the nets to put aside for lunch. Efi explained about the nets and the type of fish we'd caught and then we headed to a cove for a swim while lunch was prepped for us. Another cove for a swim and a clay bath them back to the boat for lunch and it was absolutely delicious. relaxation time before heading back to port. Efi produced lovely home made lemonade. I could not recommend this tour enough. Thanks to all the crew,Date of experience: September 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
If you have time it might be worth it.....,We arrived to order at 12.50. We ordered two quiches and salad and 2 drinks. That drinks arrived quickly enough but by 13.40 despite us asking we left still hungry. No apology just yes yes. It is coming. Well so is Christmas but we were too hungry and pissed off to find out. No apology. Big thumbs down,Date of visit: June 2017,Chocolate House,1,"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg"
Peaceful place to be,"The welcome to the Old School was friendly. I was shown my room (The Science Room) which has two beds, I chose the one closest to the window which was very comfortable. I was brought a tray with tea and biscuits even though there was a kettle and tea or coffee available in the room. Nothing was too much trouble and I felt very comfortable. In the morning the breakfast was served in the amazing dining room. The Old School is a lovely place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone.",Date of stay: March 2017,The Old School,1,"New Cumnock, United Kingdom"
"wonderful location, disappointing result","A friend and I stayed at the beginning of May for a spa break. We arrived early but were invited to use the spa and take our first treatment prior to check in which was fine. We had a swim and lunch in the bar before our first treatment. Good but pricey.
When we checked in we were handed out key and given directions to our room. For the price we were paying I was expecting to be shown to our room. But no we had to go and investigate for ourselves. The evening meal was lovely. We enjoyed a good sleep despite a fire alarm going off near midnight.
Breakfast the next morning was chaotic, which I put down to it being a bank holiday and the hotel was very busy, However of the cooked breakfast the black pudding was overcooked, the bacon cold and tough and the fried egg was uncooked. The buffet had delicious new bread, however it soon ran out of ham and cheese. We asked three times for a second jug of coffee but after half an hour we gave up waiting. At the evening meal the menu had not changed from the previous day except that some of the items on it were not available! The next day breakfast was worse. My friend asked for poached eggs which arrived hard boiled. There was about three slices of ham and no cheese. Nor was there any bread only bagels. I raised this with the assistant catering manager whose answer was ""I know"". Nothing changed.
As we checked out I raised the issue of the poor breakfasts for which I received some sort of an apology and was told that my concerns would be passed on to the General Manager Jody Marshall and that he would be in contact. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and waited for a couple of weeks before writing to him. i am still waiting for a reply a month later.
As a result I am very disappointed in their customer care.

For those wanting WiFi, be aware that you are sharing a very small server with everyone else in the resort",Date of stay: May 2016,Macdonald Forest Hills Hotel & Spa,1,"Kinlochard, United Kingdom"
Invisible,"We were out for a drive on Sunday 27th and my husband told me there was a nice cafe at Highland Safaris and so we decided to stop there for lunch. It was not particularly busy and we sat at a table, had a look at the menu and decided on what we would have to eat, put the menus down and waited to be served, and waited, and waited. I began to wonder if it was counter service as there was a man standing behind the counter and a girl clearing and cleaning tables. We were the only people waiting to be served at this point. The girl was totally avoiding us and eventually started cleaning the table next to us so I asked her if it was counter or table service. ""Oh table service!"" she replied. Can we give you our order? ""I'll be with you in a minute!"" Sorry?, In my experience you take the order if a customer is clearly ready to order and clear the tables while the order is being filled. We were not amused and left and went elsewhere. As a final to this I have to say she was not that good at cleaning tables either as the one we were sitting at was sticky. I have to say I was very disappointed.",Date of experience: October 2014,Highland Safaris,1,"Aberfeldy, United Kingdom"
