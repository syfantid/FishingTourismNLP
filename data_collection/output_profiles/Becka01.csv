"Gutted, not what I expected","Gutted, not what I expected at all! Read so many reviews on the Wigan food reviews group that I was really looking forward to visiting. Had the 2 course Sunday lunch- garlic mushrooms and the Sunday lunch burger. The mushrooms were ok, the ‘burger’ was terrible. Said it came with a Yorkshire pudding ‘bun’ I at least expected it to be a hone made Yorkshire- they were frozen. The burger was dry, the roasties rubbery and the cabbage was the most disgusting thing I’ve ever put in my mouth. I don’t understand why they would put a mixture of spices on veg that’s for a roast. I never leave food but I left quite a lot on that plate. I’ll stick with the old band house for a decent roast in future as they’re outstanding there! We all left rather disappointed if I’m honest.",Date of visit: September 2020,Marty's Kitchen & Bar,1,"Wigan, United Kingdom"
Fabulous day out!,"We had such a fantastic time Yesterday! We arrived early and my partner messaged him
To say we were there so he came early to save us waiting. The captain was kind and patient, especially with me as I won’t ever make a pro fisher! But we had so much fun- even when we caught the puffer fish which was a pleasure to see! Ironically I won’t go in the sea because I’m
Scared of fish touching my feet but my partner and the kids loved going for their swim! The food made for us was so fresh and cooked to perfection! We had such a lovely day. Thank you so much! I would most certainly book this trip again, even if I am crap at fishing ha ha!",Date of experience: August 2020,Captain Manolis Fishing Trips in Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
High energy brilliance,Took the kids for a Christmas surprise. We loved this show from start to finish! Even though we were exhausted I was fully engaged. Cracking theatre too! Was very comfortable in the cheap seats which we aren’t always!,Date of experience: December 2019,School Of Rock The Musical,1,"London, United Kingdom"
A true gem!,"Absolutely outstanding! We found this little hidden treasure on the meerkat app when we were out and about in London. Having never eaten this style of food before I was slightly dubious, I didn’t need to be whatsoever. It’s like a tardis as it looks tiny from the front. It’s like taking a step in to Morocco though. It was wonderful, the atmosphere fantastic and the food and service outstanding. I was that full I thought I would burst, but, I couldn’t stop eating! The staff are brilliant, the food wonderful, and My family loved every minute of it! I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it!",Date of visit: December 2019,Souk,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Really lovely,"Beautiful views, nice atmosphere, spent a lovely few hours in this quaint little town. The views of the acropolis at night were wonderful! I would say if mobility is an issue to give it a miss tho due to the steep hills",Date of experience: August 2019,Village of Lindos,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Just wonderful,"What can I say?
The food
The views
The atmosphere

All just wonderful! We had a more expensive meal in Rhodes and it wasn’t half as good as the one we had there!
I’d highly recommend it!!",Date of visit: August 2019,Mythos All Day Restaurant,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Absolutely fantastic,"I’ll be honest, for what we paid I wasn’t expecting anything special, however, I have never felt as welcomed in any accommodation I’ve ever stayed in in any part of the world. From that first impression I knew we were going to have a wonderful time.
Yes, it may not be the ritz, but it’s clean and in good working order (but for a thousand quid for 4 people in August what can be expected, I’ve stayed in far worse and paid a hell of a lot more believe me!)
I didn’t feel like I was staying in an apartment block, I felt like it was a little community. The atmosphere was wonderful, all the kids played together and I felt like my belongings were safe which is important to me. I thought I worked hard but by jingo, Marietta and her family never stop!
If you’re wanting to stay somewhere that is crazy and lively then pastida isn’t for you, we loved it! The 2nd gyros place is absolutely fantastic and their hummus (which I wasn’t a huge fan of) is absolutely amazing!
I would however recommend you get a car for a few days. We went to the beach, lindos, Rhodes and lardos (for b&b beers and burgers which I would highly recommend as they do a cracking deal). It’s about a 20 min drive to falaraki.
The Greek night in the hotel was fantastic so would recommend that!
All in all, I would highly recommend this place to stay, the hospitality is 2nd to none! A true gem! We have tried to find availability for my boyfriend’s dad to no avail sadly!
Thanks so much Marietta! We loved it! I can’t understand people’s complaints!",Date of stay: August 2019,Marietta Hotel Apartments,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Ace!,"Was recommended this place by a few people. Wasn’t disappointed! Despite being crazy busy, the service was bang on! Dead quick!
Only issue I had was I ordered a latte at the end of my meal and it arrived with no tea spoon so I asked for one and the lad said they had ran out and was a knife ok to stir it with, next moment, the other waiter brought us one. Was a bit awkward like!
On the whole id go again",Date of visit: April 2019,Salvo's,1,"Headingley, United Kingdom"
Grear,"Stayed here for a night with my boyfriend so we could have a kid& dog free night. Few drinks, nice meal etc, and loved it.
A few days before our stay I got an email asking if we’d like to upgrade so we did.
Had the most dreadful nights sleep as it felt like we were sleeping on a slant, so mentioned it at reception when I went to pay for the upgrade so had it waived but on closer inspection the bed was a total wreck, a missing leg and broken frame abs the whole bed was propped up on the extra beds for the kids that were on the room.
I called reception so they didn’t think we had done it and it was checked. To my surprise the total cost of the stay was refunded without my asking.
It’s not the first time I’ve stayed here, and prob won’t be the last.
The new bar is fabulous, had a lovely atmosphere when the football was on. Well done village Leeds north, we were very happy campers! Great customer service!",Date of stay: April 2019,Village Hotel Leeds North,1,"Headingley, United Kingdom"
Fantastic,"Absolutely brilliant, fabulous hosts, apartments beautiful and clean with all the facilities that you would need. Do book the breakfast as Sylvie makes a wonderful one.
Fantastic location, I would definitely stay again!",Date of stay: February 2019,Badstrasse Apartments,1,"Berlin, Germany"
Perfect for the victoria warehouse,"Stayed here as we were going to Kendal
Calling at Victoria Warehouse on NYE. Couldn’t have been more perfect! Loved the hangover kit that was provided in the fridge- was just what we needed the next day.
Lined our stomach in the restaurant before we went out. Was ok and a bit expensive for what it was but did the job. Room was lovely with a view of Old Trafford which my son wasn’t happy about when I face timed him, the only problem I would say is that the shower was crap. It also flooded the whole bathroom as I washed my hair in it. I’ve got long thick hair so it clearly wasn’t made for girls like me. Had to spend ages drying the floor instead of getting ready for our night out.
I would stay there again tho",Date of stay: December 2018,Hotel Football Old Trafford,1,"Stretford, United Kingdom"
Used to be good this place,"Currently staying here and tho the facilities are clean I feel like this site is now run by a bunch of absolute authoritarians. I swear to god it’s easier being at work than dealing with these people. My kid can’t even do Leroy uppies without being told off. The kid is on HOLIDAY for Christ’s sake! I will never bring him back here again...nor will I stay here again EVER! It was a decent site, not anymore. Think the men in red have forgotten what it’s like to be a kid",Date of stay: July 2018,Scarborough Camping and Caravan Club,1,"Scarborough, United Kingdom"
Lovely place,"We stayed in a family swim up room for a week as my brother was getting married. I’ll be honest, there’s no way I’d not have a swim up if I was to go again, was worth the extra few hundred for the peace.
I hated the adult only sections as I’d paid for a full facility, not to be excluded for having a 13 year old, we felt it was rather discriminating when you have spent a lot of money.
Food was excellent mostly but stay away from the prawns as they made me violently ill. When reported to reception, the manager blamed it on me traveling and the ‘heat’. It was hotter in the UK and I travel a hell of a lot so them patronising me like this did my head in!!
Drinks... there’s a huge variety of cocktails etc. However I drink Bacardi, the real stuff, not generic white rum. They don’t serve real bacardi, they have it on show but I know it’s not the real stuff by taste. I ended up taking a hip flask to the bar every night!
The retreat salon, I was going to use for my brother’s wedding day for a curly blow, however, at €57 for a curly blow I ended up driving to San Antonio and paid the grand total of €18.50
Would I go again... deffo, although I most certainly wouldn’t eat the prawns!!",Date of stay: May 2018,Insotel Tarida Beach Sensatori Resort,1,"Ibiza, Spain"
Centrally located,"Location couldn’t be more perfect, literally a few metres off the royal mile so really handy.
Staff are lovely and nothing has seemed too much of a problem for them.

However

I am still here now, in bed, not able to sleep. I have been away since 6:10am as the bed in the new style room is dreadful. The 2 nights I have been here I’ve woken up with neck and back pain due to the stiffness of the bed and pillows. All I want is a decent night’s sleep!

Breakfast is great too tho!",Date of stay: April 2018,Travelodge Edinburgh Central,1,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Expensive and not actually that brilliant,"Spent just over an hour here. The most interesting part was the prison cells. Was really disappointed as it was £48 for my mum, my son and I. Majority of the castle was rather boring. Views spectacular though!",Date of experience: April 2018,Edinburgh Castle,1,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Just brilliant!,"Absolutely fabulous! Didn’t stop laughing throughout apart from the boat bit which we all found pointless.
However, the actors they have as spectacular, obviously enjoy what they do and they are a credit to the attraction! I’ve been to the London site and enjoyed this just as much as I enjoyed the London one! Well worth the money",Date of experience: April 2018,The Edinburgh Dungeon,1,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Lovely for a walk,"Lovely to mooch up and down, take in the atmosphere, listen to the bagpipes and just saunter. Stayed just off the royal mile and thought it was lovely!",Date of experience: April 2018,Royal Mile,1,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
Hen do,"Fantastic hotel if you’re going to Benidorm on the razzle. Just around the corner from the square which was perfect for the group of 30 hens I was in.
Bar staff great at getting involved with the party, and we’re more than helpful which was great.
The hotel hair dressers were great too- spent a spontaneous afternoon in tiki beach bar and wasn’t in a fit state to do
My hair so went to the on site hair dressers who fit me in and did a fabulous curly blow!
Would stay here again no problem",Date of stay: April 2018,Hotel Marina Resort Benidorm,1,"Benidorm, Spain"
Ermmm not the best,"Whilst I appreciate I didn’t pay a lot for my room, I do expect it to be clean and to get to it easily.
I booked it as it worked out cheaper than a taxi back to Wigan after my work’s night out.
Clearly, a girl had stayed there the night before as there was hair clips all over the floor and make up on the pillows, also had a lovely present left in the toilet for me to find.
I would have complained, but, the lift was broken and I was on the 5th floor and wearing high heels, I was also in a rush to get out to meet my colleagues- only intended on dumping my bag and getting straight out.

Location wise, cracking and just what you need for a night out on the lash, it looks d just a bed in fairness, BUT, I deserved a clean room!",Date of stay: December 2017,easyHotel Liverpool City Centre,1,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"
Fab,"Great food, great service and great prices. Nothing to complain about at all and I’d deffo return! Passion fruit daquari was yum!",Date of visit: December 2017,Lunya,1,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"
Fabulous festival not so fabulous security,"Went to Leeds fest with 13 friends. Saw some absolutely outstanding acts inc Bastille, kasabian, Eminem, Circa Waves, Haim, Anne Marie etc, however, the booming caravan til daft of clock in the campsite wasn't great when you're trying to get your head down.
Also, security, or lack of was a HUGE concern, especially in the times we are living in! I didn't see one police staff, the lack of drug dogs were apparent by the number of very young kids off their heads on Ket and the state they were in was a concern.
The only 'security' concern Leeds had was to stop people getting in with their own alcohol! Poor really!!
I had a great time but felt let down by the poor attempt at looking after us during these times and seems like safety wasn't a concern!",Date of experience: September 2017,Leeds Festival,1,"Wetherby, United Kingdom"
Cracking hotel for a school trip,"I have just returned from a 2 night trip with 3 colleagues and 45 students. The hotel was extremely well prepared for us, rooms clean and in an excellent location for everything we needed to do. Wouldn't hesitate to take students there again! Had a lovely view from the room too!",Date of stay: July 2017,Hotel Astoria,1,"Krakow, Poland"
Extremely emotive,"Amy was our guide. She was wonderful, the way she tells the 9/11 story was exquisite!
From St Paul's Chapel round to the museum everything she told us was unbiased and factual.
Could have spent all day in the museum, the tears were shed, think the museum was done really well with very little space for the terrorists that committed the atrocities. A very well done tribute to those lost on that day though!
The only aspect I didn't like was that they sold merchandise. I thought that was bad taste, I have visited Auschwitz and all that is sold there are educational tools such as books and DVDs.",Date of experience: April 2017,Doug Fox's World Trade Center Tour and New York City Tours,1,"New York City, New York"
A must do when in nyc,Soooo glad we went here! So much fun! The friendliest staff in New York and loved my breakfast there. I'd go for breakfast rather than any other meal as the queue was much smaller. Had a great time and would most certainly return!,Date of visit: April 2017,Ellen's Stardust Diner,1,"New York City, New York"
Excellent!,"We took the rickshaw ride round Central Park! Had 2 great guides as we had 2 rickshaws. The lads were excellent, pointing out places of interest and taking us to the most famous landmarks, showing us where parts of films were filmed. Was my favourite part of the city!",Date of experience: April 2017,Central Park,1,"New York City, New York"
Fabulous,"Great location, perfect for Macy's, Empire State Building, Maddison square garden and Times Square etc. We were on the 27th floor so had an amazing view too! Only bad thing I'd say is that the bathrooms were really in need of updating and the bath ran cold water. Would have appreciated tea and coffee making facilities being British instead of having to run over the road first thing in the morning to get coffee and also I've never stayed in a hotel where they charge you to store your luggage. Found that rather strange! All in all tho, great stay!",Date of stay: April 2017,The New Yorker a Wyndham Hotel,1,"New York City, New York"
Wicked day out,Despite having to spend what seemed an age queuing (prob an hour) then going through security (seems a chore but it's better than not having it- sad world we live in really) it was a fabulous day out! Most certainly something to tick off the bucket list! So glad we did it and really did get the weather for it too!! Highly recommended,Date of experience: April 2017,Statue of Liberty,1,"New York City, New York"
It's ok,"Bearing in mind we had been travelling since 3am we were knackered and arrived to be told the room was not ready and to come back for our key at 2pm- standard time so we went to the pool bar and had some lunch. After waiting an hour and a half we went back to collect our key so we could go for a snooze and lo and behold it was still not ready! Wasn't impressed to say the least!

The hotel is nice, extremely clean and I loved that the pool area is closed off until just after nine am so no one is allowed to reserve sunbeds until the area is cleaned- this means you can lay in!

Rosi in the restaurant never stops smiling, she is warm and welcoming and really is an asset to the hotel.

The children's entertainment however isn't as good. Many of the activities were not suitable for my 11 year old extremely active son. Quite often games such as water basketball, water polo and water volley ball were played, in the children's pool and children were asked to leave the area. When I complained, the animacion manager said that there was a pirate party he could join- most certainly not what my boy would do and not suitable for his age range. I said this and he told me that 15 year olds take part in this. I work in a high school and I know that 15 year olds will not dress up as a pirate and prance round the hotel! It seemed that the young kids and the adults entertainment is catered for but not the aged 10+.
The lifeguard is rude and obnoxious. He decides to take the ball off the kids when they were playing nicely with it. I, at this
Point flipped! Told him to hand the ball
Back to which he refused and told me to complain at reception. So I did! They told me that I wasn't the first to complain about him. I asked to speak to the hotel manager, surprise surprise she wasn't in! I asked for the duty manager, there was none! I find this very hard to believe having worked in hotels before!
I left my phone number and asked that she called me... Guess what, she never!!

The hotel is a bit further from the centre than I would have liked. In general we liked it but there were a few things I would have liked to have see such as a table on the balcony as we like to sit round the table on it, no inflatables apart from rubber rings are allowed in the pool so don't waste your money.

Would I return??? Honestly, I'm not sure!",Date of stay: July 2016,Sol Costa Daurada by Melia,1,"Salou, Spain"
Nothing to write home about,"I stayed here as my friend's parents in law have an apartment in Pollensa and we were going to be spending all our time with them- we just literally needed somewhere to lay our head at night and this was the cheapest by a mile.
Saying that it still wasn't cheap to stay there €295 for 4 nights plus taxes! When I pay that kind of money there are certain things I would like. A constant supply of electricity for starters. The electric went up to 8 times a night, it wasn't an area thing as everywhere else was lit etc, one of the times I saw it go off I was in the bar and someone ran off to the fuse box to flip it back on... Clearly the system is being overloaded!
There is no hand soap in the rooms to wash with, that's the first time I have seen that in any place I have stayed!
There is no choice at breakfast at all, you get what you are given (although the lady serving breakfast is a very very lovely lady with a constant smile on her face!), the coffee is really good there too!
The rooms do not get serviced at all! I would have expected them to be serviced once at least during a 4 night stay! When I stayed at Flora down the road in April they were serviced every day (and I know it's seasonally related but I had a 4 night stay inc flights and transfers for 2 people for what I paid for the stay at Borras)!
I found that the rooms and their guests were an inconvenience to the staff downstairs tbh, I asked for an extra pillow and was repeatedly told come back later!
All in all, it's alright, not the best but not the worst most certainly, and it's clean in the public areas too. Would prob stay again if I couldn't find anything else",Date of stay: July 2016,Hostal Borras,1,"Majorca, Spain"
"Great, just what we needed","Stayed here at the weekend as we'd travelled down to see Take That in Hyde Park. Arrived just before ten, easy check in and straight up to the room. The only issues I had were that the minute I stepped out of the lift it was sooooo hot! Had to sleep with the fan on which isn't the best for me. Also, if you're a light sleeper like me it is virtually opposite city airport so the planes woke me up. Obvs it's not the hotel's fault though.
The staff were really lovely, service was excellent. Ordered a pizza when we got back from the gig on the Saturday and I was surprised how nice it was tbh. Would stay there again and have already recommended it to friends- especially at that price! Thanks to everyone who made sure we had a lovely stay!",Date of stay: July 2016,Travelodge London Excel,1,"London, United Kingdom"
As always yum!,"We didn't need a menu as we always visit when we go to London, had the boat trash as usual. The server noticed that we had our suitcases with us and asked if we were in a rush, as we had a train to catch he rushed the order for us. Great food, great service and we will be back on our next trip down south!",Date of visit: July 2016,Bubba Gump Shrimp Co,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Fabulous!,"Took my mum here for 2 nights for her Christmas present. We were delighted with it! Can't believe how little I paid for such a lovely room tbh. It is a deceptive place. Fabulous cocktail bar and our room, 16 was a very good size with a sofa and 2 chairs to chill in which was just what we needed after a silly o clock flight!! We will most certainly stay there again and recommend to others!",Date of stay: June 2016,Spatz Aparthotel,1,"Krakow, Poland"
Just wonderful,"Stunning location! The architecture is totally beautiful! Had a lovely lunch in the sun watching the world go by! Will
Most certainly return!",Date of experience: June 2016,Krakow's Rynek Glowny Central Square,1,"Krakow, Poland"
Very wuirky,"Loved walking around, seeing all the quirky bars, there's something for everyone there! Walked round the market and bought some bits then the live music started on the roof which was fab! Lots of street food being sold there too. There's all kinds of restaurants in the area, glad our hotel was there as it was deffo up our street!",Date of experience: June 2016,Kazmierz The Former Jewish District,1,"Krakow, Poland"
Beautiful,Beautiful building that on the inside reminded me of something off a film which is full of history. We ate in one of the restaurants on the outside of the hall and the lunch was lovely! Will return,Date of experience: June 2016,Sukiennice (Cloth Hall),1,"Krakow, Poland"
Great recommendation,"My cousin recommended this restaurant to us, coincidentally it was on the same street as our hotel. The food was simply Devine! The service excellent and extremely friendly! Even though we arrived an hour prior to our reservation they were more than happy to accommodate us! Fresh ingredients and wonderful results with them! We rolled out of there and were too full for desserts! I would most certainly recommend",Date of visit: June 2016,Trezo Restauracja,1,"Krakow, Poland"
Pleasant surprise,Booked this because my friend was staying in her parents in law's over the road. Was very pleasantly surprised by how modern the apartment was. My little boy was amazed by the fact it had a kitchen ha ha! Had a small issue with the cooler and as soon as I called reception they were straight up to sort it. All in all I'll most certainly be back!,Date of stay: April 2016,Aparthotel Flora,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Beautiful,"Took my boy and my friends nephew for a little wander, stopped for an ice cream which was hoovered up very quickly, then weaved in and out of the shops leisurely before stopping for a coffee. Beautiful place to visit, would highly recommend it",Date of experience: April 2016,Alcudia Old Town,1,"Majorca, Spain"
Fab for £30 a night. I'd stay again!,"Yes it's further out of central London but only a 10 min walk to the tube. Rooms are big, spacious and clean, staff very lovely and the on site parking fab! We will return thanks!
The only criticism I have is that they didn't seem to be able to cope with large number at breakfast. 1st night we stayed the hotel was like a ghost town at breakfast so everything well stocked but this morning breakfast was very busy. There were no yoghurts, eggs, mushrooms and had to wait a very long time for bread to be brought out for toast. One other thing, I didn't see any croissants at all (they did have this featured on the menu!)",Date of stay: December 2015,Travelodge Wembley,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Cracking day out,"Well it would have been better if my boy's friend didn't puke as the smell of chocolate made him nauseous.... The staff were fabulous and really looked after him! The 4d cinema was cracking! The tour is pretty good. Noticed people have moaned on here about the amount of free chocolate you get... 3 different bars on the way in, a medium sized bar half way through then a pot of melted choc with sprinkles too... Greedy springs to mind!! Yes the shop isn't particularly cheap but these places never are! Some people need to smile, it's a great day out and very informative!!",Date of experience: November 2015,Cadbury World,1,"Birmingham, United Kingdom"
Fabulous 90th celebration,"My family visited yesterday for my grandma's 90th birthday as it was half way for us all- us being in wigan and the other half of my family in Bradford.
We couldn't have been welcomed better! My grandma was made to feel like a queen by staff and other diners in the pub! The food was lovely and my Grandma was overwhelmed by how special she was made to feel. I made a birthday cake, which they kept hidden from her (I make a lot of cakes and she was miffed that there wasn't one they hid it so well) so at the end of the meal when they brought it out she was rather surprised! Staff very obliging when we asked them to take a few family photos too!!
Overall, a very warm welcome and a very happy grandma! Thanks folks!!",Date of stay: October 2015,The Turnpike Inn,1,"Rishworth, United Kingdom"
Fabulous,It is simply wonderful. Watching it chilled me out even though the noise was loud and there were thousands of people around me watching it too. Go!!,Date of experience: August 2015,Illuminated Fountain,1,"Salou, Spain"
Fantastic,"What else can I say?? Fantastic! My 10yr old loves the huge rides as do I, so our first ride of the day had to be the Shambala! Loved it! All the big rides were fabulous!
I hate queuing, and think you can waste your day stood in them so I bought the express pass so we could jump the queue. Very reasonable at €27 each.
Loved it! Go!!",Date of experience: August 2015,PortAventura,1,"Salou, Spain"
It's ok,"It's alright. Not the best waterpark I've visited but not the worst. I'd certainly invest in the express wristband as I do hate to queue for rides, it's also nice to walk right on the rides too! Bit overpriced when you're in there but that's what you expect. Think I'll try the other waterpark next time I go to salou tho!",Date of experience: August 2015,PortAventura Caribe Aquatic Park,1,"Salou, Spain"
Fantastic,"Ridiculously expensive. Don't go thinking that you'll get a photo for a fiver... Mine were approx £35 for 3 but I couldn't not get them as my boy was so excited. Thought it was ridiculous that the adults shirts were €20 cheaper than the children's ones but of course I was highly pressured by a really excited 10 year old!
The tour is great, however it is jam packed full of people and in TVs heat it becomes a bit of a sweat box!

I would go again but in the quieter season!",Date of experience: August 2015,Camp Nou,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Great for an hour,"We got in this early evening to do the route. Went round salou up to portaventura and cap salou. Was a great and cheap way to kill an hour, at €3 each you can't really complain. I'd do it again!!",Date of experience: August 2015,Tourist Train Salou,1,"Salou, Spain"
Fantastic food fantastic experience,"We visited twice. First time as it was around the corner from our hotel and the second so my boy could have what he had set his eye on on the menu. He had the seafood platter. It was extremely fresh... In fact he was able to hold the live crab which he was about to eat. Can't get any fresher! Was fantastic, he loved it, very reasonable, would certainly return!!",Date of visit: August 2015,Metropolitan Cafe Salou,1,"Salou, Spain"
Outstanding,"As I went as part of a coach tour we didn't have time to go inside. The queues are approx 3 hrs long. However, from the outside it was spectacular! Totally outstanding! Well worth a visit, I do plan to return to see the interior in the future!",Date of experience: August 2015,Basilica of the Sagrada Familia,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
"Unreal, outstanding, breathtaking!","A must see!! Totally awe inspiring! I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to witness this show! If you're venturing to barcelona you must see this. The atmosphere is electric and I'm so pleased I could see this, and take my son to it!! Make sure you see this!!",Date of experience: August 2015,The Magic Fountain,1,"Barcelona, Spain"
Fabulous fabulous fabulous,"Just flaming wonderful, food excellent, rooms spacious (I would however ask for one that wasn't streetwise though) the spa is just Devine too! Kids club could have done with improvement but we were there the first week it opened. Hoping to go back next easter too!! I would certainly recommend this hotel!!",Date of stay: April 2015,Green Nature Diamond Hotel,1,"Marmaris, Turkey"
Just perfect,"As usual just perfect. Me my 10 year old and our dog love it there, just looking where we can fit the next visit in!! Great views, lovely rooms, constant supply of coffee and fantastic breakfast, this means my boy is happy, my dog is happy which is a great combination to make me happy!! Thanks guys, see you again soon zxx",Date of stay: June 2015,Netherdene Country House Bed & Breakfast,1,"Troutbeck, United Kingdom"
Stunning hotel!,"We booked this hotel for our annual london break through Superbreak.
upon arrival we were taken aback as it was much nicer than the pictures depicted. Check in was not so smooth tho, unfortunately the staff on the desk didn't seem to understand what we were saying when we didn't want to leave a preauthoriseation of our credit card, the girl was rather rude and insisted that all hotels do this- we pay cash at every hotel we stay at for any extras we take so I found her rather insulting. I also mentioned that I used to work for a large hotel chain and wouldn't take a pre auth from guests if they wanted to pay cash for extras. She felt it necessary to ask which chain.... She went rather quiet when I told her it was the Hilton group!!
I spoke about this incident to Rebecca on the next shift who was horrified about how angry I was, she went above and beyond to make us happy! A true diamond to the hotel and if I was the gm I'd be doing everything possible to keep her on my team!!

The rooms are the biggest standard rooms I've stayed in in London, they have been designed to an extremely high standard indeed!! I was in a room with my mum and my 9 year old boy, we weren't tripping up over each other at all!!
Breakfast was lovely, lots of fresh fruit and the infused waters were amazing!!

The thing I'm not so sure about is that the reception staff wear jeans and a polo shirt....looked like they worked in a nursery or kids club, I like to see smartly dressed reception staff.... Maybe that's just me (and the rest of my party)

All in all lovely hotel, great food, and if you're not bothered about hopping on the dlr to travel a bit further for your london break then its a cracking location!we'll be back!",Date of stay: February 2015,Aloft London Excel,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Deeeeeelish!!,"Had to queue for half an hour for a table (sadly this restaurant doesn't take reservations as I had tried to-and the bar was full)
But once we did get seated we had outlet order very quickly indeed! Most of iur party ordered the boat trash, Devine is all I can say, altho I would have like to seen the shrimp available as a steamed option rather than deep fried but that's just me. It was still amazing!! Had a strawberry Louisiana lemonade too which was beautiful and I got to keep the glass too!! We'll certainly be back!",Date of visit: February 2015,Bubba Gump Shrimp Co,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Strange and expensive place,"Went with my mum brother his girlf and my 9 year old son.

Quite possibly the most random place I've ever been.

My brother thought it was complete rubbish!!
For me it's been there, was sort of alright but I wo go back",Date of experience: February 2015,Ripley's Believe It or Not!,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Great family holiday,"If you want everything on complex and not have to go anywhere this is the place for you!
We do like to walk out but couldn't really as it was in the middle of nowhere!
There is loads to keep the kids busy including three fantastic pools and the aqua park, with a great Thomas Cook run kids club on site. Beware though, there are party nights that cost an extra £10 per party. My little boy did the chocolate party which he thoroughly enjoyed but it ruined his t shirt so take some old clothes if you think your child may want to do it!
The beach has several watersports available at an extra cost but they are only approx £3 for the inflatables so we did it a few times and the paracending cost £18 for both of us! I wanted to do it in Ibiza and it was €45 so very cheap indeed!
The spa is lovely, I had a Turkish bath on the first day for approx £10 so again, great value for money.

Tipping is expected, the staff only earn £160 a month and they work very hard for that money so they do deserve to be tipped! They are all lovely and friendly (with the exception of the bar staff on the snack bar who seemed to think that they shouldn't smile or offer table service to us as we weren't with men we thought seeing as the parties with men were constantly receiving table service)! The chefs on the snack bar were lovely, constantly smiling with a great sense of humour, they were great to be around.
The food was ok too, quite often we chose to have lunch in the snack bar as they did fresh pizzas and the best chips we've eaten.
You can eat in the a la carte restaurant once, it's a bit of a pain as you have to book between 9 and 2 but you have to make your menu choices there and then!
The foam party was fantastic, the best night of the holiday, the other entertainment wasn't brilliant tbh, but the animation team are fantastic, working virtually every waking hour and are a credit to the hotel!
We did the market trip. If I'd have realised what it was I'd have just got a taxi to sousse myself. The guide clearly loved being the centre of attention was very overbearing and thought it was ok to smoke in uniform. He took us to a cafe which was very interesting but sat in the corner smoking a shisha. Having been a former rep I know that smoking in uniform is heavily against policy so I was very shocked he chose to do that! He encouraged haggling, which I am very good at, he then jumped in and decided what price my mum would pay for a bag- this was higher than we wanted to pay and I would have got it cheaper had I done it myself!
I need to mention how wonderful our waiter in the restaurant was, I can't remember his name but we had a huge soft spot for him, he was a genuinely lovely guy!
Beware, it's VERY VERY HOT! One day it got to 50!
Would I return??? Yes certainly, but I'd go at a cooler time of the year!
Beware: if you want small and personal hotels this is not the place for you, there's over 3000 guests there, it's HUGE! I love hustle and bustle so I was happy!
The free WIFI was greatly appreciated too! Had a great holiday and hope you do too!",Date of stay: August 2014,Sahara Beach Aquapark Resort,1,"Monastir, Tunisia"
Cheap and cheerful,"Stayed here for a hen do with 7 others. Should have stayed next door but it was a bit of a hovel so we moved.
Just what you're looking for if you're going for the Ibiza experience. Close to the west end, gatecrasher and the beach. Get used to people knocking on the door trying to sell you club tickets but just part and package of it. The fridge in the room came in handy for hangovers as only had to move out of bed to get some cold water!
Didn't have any problems and was nice that the rooms were serviced every day with fresh bedding and towels. A lot cleaner than we expected. As the flight home was late we booked an extra night as there wasn't any scope to keep the room on longer. For what it cost it was well worth it as the q for the shower room was over an hour long!! I'd stay again!",Date of stay: July 2014,Hotel Playasol Marco Polo I,1,"Ibiza, Spain"
Brill,"We went every day for breakfast lunch or dinner. Food excellent for the price, great atmosphere, great staff and fab service! Will be going again on our next visit!",,Ibiza Rocks Bar,1,"Ibiza, Spain"
Far from amazing,"We went to see the sunset, enjoy a few drinks and have a nice meal.
The atmosphere was great, especially when the sun was going down, but the food and service was far from that.
Had to ask three times for a glass of water and really hated my poor meal!
Not sure if I'd go again, maybe for a drink but certainly not for food!!",,Cafe Mambo,1,"Ibiza, Spain"
Festival toilets without the great music!!,"If you love using portaloos and being in a muddy bog a la Glasto take a radio and get yourselves down there.

Seriously, this is THE WORST campsite I've ever stayed in. It's dirty, the toilets are portakabins, the washing up facilities a disgrace and do not have adequate drainage therefore under the portakabins is dirty smelly water.

At £300 for a tent for a week it poses the question what do you actually get for your money. It's disgusting and I will never stay there again!!!!!!",Date of stay: May 2014,Blue Dolphin Holiday Park - Haven,1,"Filey, United Kingdom"
Hilarious,"Great night, mega cheap, didn't stop laughing and have already recommended it to friends! Well worth the money and I'll certainly be going back",,Hot Water Comedy Club,1,"Liverpool, United Kingdom"
Great! For the small time spent there,"I've just taken my little boy here as part of visiting York for the Viking festival and left feeling rather miffed. It's 20 years since I visited and ten years since I worked round the corner but I remembered the queues being HUGE for this place at weekends and during the holidays so thought it would be worth a visit.
A very expensive half hour that was!
We booked tickets online so saved ourself from the queues but we couldn't believe how quickly we were round it- and we stopped to read everything too!!
Do not plan for this to take up your day/morning/afternoon but still worth a visit",,Jorvik Viking Centre,1,"York, United Kingdom"
Cracking steak,"I went to the fat olive last night with a bunch of colleagues and had a rump steak. I don't normally eat rump as I tend to find it tough, it was anything but! Lovely and juicy and tender and melted in my mouth.
We ate off the 2 courses for £12 (ish) menu, I really enjoyed my meal! Shall be returning!

Thanks",,Fat Olive Wigan,1,"Wigan, United Kingdom"
About time,"Just what we needed in Ash!!
Had a cracking meal! Have recommended to several colleagues already! Cracking burger and the kids menu is extremely good value! Well done!!",,The Fat Bull,1,"Ashton in Makerfield, United Kingdom"
Great!!,Stayed here to do a site inspection for a school visit to Disney. Cracking! Can't understand the negatives to be honest! To be honest the only bad points were no kettle in the room and the wifi was temperamental. Beds wets cracking and as a person who doesn't sleep very well in beds that aren't my own I had a fab nights sleep! I'd certainly take my little boy to stay here. The shuttle to the park was regular and had no probs at all!! Great great great!!,Date of stay: January 2014,Campanile Val de France,1,"Magny-le-Hongre, France"
Wicked!!,"Have visited three times this week and loved it!
My little boy loved the Warwick Warriors, Horrible Histories actors, the birds of prey displays, the firing of the trebuchet and the jousting!
It's a great day out, and to those that moan about the cost, simple- get a buy one get one free voucher- they're everywhere!!! It's not expensive at all- I've just returned from France and paid €15 to just park my car at Disneyland Paris and €10 at Parc Asterix- where it was four quid for an ice cream! If you don't like the price go to your local park! It's free!!
Seriously tho, we loved it, will prob be back in the October hols! Cheers folks!!!",Date of experience: August 2013,Warwick Castle,1,"Warwick, United Kingdom"
It's ok,"Camped here for three nights so we could go back to Disney and visit Parc Asterix on our way back from Holland.
It's ok, not a 4* tho by any means. The toilets are cleanish but there is no soap or facilities to dry your hands whatsoever! I think that's a basic right when paying €30 a night to pitch a tent!
The snack bar was good, food reasonably priced, me and my little boy had a pizza each, wish we'd have shared one as they were huge!!!!
Beware, the shop is extortionately priced! Take things with you if you don't enjoy being ripped off,.. Also take hand washing liquid just in case... Had to wash a jacket that my little boy had bought and got chocolate all over in Disney and the machine cost €4.50 and a euro for the liquitab!!
If camping beware the ground is very hard to put pegs in!
Took 50 mins to get to Parc Asterix and 35 to Disney... Not as close as the websites state!
If going to the parks take LOTS of money- it's €10 and €15 just to park!!!
Overall good stay, not sure if I'd return tho!",Date of stay: August 2013,Camping Le Village Parisien,1,"Varreddes, France"
It's ok,"Didn't stay in the hotel but went to the water park, was alright but not the best indoor water park, the Sandcastle at Blackpool was miles better, but Splash Landings is pretty much Chav free so both have their plus and minuses!
I'd go again tho",,Alton Towers Waterpark,1,"Alton, United Kingdom"
Wonderful,"We came back early from our little break here not due to LMTP, wholly down to Mother Nature and my crap tent!

Had an excellent few days here, just me and my little boy. Stunning location, the cleanest campsite I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. Beautiful bathroom facilities, modern and spotless, lovely play area and perfect for Alton Towers, we are annual pass holders so can see us returning several times!
Thanks so much for the warm welcome and flexibility when I wanted to change my booking- I've recommended you several times to my many camping Facebook friends!",Date of stay: July 2013,Lower Micklin Touring Park,1,"Denstone, United Kingdom"
Great Value,"It was perfect for what I wanted which was to go to the O2, two mins walk from Blackwall DLR station and lovely and clean. I have to say it was great value for money, £65 inc breakfast for myself and little boy... Bargain! Will definitely be staying there again!",Date of stay: July 2013,Ibis London Docklands Canary Wharf,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Great day out!,"We went Easter Sunday with my seven year old, we will be coming back! The interactive horrible histories attractions were fantastic and the actors were brilliant! It was nice to see one of the actors from Camelots jousting from my school trip last yr!
Tips- take your own picnic, the food was diabolically dreadful and very pricey! Don't think that you've paid to get in so you can see everything, there are additional pay for entry attractions when you get inside!
However, we found the souvenirs to be very reasonable, my son bought about five different things for less than his £15 Easter money!
Great day out, we will be returning as we've decided to get an annual pass and spend our summer around the uk visiting the attractions accessible with the pass!",Date of experience: March 2013,Warwick Castle,1,"Warwick, United Kingdom"

Fantastic day out!,"Something for everyone, unlike Alton towers they aren't baying for your cash at every given opportunity, I'm very impressed and even at the height of summer the queues aren't ridiculous!

We were told no noise after 10;30 and at 10:31 luke came with his torch and told us to quieten down, even tho were weren't that noisy! We were just sat in the hot tub talking!! No mobile signal whatsoever so we all felt like we'd had a limb amputated until we went for a drive out!!

Great place to stay for families having a short break in London!!!!!",Date of stay: February 2012,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Basic But Great,"Great hotel, staff more than friendly, can't do enough to help you! The rooms are basic but at the end of the day it is a two star hotel in a third world country! Given that though my room was HUGE! They are basically like an apartment without the kitchen. Air con and fans in the rooms, dining table with cable tv and some comfy chairs in the living area, and a fully stocked fridge! The rooms were cleaned every day (which is a good job as I had a 2 year old with me!). We had room 002 which was great for two reasons, there was no noise and it was completely in the shade so the room never got uncomfortably hot at any time. I was aware of the toilet roll factory at the back but in that room you don't really see what's going on in the building behind!
The waiters are fantastic, we had another 2 year old with us and they were always playing with the boys, Sunny in housekeeping was wonderful and was very quick to wash our clothes when we asked him to do so, they would always come back immaculate and it was dirt cheap to have them washed! Our partyhad loads of beauty treatments done on site, best pedicure ever for about a fiver and I also used the on site tailors and had some beautiful clothes made!
Fantastic food in the restaurant- mega cheap too! Stayed in the hotel one day (all day), had food and drinks for 2 inc lunch and dinner for less than ten quid!
Five minute walk from the beautiful Calangute beach! What else do you need? Great holiday! Can't wait to go back!
(But I would steer clear of the entertainment as the singers were dreadful!)
Oh and the staff decorated the pool area for christmas, it looked lovely!
