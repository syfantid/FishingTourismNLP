Very Nice tour !!!!,"My boyfriend and I wanted to see the traditional fishing in santorini ! They showed us the way they were doing it ! The cages and nets. It was a great learning experience. I had the chance to help them cleaning the fish while my boyfriend was fishing with a rod. It was so much fun! And then they cooked the fish old Greek style with lots of vegetables, salads,shrimps etc. with wine, beer, ouzo and soft drinks. We had the chance to go snorkeling and swimming! And the best at the end... Santorini sunset on the water ! Spectacular Anthi ,George and the capitan were very friendly, kind and available to answer all our questions. P.S. The price is very decent compared to the other tours ! I recommend this tour to everyone. :)",Date of experience: October 2016,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,5,"Santorini, Greece"
