This was the highlight of our trip,"We travel to Kefalonia yearly. This time we were hosting family from New York and wanted to do something different. Captain Mihalis, Antonia, and Hassan made this outing the highlight of our trip. We enjoyed swimming while they prepared an amazing meal from the catch of the day. This is what it's all about: family, food, and amazing memories.
I highly recommend booking this trip.",Date of experience: July 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
