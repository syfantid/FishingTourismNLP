Best day of our trip,"This was a fantastic day on a fishing boat, led by a great captain Andreas, who was capable and friendly.
First we watched as they pulled in the net, filled with (delicious) fish we would later eat. Other very tasty Greek snacks were also provided.
Followed by a tour of multiple islands, including the most amazing deserted beach.
We are very happy we chose to go out with Poseideon! We highly recommend.",Date of experience: September 2019,Explore Milos with PoseidonÂ®,5,"Milos, Greece"
