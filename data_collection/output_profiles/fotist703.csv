Good sushi food,We run into this place while walking around Syntagma area. There was an offer due to Black Friday and we decided to jump in. The personnel was very polite and help us to do the right choices. We tried 3 different rolls and all were very delicious. We had also edamame and wakame which were also very good. Prices were very decent.,Date of visit: November 2018,Ikura Sushi Bar,4,"Athens, Greece"
Excellent view and food,"We were very lucky to get a table by the veranda. Yes the view was incredible. We ordered the artichoke salad to start and it was good but not something special, however when our two main dishes came, we were in shock of how unique and good they were. We got the beef with eggplant puree and the pork woth prunes. Fot rhose two dishes and the view, im giving it a 5 stars. Service was ok.",Date of visit: September 2018,Agnanti,4,"Skopelos, Greece"
Great atmosphere and food,"We had the pork belly and the special of the day which was ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach with fresh salmon. This last one was was good but the pork belly was extraordinary. Service was good however at the beginning we were ignored for about 5’+ , we almost left but at the end we stayed.",Date of visit: September 2018,Olivo,4,"Skopelos, Greece"
Daily boat trip around Skiathos,"There were many options in the port, but we were looking for something special and different. We got a proposition from our hotel to choose the specific boat with Dimitris as our captain. We didn’t even ask where we were going. We fully trusted Dimitris. The first impression of the boat was excellent. Special decoration and a very warm welcome from him giving us the feeling we knew each other for long time. We started our trip on time visiting a small island opposite the port. We had time to dive, enjoy the sun and the wild life of the isolated island. Dimitris also dived to our surprise. As we found afterwards, he wanted to collect oysters and sea urchin for our lunch later on. We left the small island enjoying a very delicious croissant on board that Dimitris offered to us. While moving to our second stop we start fishing. In the end we had 2 tuna and a great lunch prepared by our captain. We stopped in super beautiful spots to enjoy our lunch, our drinks and have fun. Dimitris was a unique host.
In general, an unforgettable boat trip. Dimitri, thanks a million for everything.

Cozzi cafe,"We visited this place almost every day during our 5days stay in Skiathos. Excellent and very elegant coffee place with high quality products, nice music and great service. All Personnel very polite. Many choices for breakfast or light lunch, like omelettes, croissants, sandwiches, pies etc.",Date of visit: September 2018,Il Posto,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Excellent food and prices,"We came here twice, the crepes are great and we also tried the yogurt with fruits nuts and honey which was delicious. On a very hot day you can also try the lemonade with ginger, it is very refreshing. From all the places we ate breakfast in Santorini, this one had the best prices and more variety. They offer crepes, waffles, fruit salads, smoothies, juices, yogurt, etc. The view is breathtaking, they have limited outside seating though.",Date of visit: July 2016,Vitrin Cafe Creperie,4,"Santorini, Greece"
