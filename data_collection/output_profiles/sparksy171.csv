"""NEVER GO BACK, mis-managed disaster""","Where to start........ Family holiday, 3 adults, 3 children aged 1, 4 and 13 with 2 family rooms booked. On arrival we were told they didn't have rooms for us.....yet again overbooked. After heated conversation we were sent to another Hotel, this was ok, they couldn't do enough for us but it wasn't what we had booked. Three days later went back to look at 2 allocated rooms in the Gelina Village Hotel, 3 hours later we were transferred back to the Hotel with all our luggage only to be told they only had 1 room for us. Eventually 4 hours later they found us 2 rooms , not what we had booked but would suffice, we just wanted to spend the rest of our holiday enjoying the sun and not hotel reception areas. Rooms could of been cleaner.
Two female reception staff were so rude, they even smirked and laughed when holiday guests were being told they had no rooms.
Food was ok, lots of pushing and shoving from some of the other International guests who must of thought they were going to run out of food.
Bar staff very limited, one bartender and 2 glass collectors at every bar to cater for approx 1300 people, totally inadequate in 40 degree heat.
Mosquitoes....don't have a solution for these little mites, we tried everything there was to buy. this hotel does not fumigate for the horrible creatures.
Animation team were very good and friendly and definitely earn their money.
Life guards.....well i think that's what they were, if you call being on your mobile for lengthy conversations and sat behind a display board out of sight of the pool. It only took them about 5 minutes to realise there was a turd alert in the pool and then the pool was closed for about 2 hours.
The Waterpark was handy......well for our last 3 days anyway, but could really do with a good deep clean and refurb.
Attempted to go to a show one night but lasted about 2 minutes before we were eaten alive by the mosquitoes.
Transfer to Hotel was terrible, we had to wait nearly an hour before our bus arrived to take us to the Hotel. On return to the airport we were picked up five and a half hours before our flight time.
We can honestly say our holiday was ruined by this inadequate service. This Hotel is totally mis-managed and we shall not be returning or recommending to others.
We go on holiday 3/4 times a year all over the world, this is the worst one by far.

Good holiday but beware of the secret melon stealers.,"We went 25/5/13 we got there late met mr manos a good man, was shown to bungalows just across the road , we travelled with friends, no lights in bathroom, manos quickly sorted some lights out and was mended next day .well first morning wife and I went for breakfast and thought this is not good any way after eating and putting our towels out ,a phone call from our friends asking where are you? We said breakfast why ? Reply came your at wrong hotel were sat with manos . After making a discreet retreat we found our hotel after much laughter we settled down for our hols. Right review time accommodation good everything you need is in rooms pool view rooms are better.
