Perfect sweets in a beautiful outdoor space,"Before I go to this cafe - patisserie, I had heard it is famous about its ""galaktompoureko"", ""sokolatopita"" and ""portokalopita"". I had the chance to visit it just 2 times and I confirm the fames about galaktompoureko and sokolatopita - I needed a 3rd one to taste the portokalopita.. Both were fresh and tasty! Especially the galaktompoureko I had the chance to eat it hot and it was unbeatable. But, honestly, whatever was in this shop, seemed delicious! They have also sealed products, ready to gift them! And as I saw you can enjoy a breakfast there, at their traditional, cool and so beautiful yard! When I visit Milos again, I 'll go to kivotos again and again and again... Congratulations to its owners! Great job!",Date of visit: August 2020,Kivotos ton Gefseon,4,"Milos, Greece"
A fantastic cruise in Polyaigos! Perfect hosts!,"We were in Kimolos just for two days and we were wondering if it's worth to go to Polyaigos. Thankfully we went and we enjoyed not only the pure turquoise water of Polyaigos sea but also a real fishing experience, guided by Mr Nikos and Mrs Froso, who do this job for years and know everything about fishing! They are two perfect hosts who made us feel like our home from the first moment. We had the chance to see the whole process of picking the net together with all the fresh fish were being caught, clean them and, undoubtedly the best part, eat them!! After enough stops at the best spots around Polyaigos, where we could swim, dive and relax, we ate the ""kakavia"" meal, made by Mrs Froso. A soup with all these fish inside. It is rare to find it and it was so delicious! They served it to us with ""skordalia"" (kind of garlic sauce), salads and fresh bread. I also liked that they were just 10 people in the fishing boat and we were like company. As Mr Nikos told us they take 12 people max. The price is 80 euros per person, but it's not expensive if you think that snack, beverages, main meal, fruit and sweet are included and the duration is about 8 hours. Don't lose this trip if you are in Milos or Kimolos. Highly recommend it!",Date of experience: August 2020,Milos Fishing Experience,4,"Milos, Greece"
Unique tastes in a beautiful space!,"It is a spacy, beautiful and atmospheric restaurant, where inside dominates the stone, as construction material, with an unusual impressive fireplace and outside is a well-cared spacy garden with colorful plants around. When we arrived, it was almost full in both indoors and outdoors, with a few empty tables, so we uncertainly sat, not knowing how much time we would wait.. Surprisingly the service was fast and we ordered and ate faster than we expexted. The food was really delicious! We chose a salad, the local dish ""plastos"", which is a pie stuffed with feta cheese and greens, served with yogurt. Perfect and quite light! Our two main dishes were meat.. Pork shank with honey and mustard served with fried potatoes and boar with plums and apricots served with wild rice. Both were fantastic! For a dessert, they treated us chocolate and vanilla ice cream, with tasty topping of homemade (as we got informed after we asked) berry sweet. The staff was polite and willing to satisfy us and the prices normal. It has something special! Go!!",Date of visit: October 2019,Fagotopi,4,"Pezoula, Greece"
Delicious traditional tavern,"We ate to ""903"" tavern tonight, after we read its good reviews in tripadvisor. Î™t satisfied us! We ordered ""903"" salad, which was delicious and big enough, ""galotiri"", a traditional cheese, which looks like yogurt but is much tastier and the two top main dishes. Veal cheeks and shank lamb with fresh herbs. Both dishes were cooked perfect. Such a soft meat, that you can cut it even without a knife! Both dishes were served with fried potatoes and rice. The staff was friendly and polite and the prices normal, probably cheap regarding its quality. It's really worth!",Date of visit: October 2019,903,4,"Karditsa, Greece"
An interesting choice!,"We tried to go twice at ""Familia"" restaurant but it was impossible without booking a table, especially if you want to enjoy a dinner there! So we booked a table, as the reccomendations we had for this specific restaurant were many and excellent.
In my opinion, it is a good, gourmet, restaurant with special dishes, which fuse the local with the international. We ate delicious fried potatoes, greens, that needed to be boiled more time, at least for my taste and two also tasty main dishes. Beef slices, boiled in a sauce with mashed vegetables and ""kontosouvli"" (large chunks of pork marinated, then skewered and secured by a rod and slow-roasted over an open charcoal pit) on a pie. Foe dessert we chose blueberry cheesecake, which could be better. Genarally, the portions' size were normal to small and it's a bit expensive. The restaurant has a really beautiful atmosphere outdoors, where we sat and the staff was polite and friendly. I recommend it!",Date of visit: August 2019,Familia,4,"Kythira, Greece"
Good quality fish tavern next to the sea!,"I wanted sea food, somewhere close to Athens, in order to combine it with a small trip and the first option came into my mind was ""to koutouki tou Perikli"", in Chalkida. I had eaten some years ago and I liked it! My second visit there, was as good as the first. A great variety of fresh sea food, cooked with different ways depending on the customer's preferences. We ordered ""shellfish saganaki"", which had a perfect mustard sauce...dip the roasted bread they serve! Delicious! Moreover, breaded shrimps with mayo, ""tiropitari"" (kind of cheese pie), fried squids, greens and spaghetti with crawfish. We were satisfied! Service was really fast and the staff was polite and helpful. Normal prices, maybe could be a little bit cheaper.. Its location is an extra plus!",Date of visit: September 2019,To Koutouki tou Perikli,4,"Nea Lampsakos, Greece"
A guaranteed ice-cream!!!,"""Fatto a mano"" is the best ice-cream I've ever tried! I chose a cone with gold chocolate, Madagascar's vanilla and pistachio. All the flavours were perfect. The cone, too. Fresh n' crispy! It has a variety of flavours and all of them must be equally perfect. Try it definitely!",Date of visit: June 2019,Fatto a mano,4,"Peristeri, Greece"
Much more than a cafe!,"The first impression when you see ""I Cafe"", is that it's a cafe, as many others, which will have the usual snacks. But, that's not true! It has a great variety of dishes anytime! Even you go for a brunch, for a dinner or whatever, the choices are many, decent at taste and the portions really generous. We ordered a club sandwich served with potatoes and pancakes with slices of fried crispy chicken with chilli and parmesan sauce. Both dishes were perfect! I'm sure ""I 's"" menu can satisfy anyone! Another plus is that it's spacious, modern and well-decorated and the waiters/waitresses are polite and helpful. I'll go again and again for sure!",Date of visit: May 2019,I Cafe Bar,4,"Argyroupoli, Greece"
"Delicious food, almost on the beach!","We went 5 people for lunch on Good Friday and we 're lucky that find a table. Most of the tables were full or reserved. We ordered an amazing salad, ""Polihni"", and tirokafteri for appertizers, which were accompanied by roasted bread with olive oil and oregano and for main dishes seafood spaghetti, spaghetti with shrimps, cream and safran, filet of chicken with fried potatoes, greens with mixed boiled vegetables and skordalia. Generally the food was really good. I would prefer a more spicy tirokafteri and my small complaint..they forgot to bring me my kalamarakia!! It was my first desire when I went there! A portion of fresh, fried kalamarakia... I was seeing them come and go but they never stop to me... It's never mind! Happens some difficult days with so many people to serve! The waiters and waitresses were happy, polite and in the end they offered us ""halva"" as a dessert. Good price! Bonus: the sea is next to you!",Date of visit: April 2019,Myrtoon,4,"Leonidio, Greece"
"Perfect coffee, snacks & sweets","Whatever you eat or drink at ""hopper's"" is fantastic! Perfect coffee, juices, salads,omelettes, sandwiches, cookies, cakes, croissants and other so delicious things. Ideal for a quick, ""informal"" but still great meal! The ingredients are always fresh and good quality's. So, if you walk around Megaro Mousikis area, go and try it! You won't regret it. Higly recommend it!!",Date of visit: April 2019,Hopper Cafe,4,"Athens, Greece"
"""Tasty"" wine-bar in the centre of Athens!","One week ago, we booked a table to the famous wine bar ""by the glass"". It is located in the centre of Athens and its entrance is in a beautiful and well-decorated covered walkway. You can seat either outdoors (in the covered walkway) or indoors, where is also atmospheric. Apart from the big variety of wines, it has very good and gourmet food and that's why we decided to go there. For a good dinner! We ordered as starters ""kantaifi"" shrimps with sweet&sour sauce and ""talagani"" and gruyere cheese croquettes with cherry tomatoes sauce. Both dishes were tasteful. Especially the croquettes were the best I've ever tried. You bite the crunchy outside part and the hot melt cheese flowed from inside. It's, undoubtedly, perfect! For main dishes, we chose risotto with salmon and quinoa with slices of tuna, which also satisfied us. Last, our dessert was two pies with a superb white creme inside. We drunk a glass of wine and a beer. The lady who served us was a professional. When I didn't know what wine I wanted, she suggested one, after 2 simple questions. It was exactly what I wanted at that time. Regarding the portions of the main dishes I think they could be a little bit bigger and the prices could be a bit cheaper. The beautiful environment's combination with the delicious tastes, attracts you to go again and again!",Date of visit: March 2019,By The Glass wine bar & bistrot,4,"Athens, Greece"
Homemade sweets & ice-cream in a cosy cafe!,"We got by chance to the picturesque village of Karitena and decided to stay for food n' coffee. When we finished our food, we chose the most beautiful and cosy cafe in the village, between 4-5 overall. That was ""Arktos"". A two floor atmospheric building made by stone and small details of wood. Despite we were stuffed, we ordered 3 sweets, in order to shared them (we were 5 persons). We couldn't resist to the waitress' tempting description, who was also the ""creator"", as she told us. An apple pie, a cheesecake and a juicy chocolate cake were our choices, each one with a scoop of ""kaimaki"" ice cream. The apple pie's version was not the usual one, which look like a cake, but it was a tart with apple pieces on it. The juicy chocolate cake was full of chocolate, as it should of course. All the three sweets and the ice-cream were fresh and really delicious. If you go to Karitena's village, go to ""Arktos"" cafe and enjoy its homemade and delicious sweets. It will be a pity to lose that taste!",Date of visit: March 2019,Arktos,4,"Karitena, Greece"
It's worth!,"We went to Londou Fish tavern in Corinth on 25th of March. We wanted to eat sea food and according to reviews, that one was by far the best downtown. We ordered fried potatoes, boiled greens, cuttlefish boiled in their own fluids and, the tavern's popular dish, spaghetti with shrimps, for 2 persons. That dish was perfect and surprisingly the spaghetti was ""al dente"", which is difficult to find it in Greece. The already peeled shrimps (you just need to remove their heads and tails with a simple, light movement) were big with an intense taste and the quantity of fresh tomato sauce was enough in order not to cover the other tastes. The fried potatoes was delicious, but ok, it's common. Greens were tasty but, personally, I would like them more well-boiled. Regarding the cuttlefish, it was my first time I tasted it without other ingredients and it didn't satisfy me much. It had a strange taste for my tastes, so I don't have a clear opinion about this dish. However, it's really impressive with its totally black color! The prices are good, the waiter is friendly and helpful and the service as fast as it should. I suggest Londou tavern! Go, order spaghetti with shrimps and other special dishes - as I remember from the menu, it has enough! I 'll do the same!",Date of visit: March 2019,Londou Fish Tavern,4,"Corinth, Greece"
