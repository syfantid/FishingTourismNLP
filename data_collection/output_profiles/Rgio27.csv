LOOK NO FURTHER! THIS IS A MUST!!,"From the moment Antoni and his father Kyriakos picked us up my wife and I realized this was going to be an authentic memorable experience. We have touched many a seas, be it the Mediterranean, Caribbean, Atlantic, Pacific or the Gulf of Mexico, BUT NONE AS MEMORABLE AS THIS!! Kyriakos could have easily been mistaken as the Greek version of Jaws’ Captain Quint while his son Antoni translated making us feel like we were part of their family. Like true Greek Gods, eating our freshly caught grouper and Red Mullet while drinking homemade wine under the Agean sunset was the pinnacle of our vacation. Oh and lest not forget. THEIR SURPRISE!! (READ NO FURTHER IF YOU LIKE SURPRISES)...........................
.......Listening to Antoni, a Master degree violinist and Kyriakos perform a private concerto was the icing on the kèik!! YAMAS!!!!!!!!!!",Date of experience: August 2019,Flora Fishing Tours,5,"Santorini, Greece"
