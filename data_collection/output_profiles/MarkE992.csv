Batter like soggy Yorkshire pudding,£14 for two pieces of fish which were wrapped in what was supposed to be crispy batter but was more like inedible soggy Yorkshire pudding + one portion of chips which was measly to say the least. All served up by an unfriendly individual. Needless to say we won't return.,Date of visit: October 2020,The Old Smithy,1,"Ambleside, United Kingdom"
Bring back the Queens,We just went in for a drink as we used when it was the Queens Hotel. Although the bar was nothing special the Queens served wonderful local cask beer at sensible prices. Now they serve generic ale which I could get anywhere in the country at just short of £5 a pint and also charge a staggering £9.25 for a glass of wine. I now take my custom down the road to the Lily bar where they serve excellent ale at a more affordable price.,Date of stay: October 2020,The Ambleside Inn,1,"Ambleside, United Kingdom"
Is this the best restaurant in Dalyan?,"Is this the best restaurant in Dalyan? If its not I'd love to find it!!

The restaurant is a few minutes walk from the main Dalyan hub but worth seeking out.

The meze dishes comprised a help yourself buffet for a VERY reasonable price and comprised of many dishes which weren't on other restaurant menus. An excellent start to an exceptional meal.

When the owner of this relatively new establishment spotted I was drinking raki he suggested I try some complimentary local cheese to accompany it. How could I refuse such an offer and the three cheeses he produced were indeed excellent.

The main dishes were very generously-sized portions. I had salmon fillet, which was possibly the best I've ever tasted, accompanied by fantastic chips and dressed salad which was ideal. My wife had oriental noodles which were again exceptional [enough for three people!!]. With drinks this meal cost the equivalent of under £27. A high quality bargain in anybody's book.

The service was friendly and very professional with the owner [sorry, can't remember name] and his wife always keeping a watchful eye on things.

Highly recommended and we will be back.

Just a suggestion. I can't find a listing in the ""Restaurants section"" on Tripadviser so maybe needs to have a separate listing there.",Date of stay: July 2019,Hotel Dalyance,1,"Dalyan, Turkey"
Wonderful eating experience...,"We ate twice [one evening, one lunch] at this fantastic riverside restaurant and both times had wonderful food overlooking the river watching the turtles and various other creatures coming and going.

The food could not be faulted. Starting with home-made bread followed by various tasty mezes before the authentic Turkish main courses served expertly by the ever-smiling Arif and his team.

Although it was very quiet on both occasions because of the location this made it all the more memorable.

Arrangements can be made for pick up and drop off for evening meals and for the lunchtime visit we caught a dolmus to the turtle sanctuary [definitely worth a visit] and stopped at the restaurant on the way back, ate a fantastic lunch after which one of the staff waved down a dolmus [which go past every 30 minutes] so we could continue back to Dalyan. A great way to spend a leisurely half day!!!

So two memorable meals, which we will definitely repeat when next in Dalyan.",Date of visit: July 2019,Golbasi Restaurant,1,"Dalyan, Turkey"
Wonderful stay with great hospitality,"This hotel is an oasis of rural calm just 10 minutes from the airport. On arrival you are greeted by one of the very friendly, super efficient receptionists, Kristina or Krista, depending on the time of day, who will show you to your room via the huge pool, which is immaculately kept [and very warm].

Our room was plenty large enough for the two of us with a small, very basic kitchen but it did have the all-important full-size fridge and a kettle. Room was serviced every day with a bed/towel change once during our one week stay.

The WiFi all round the property was excellent. There was a separate router in each room so you were never out of range whereever you were.

All the staff, especially reception and bar, were really friendly and went out of their way to help. We did find the bar prices to be on the pricey side and its a shame they don't do more food other than basic bar food. We also thought the breakfast wasn't great for the 12 euros it cost. Undercooked eggs which sat in the serving dish for too long and no fresh juice, though there was plenty of fruit, bread etc.

The nearest beach [with two excellent tavernas] is a 15 minute walk or a quick three minutes in the car. The hotel will take you there and back in the evening if you fancy a meal in the tavernas. There are a couple of other eating places within a 10-minute walk but other than that you do need a car to find alternatives, but having your own transport is definitely worthwhile to explore this beautiful island further afield.

To sum up: a wonderful week in lovely surroundings with great hospitality from staff both in the hotel and all the surrounding restaurants. We will return.",Date of stay: July 2017,Avithos Resort Hotel,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fun day at sea,"We had a great day's fishing with Antonia and her family. It was fascinating to see the 2km of nets being hauled in and the array of fish that came up with them.

These fish were then cooked to perfection and after a pre lunch swim were served to us along with home-made salads and dips [not forgetting Antonia's wine] - delicious.

All-in-all a lovely relaxing day along with some other like-minded travellers who were great company.",Date of experience: July 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
"Fantastic location, great staff","We visited the Turiya late September/early October when the hotel was very quiet and we were treated more like family than customers of the hotel.

Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, especially Kenan the manager and Methap on reception.

The rooms are very well appointed and comfortable with fantastic sea views with the best sunsets you'll ever see although the rooms directly over the pool afford the best uninterrupted views.

There is a jetty adjoining the hotel which is fantastic for sun bathing and swimming or there is a good size pool with plenty of sunbeds if you prefer. There is also an indoor pool and gym which we didn't use because the weather was so good during our stay. The hotel is in a quiet location but only a 5-10 minute walk into town.

All-in-all the hotel gets a big thumbs up if you want a quiet, quality, relaxed hotel with excellent staff and great facilities.",Date of stay: September 2012,Veltur Turiya Hotel and Spa,1,"Turgutreis, Turkey"
