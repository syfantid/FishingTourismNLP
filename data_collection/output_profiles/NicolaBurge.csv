Authentic Boat Trip,"My husband and I (both 28 years old) were keen to see Poliegos as we heard it is beautiful. We heard about Nikos and his fishing experience from Dionysus at Rakomelo (another place in Pollonia you should definitely check out for their breakfast buffet - delicious!). There are a lot of ‘fancier’ yachts and catamarans you can book but to be honest, this trip is incomparable. We were lucky enough to have the boat to ourselves and Nikos and Frosa soon felt like family.
We were able to watch the whole fishing process and swim at some of the most beautiful beaches in the world - in crystal clear blue water. Nikos and Frosa explained all the places, what we were seeing and where we were going to next and eating the fresh fish meal on board was soooo good! We are not fishermen by any stretch but this was one of the highlights of our two-week trip - an authentic, intimate Milos experience! Highly highly recommend for young families, couples (young and old) and small groups.",Date of experience: May 2019,Milos Fishing Experience,5,"Milos, Greece"
