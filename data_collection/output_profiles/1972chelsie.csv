Worst meal in 2 week stay/ miserable service apart from owners son who was the only good thing about this restaurant,"It was not fresh fish caught that day, tourist trap lie and then you get charged ‚Ç¨104 which was going to be ‚Ç¨114 Euro until we complained /for fish and chips and a tuna salad WE DIDNT EVEN ORDER WINE, we eat out every day and night on holiday and are experienced in good food and service that we are more than happy to pay for if all these are good, honestly guys unless you look like you have sailed in on a yacht you are treated like a lesser customer we witnessed this and it was very uncomfortable/ not a great experience bad waiter service miserable owners / not the Greek experience of really welcome and friendly / we are taking the friendly son out of this / he should run that business solo... they would do much better",Date of visit: September 2020,Palestra Restaurant,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Best meal we had Pefkos/ Lindos everything we had was 5 star,"So every food choice was lovely and much better than every other restaurant, we ate out everyday and every night, their breakfasts are also amazing and being an Interior Designer I can honestly say it is designed beautifully and tastefully right down to cutlery dinnerware choice absolutely 5 star , service was also spot on asking what you would like to drink before you order food is a must, something very simple that a lot of restaurants got wrong... we really loved it here make it one or more of your stop offs/ Gin and Tonics rocked also well done ENIGMA XXXXXX",Date of visit: September 2020,Enigma Restaurant,1,"Rhodes, Greece"

Beautiful grown up relaxed place to go / 3 Star surprise more like 4 STAR,"What a please pleasant surprise, we booked a budget holiday being Self catering 3 star as, by to be fair the quality of the complex in my opinion was that it seemed higher than a 3 Star, the complex is little walkways to each apartment hugging around the pool area in a very cosy traditional style, I personally loved it for this, we were located 1/2 tiers above bar which in high season and being busier would be really annoying, however the doors are double glazed and blocked out a lot of the sound, The kitchen is open so you can see how clean it is and again the food is on a budget but great quality and is clean and lovely, the staff were very lovely I didn‚Äôt feel like an annoying tourist I felt at home... very well run family business from what I can see, the location is also brilliant 5 mins walk to 3 lovely local beaches, the music was also to suit every taste, this is my first time in Rhodes/ Pefkos and I have built some beautiful lifetime memories with my youngest daughter and Mum, seriously if you read this review I am a critic and like all stuff done well, BOOK IT NOW I GUARANTEE YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED / minor minor feedback self catering kitchen in apartment lacked utensils and eqpt but staff were happy to lend simple things we needed I will be back again and again Thank youn FINAS",Date of stay: October 2019,Finas Hotel Apartments,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
