"Excellent location, agressive host","This place is very conveniently located 10 minutes walk from the historic centre of Lecce. It has atmospheric double rooms but the family suites are not recommended. The owner/manager/host treated us agressively and unpleasantly after we left, accusing us of having broken a door handle, which we hadn't. We had booked through Air B&B, who were very kind and professional and intervened to make sure we didn't receive any further bullying messages from him.",Date of stay: August 2018,Ada Suites,1,"Lecce, Italy"
"Excellent food, great service","We went to this lovely local taverna after a swim at Dafnoudi beach as it was recommended to us by Greek friends. It was a wonderful experience. Our waiter was efficient and smiley, delicious food arrived quickly. We had kebaps, which were excellent. Highly recommended.",Date of visit: August 2017,To Petrino,1,"Cephalonia, Greece"
A fantastic day out with a great captain!,"We had a day out with Dimitris in his fishermans' boat as a group of 7. We went around to lovely swimming spots in islands nearby Skiathos. He asked us if we like sea urchins and when he heard we did, he dove into the sea, picked up 20 or so, opened them up and prepared them for us on a lovely plate with olive oil and lemon juice. What a feast that was! Meanwhile hebplaywd fantastic jazz all day long. In the afternoon he treates us to a delicious fruit plate he prepared on the spot. Altogether the day was way beyond our expectations. Vira vira Dimitris!",Date of experience: July 2017,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,1,"Skiathos, Greece"
Sacrificing cleanliness and space for central location,"I was born at Nell Gwynn house, which is why I have an attachment there and wish to stay there whenever we are in London. However, I always leave it with such disappointment. The quality of the rooms varies extraordinarily. Those of us who live in countries where cleanliness is important and a 120 cm bed is unacceptable as a double bed will suffer here. Main adventage is location.",Date of stay: July 2017,Nell Gwynn House Apartments,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Great setting,"This hotel has a great setting in the historic seafront of Bergen, only a couple of minutes walk from the fishermen's market and the information centre. It has nice clean rooms, a good breakfast and helpful smiley staff. Highly recommended!",Date of stay: July 2016,Radisson Blu Royal Hotel Bergen,1,"Bergen, Norway"
"Lovely hotel, great views","This hotel has great smiley staff, and a lovely setting with fantastic views over the harbour. We stayed in the windmill itself, which was decorated charmingly. It is ideal for a family with older children (due to staircase). Hotel is approx. 7 minutes walk from the centre, and it is a nice walk along the sea. The breakfast menu is the only thing that is limited and could be improved. Altogether I can really recommend it.",Date of stay: July 2016,Porto Mykonos Hotel,1,"Mykonos, Greece"
An Afyon heritage,"Fantastic food, an Afyon landmark which deserves its reputation. The things to eat are their special veal dish and kaymakli ekmek kadayifi.",Date of visit: April 2016,Ikbal Lokantasi,1,"Afyonkarahisar, Turkey"
Sahte rakı,"Arkadaşlar çok dikkat edin! İki hafta önce bu müessesede 35'lik bir Yeni Rakı içtik - şahsen içerken de bir sert geldi, ben 1.5 duble kadar anca içtim. Şisesini kendi elimle açtım, yeni açılma sesini duydum. Buraya kadar birşey yok. Ama ertesi gün ben de arkadaşım da feci bir baş ağrısı, mide bulantısı ve genel fenalık hali yaşadık. 10 yıl önce de bir işletmede sahte rakı içtiğimde başıma bu sentomlar gelmis olduğu için bunu tanıyorum. Ancak 24 saat sonra toparlayabildik. Aman uzak durun...",Date of visit: October 2015,Safran Pub,1,"Istanbul, Turkey"
Overpriced poor quality accommodation in beautiful settings,"Getting here is really truly dangerous, you franchise your life to a total stranger who is on the phone most of the time while driving you right by a cliff. The running water is not pure, it is salty, so your hair remains damp all night and you need to use bottled water to even wash your face, let alone brushing your teeth. The rooms are not cleaned at all- so toilets start stinking in a couple of days. Decoration is cheap and tacky- a still life painting beside African masks, lots of Indian mirrored candleholders. Excellent food and beautiful nature, but considering these other aspects, it is beyond me how this place can get a Certificate of Excellence? We are used to camping as a family, had we done that we would have saved almost 100 Euros per night. Not recommended particularly to those who are used to the standards of similar establishments in the UK and Central Europe.",Date of stay: September 2015,Turan Hill Lounge,1,"Fethiye, Turkey"
"Lovely family hotel, excellent location","We travelled to Folegandros a a few weeks ago as a big group of Turks. We could not have been made more welcome at this lovely hotel. The family that runs it is very helpful, always greeting you with the broadest smiles. The location is perfect, a couple of minutes from the Chora. The rooms are spacious and remain cool during the day - they also have shutters so they can be darkened for sleep time. Folegandros is a boutique island, we discovered, so everything is a little bit pricy compared to some other islands (Milos, Naxos, etc), but this hotel was certainly worth it.",Date of stay: August 2015,Polikandia Hotel,1,"Folegandros, Greece"
"Good value, but lacking charm","Nice big and clean spacious rooms. A nice owner who is very helpful. We did have an encounter though with a cocroach and an AC that was spreading nasty humid smells. The curtains were light colour in our room, which I always find a nusiance when travelling with kids. The place lacks character and charm though, I think this is its main downside.",Date of stay: August 2015,Hotel Aeolis,1,"Milos, Greece"
Wonderful family Holiday venue,"Lovely big spacious rooms, a nice indoor/outdoor pool, good wellness section. Delicious food. Highly recommended for families with kids, although it is a 10 minute walk from the centre. The walk is very pleasant though.",Date of stay: January 2015,Hotel Edenlehen,1,"Mayrhofen, Austria"
Huge mismatch between the beauty of the setting of the hotel and service quality,"We have travelled to Cirali many times before but this was our first - and will be our last - stay at Olympos Lodge - the hotel with the best setting and therefore highest prices in Cirali. We were a group of 5 families with young children. We made a reservation in this hotel and paid a deposit 3 months in advance, to be told the day before our arrival that they had made a mistake and couldnt offer us one of our rooms - our only alternative was a room at the back, supposedly only let out to personal guests of the owners. We had very little maneouvring space at such short notice so unhappily we accepted their proposal - to find out that the room they were offering was outrageous. It was dark, at the back of the hotel, next to their laundry room so all sheets and towels were hung right in the front of the room. There was no baby monitor reception from that point which was a huge inconvenience. We were very disppointed, more so with the way they handled it all. Their attitude was outrageous. After almost 1 hour of negotiations at last they came to the point of offering the room for free. But this set the tone of our stay: The peacocks screeched all night long so children woke up anytime from 3.30am onwards. Cockerells would sit right outside your room and scream all night. Complaining several times didnt get them to take them away from guest bedrooms at night time - so we were sleepless and stressed out. We were told before our arrival that we didnt have to bring beach towels as they supplied them - but when we got there we found out there were never enough - to be told ""there are a more than enough towels if only people didn't take 3 at a time"" - well the smallest family there consisted of 3 people so what did they expect??? Breakfast starts at 8.10am earliest - this i very late when you think you are up from 5 am onwards...All in all there were a lot of shortcomings but the worst thing was the lack of professionalism in dealing with them. This hotel has the best location in Cirali but the worst service quality we have experienced to date. Such a shame...",Date of stay: May 2010,Olympos Lodge,1,"Cirali, Turkey"
