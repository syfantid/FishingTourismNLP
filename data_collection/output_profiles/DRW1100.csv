Bachelorette party fun with the driver TOM!!!,We had so much fun with Tom. He danced and sang and we had such a great time! He was part of our party and we loved it! Best two hours of my weekend! Thank you!!,Date of experience: August 2019,Detroit Rolling Pub,4,"Detroit, Michigan"
Awesome place to spend our wedding night!,"This hotel is excellent, The rooms were spacious and had a beautiful view. We checked in after our wedding late at night and they upgraded our room to a corner suite with a jucuzzi tub and it was amazing! we even had pizza delivered to the room in the middle of the night. 100% would recommend and I will stay here again at some point. Beautiful hotel!",Date of stay: June 2019,"Amway Grand Plaza, Curio Collection by Hilton",4,"Grand Rapids, Michigan"
So much fun!,Excellent excellent wines! 10 Euro for a tour and tasting was awesome. the exhibits are down a cave and it was a great experience and educational. I love wine so I was a fan. The tasting was great and had a good variety. the desert wines were to die for.,Date of experience: June 2019,Bronze Package,4,"Santorini, Greece"
My favorite part of our Santorini trip!,We did the sunset cruise and dinner and semi private tour. It was absolutely wonderful. So much fun! The captain was friendly and knowledgeable and her passion shows on this trip. We made friends with the four other people on the boat with us. The fish was amazing and cooked so well. It was so much fun seeing them pull the fish and shrimp and OCTOPUS!!! from the nets and traps. We even got to fish with poles and swim and snorkel in the cove. I would recommend this to everyone. I am so happy we booked this!!,,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Poor service and drinks,"This place is an awesome location and the pool is clean and nice views, but the terrible service and poor drinks do not make it worth it. The one waiter for the entire time we were there barely served us. We had to go up to ask for a menu and go up to ask to be served. My Long Island iced tea was watered down coke with a splash of rum. My husbands tequila and fruit smoothie had no alcohol in it. The waiter over was rude and ignored us. Not worth the money. Come to lay by the pool and get a soft drink for an hour if you need rest but don’t expect service or waste money on cocktails or food. Menu looks great but they don’t actually make anything on it.",Date of experience: June 2019,Lioyerma Lounge Cafe Pool Bar,4,"Santorini, Greece"
What an awesome experience!,My husband and I went on this small group yacht cruise. Swimming at Rhenia and the tour of Delos was so much fun. We got along well with the other patrons on the yacht and had a great time. Lunch and wine was served and we enjoyed it very much. A long trip and worth every penny. Delos was a treasure and the most wonderful place for history buff to visit. I would recommend this experience and company to everyone.,,Mykonos: Semi-Private Sailing Yacht Cruise to Rhenia and Guided Tour of Delos,4,"Mykonos, Greece"
Such a fun bar!,"Went with my husband on our honeymoon and got there early to watch the place fill up with people. Cool vibe and decor, strong drinks that were handcrafted and delicious. Our waiter and one of the managers we chatted with were the nicest people, so helpful and hospitable. I would recommend everyone in Greece go here for some fun conversations, cool drinks, and a fun experience.",Date of experience: June 2019,Lola Bar-Cafe,4,"Mykonos, Greece"
Breathtaking.,A must do for any couple or group of close friends! There is a 50€ per person minimum spend but the drinks are like 20 each so it’s not hard to meet that. Arrive about an hour before sunset and make a reservation online ahead of time. So 1000% worth it!!,Date of experience: June 2019,180 Degrees Sunset Bar,4,"Mykonos, Greece"
Delicious!!,Get the meat platter!! Amazing and authentic. Perfect location by The acropolis and less foot traffic than the other Main Street locations. So happy we are here!,Date of visit: June 2019,Dioskouri Cafe-Tavern,4,"Athens, Greece"
SO SLOW not worth it.,Service was incredibly slow even though the dining room was not even busy. It seemed like there was only one or two servers for the entire floor. We waiting over 20 mins for a draft beer and over an hour for 2 appetizers which didn’t even come out at the same time and we had to ask about them both twice. I don’t know what was going on with her servers or manager who didn’t seem to care. The atmosphere could be cool and fun and the food would be decent but the unreasonable terrible service ruined it. Won’t be back. Not worth it.,Date of visit: May 2018,Punch Bowl Social Detroit,4,"Detroit, Michigan"
Best Chinese buffet in town,Love coming here with friends. The price is good for the buffet. So many options and the quality is good considering it’s a buffet. Go early so it’s fresh. Will come back!,Date of visit: December 2017,Ming Ten,4,"Grand Rapids, Michigan"
Expected much much more,"Went in for a date night with my fiancé and was quoted a 30 minute wait but it took 45+minutes. It’s a Friday night so whatever but then then waitress never came to our table. A few minutes later we discover there was a button behind the dessert ad on the table to press to get a waiter. Our waitress finally comes and we ordered drinks and food right away and wait another 5-10mins wondering where or waters even are, haven’t been checked on again. We see that our waitress only has two other tables. Finally a manager (we think) comes around and asks us if we have been helped and gets us our drinks and checks to see if our food has been put in.

The food was mediocre. We both got different steaks. The only reason that they were somewhat remarkable was the sauce it was slathered in. The maple bacon sauce was great. The crispy kale side was also delicious. I ordered my steak medium rare. It was raw in the middle. Squishy and cold. Not rare. Un cooked, cold in the middle. I sent It back and it returned a few minutes later and it was clearly microwaved. I know because it was the same plate with the same cut pieces I had cut.

Overall we skipped dessert and I expected more for the prices. The ambience as a whole is confusing. Like they can’t figure out if they want to be an upscale grill or a sports bar or a college restaurant with offerings like their 38oz jungle juice style drinks they had on a Friday night special.

I later found out it’s owned by the same owners as Branns steakhouse so that probably explains the quality. I will more than likely not be returning. I’m glad I tried it but there are better places to spend the same amount of money on a nice meal.",Date of visit: December 2017,Kitchen 67,4,"Grand Rapids, Michigan"
Great and comfy hotel for business trip,The room was large and clean and comfortable. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was good. Fitness Center was a little small and cramped and lacking in equipment but it got the job done. Would stay again.,Date of stay: November 2017,Hampton Inn Champaign/Urbana,4,"Urbana, Illinois"
Dinner on a Friday,"The place is new so I give it credit, but the menu is basic and nothing unique or spectacular for the price. The food was good though, but nothing I wouldn't have found if the same quality elsewhere in GR. Drinks however were AWESOME. The Kentucky mule and the house Manhattan were great. Service is okay. This is the third time we have tried to come here and every time has had a line out the door or a long wait quote. This time they said 45 minutes and they didn't look busy and it was early for dinner. We sat at the bar and waited a while before a bartender said hello or took our order. Over all it is a nice place and the atmosphere and decor and drinks are great but wouldn't put it at the top of my list. Not sure if they are trying to be a fancy. Ugh this out or a middle of the road dinner place.",Date of visit: May 2017,Butcher's Union,4,"Grand Rapids, Michigan"
Lovely b&b and perfect location,"The building is beautiful, breakfast was amazing and the inn keeper Jane is friendly and helpful. We enjoyed a great anniversary weekend here and this was the perfect place to stay. The room was clean and comfortable. The location is right along the main strip of the town and I was very happy with our choice. We will be back!",Date of stay: April 2017,Saugatuck's Victorian Inn,4,"Saugatuck, Michigan"
Great renovation marred by stepping on glass in the room,"There we shards of glass and small, nearly invisible slivers of glass all over the hotel room floor that night. These pieces were found a few hours into my stay by myself and my friends who were staying there as we stepped on them. My boyfriend stepped on two pieces and one pricked his leg because it was in the bed he sat on. My other two friends stepped on pieces across the room by the other bed near the fridge and pulled pieces out of their feet. Upon inspecting further, we picked up multiple tiny shards between the bed, where I had one sliver pulled out of my finger. Looking underneath the bed, there were very large chunks of glass and more shards that were seemingly carelessly swept underneath the bed along with trash like cigarette wrappers. I photographed the shards and the mess underneath the bed and we gathered some pieces to take the front to desk to show them. At this point, we were understanding and the woman working the desk was apologetic. She explained she would remove the charges from our room and we accepted that resolution and returned to the room where we were more careful about walking on the concrete floor and carpets.

Other than this, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the place looked great and I would like to write this off as a fluke and try again, but I just cannot get past this.",Date of stay: September 2016,Trumbull and Porter Hotel - Downtown Detroit,4,"Detroit, Michigan"
Amazing!!,I eat here for breakfast every time I'm in Mackinaw and it never disappoints. The omlette was great and pancakes are delicious.,Date of visit: July 2016,Pancake Chef,4,"Mackinaw City, Michigan"
Decent Buffet for breakfast,The food was decent. A good heart breakfast but expensive for a mediocre buffet. Great service and great location though. Try to order from the menu in hopes of something better than the buffet with dried out food and limited options.,Date of visit: July 2016,Toast A Go Go,4,"Mackinaw City, Michigan"
Do no stay here! Not worth it.,"Myself and friends stayed here for five days for a convention. While the convention facilities were okay, this hotel service and facilities are not worth the price or fees they charge for everything! Parking cost me almost as much as a hotel room each night on top of the cost of the room, so if you come here DO NOT DRIVE. The service sucked over all. The wait staff is slow, doesn't pay attention or refill drinks, and didn't even bring some of the people at our tables their servings until we had to deliberately ask them for it. There is no mini fridge or anything in the rooms, so you have to buy everything in the hotel. And no microwaves anywhere for guest use. There is no hot tub in the pool area. We had to call multiple times for extra towels because they would not send them up unless we called and asked at least twice. And the maids just seems to skip our rooms someways. The Internet is not complementary. Really? In 2013 in such a 'nice' hotel they should at least provide basic wifi for free. We were at a professional conference and the most basic Internet was expensive and slow. None of the staff seemed to know what they were doing or were able to answer our questions. The keys to the rooms were weird and slow and it took us multiple tries to open our room doors every time. Thy could also use more signs to direct people because the layout is very confusing. The only good thing about this hotel is the location downtown so I could leave it!",Date of stay: August 2013,Philadelphia Marriott Downtown,4,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"
