Superb trip,We were extremely lucky to book on this trip. Definitely well worth it! Relaxed and enjoyable trip out. The fishing was enjoyable for all of us and our 2 girls really liked freeing the fish from the nets. Swimming off the back of the boat and smothering ourselves with clay were memorable. The highlights were the delicious food and our amiable hosts! Donâ€™t miss this it is definitely well worth it!,Date of experience: October 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
