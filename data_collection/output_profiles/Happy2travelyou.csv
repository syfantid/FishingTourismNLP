Special tasting experience and amazing cocktails!,During our stay in Santorini we were looking for a special tasting experience and we found the olive oil and honey tasting at STOA. This was a fantastic experience in a very cosy bar with the friendly and kind bar owner! The other days we tried also some of the cocktails and these were amazing! The best cocktails in our life! We highly recommend ! We will try for sure next time when in Santorini!,Date of visit: August 2020,Stoa Santorini,5,"Santorini, Greece"

Great catamaran cruises in Santorini,"For our 15th marriage anniversary we decided to have a private morning cruise in Santorini on a Brama catamaran and this was a perfect idea!

A must see in Santorini,"Wine Museum must be on your list of places to visit if you decide to spend some days in Santorini. It will be an unforgettable experience. We choose the Platinum package from the total of four: basic, silver, gold and platinum. Each of them includes the visit of the museum in the 8m deep caves underground, a really beautiful and special story told in 21 different languages, and a tasting experience of different wines. For the wine passionates and the wine collectors we recommend the Platinum package because you will taste 8 wines together with cold assorted apperitifs. Some of the wines were old ones, 15 years or more, maturated in oak barrels. One important reason why to make the wine tasting is because all wines produced by the Koutsoannopoulos family are produced 100% organically. This unique wine tasting experience is memorable because at the end we had the chance to taste 2 more unforgettable and rare wines from 1973 and 1988. This was a special und unexpected gift for our 15th marriage anniversary! The name of our guide for the wine tasting was Kostas from which we learned many information. So, if you have a special occasion in your life or not you really need to make a visit to the Wine museum plus a tasting of the vintage and unique wines! This recommendation is for all people, even for the ones that don't drink wine. Enjoy!",Date of experience: August 2020,Wine Museum Koutsogiannopoulos,5,"Santorini, Greece"
