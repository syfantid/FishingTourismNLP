Lovely Romantic Getaway!,"First ever all inclusive and the experience was absolutely lovely! We had booked our stay via voyage prive and the photos were identical to the holiday.
First night we arrived quite late (10pm) and we were advised to dine in vis a vis restaurant, this did put a downer on the start of our holiday as the food was not very good and the service wasn’t great either, warm wine and lack of enthusiasm to please. However, this was all turned around by checking into our ocean view suite, the great pool bar staff and the live trio band playing by the pool.
Thankfully as part of the suites we got to dine in the Alazonia restaurant for breakfast and dinner. Nikos (the captain) and his team were so delightful, customer service at its best and nothing was a trouble. This restaurant was a five course dinner every evening and the chefs served beautifully constructed plates of deliciousness!
Our experience was enlightened even more by dining at the milonges tavern, again service was outstanding and the a la carte food was amazing and plentiful. Both the daytime and nighttime pool bar teams were hardworking and extremely friendly.
Degu7, also part of the all inclusive, a 7 course fish taster menu in an ambient atmosphere with first class customer service.
We also tried the room service one evening which we believed came from the Alazonia restaurant once again the chefs delivered pallet pleasing plates.
Overall experience was relaxing and enjoyable.",Date of stay: May 2019,The Ixian Grand,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Amazing Fishing Trip,"This was a great day out which we would highly recommend to anyone even if it’s your first time fishing! The captain was very welcoming, friendly and helpful! The lunch served was delicious, whole fish bbq’d to perfection served with the classic tasty Greek salad all made fresh onboard.
Overall experience was AMAZING!",Date of experience: May 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
