Outstanding!!!,"This was absolutely the highlight of our trip to kefalonia. Demetrios and Efi were very personable, friendly, and accommodating hosts and you felt as if they were long time friends. They put nets out the night before and as we sat on the boat we watched as they reeled in the fish that would soon be our meal on board! They were super knowledgeable about every fish they reeled in and took the time to explain every detail. They took us to remote places to swim (only reachable by boat) and we took full advantage of jumping off the boat while inhaling the delicious scents of freshly food cooking for us. This was a one of a kind experience that cannot be missed!! The home made wine, freshly cut salad were an added delight! I can personally say that my family and I will never forget this amazing experience and we will definitely be back next year!!!!!!",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Disappointing,"With so many choices in skala this one does not deliver. Ordered the calamari and there were few on the plate. The tzatziki had no flavor and was awful. The pita bread was an odd consistency and not good at all. There were 6 of us, and we were all disappointed.",Date of visit: August 2019,Sunrise Fish Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Amazing!,Everything super fresh and delicious. Definitely make a reservation because it gets very busy. Every dish that the six of us are was amazing. Probably our favorite restaurant so far In Bellagio.,Date of visit: August 2019,La Fontana Bellagio,4,"Bellagio, Italy"
Wow!,"The food was incredible! Large portions, amazing selections and unique menu. A must for seafood lovers. Definitely one of my favorite places..",Date of visit: April 2018,Waterzooi Belgian Bistro,4,"Garden City, New York"
Not impressed,"We had a beautiful view overlooking Central Park and the ambiance was a bit loud but very nice. Dinner was ok.., the steak looked good , i had the swordfish which was dried out and tough. The crab cake appetizer was seared almost too well, but the other appetizers were small in proportion but good. The waiter was almost non existent through out the night so we were waving a different server down through out the night for a drink. With so many pricey steak houses in nyc, you can definitely find better than this one.",Date of visit: December 2017,Porter House,4,"New York City, New York"
Perfect dinner,"Being that there are thousands of restaurants to choose from in NYC this was not my first choice for an anniversary dinner but I’m so glad we decided to pick this one. Glamorous and white glove it is not. But if you are looking for great food, fun atmosphere and warm inviting ambiance this place is for you. Tom will greet you, and get your story, and the waiters, the hostess, and the bartender are just as personable. The place has many famous people who have dined there- we even sat at the table that they filmed an episode of sex in the city in. But, besides all of the above, more importantly it’s the food that will draw you in. I️ had the lobster ravioli (sooo good) and my husband had the pasta in rigatoni sauce. Both excellent. Tom even sent over a dessert, a chocolate mouse cake that was amazing .. a nice touch for our anniversary. You won’t be disappointed -we can’t wait to come back!",Date of visit: November 2017,Da Marino Restaurant,4,"New York City, New York"
Just ok,We decided to stop in this place before a show. The food was decent at best. My husband had a pizza and said he had better frozen pizza from a box. The place is cute and cozy with warm ambiance and the staff is super nice. Would recommend just going for a drink.,Date of visit: November 2017,Cielo at the Mayfair,4,"New York City, New York"
Perfect stay,"Clean and comfortable we were very happy with our stay. Perfectly located, this hotel is modern and has an excellent staff. Everyone very attentive . Check out the rooftop bar! A nice added touch .. they knew it was our anniversary and sent up a bottle of wine with two glasses with a hand written note. Definitely would return.",Date of stay: November 2017,The Knickerbocker Hotel,4,"New York City, New York"
UNBELIEVABLE! BEST SERVICE EVER!!!!!,"I just had to write a review for this outstanding hotel. I have been around the world to many hotels, and there has not been one hotel that has equalled the outstanding service of this hotel. Everyone from the bell boy, to the maid and everyone in between, are top notch. They all have gone out of their way, above and beyond to make your trip a memorable one. We stayed in the suites which were beautifully maintained, and the location of the hotel was incredible, but that aside... I cannot say enough about the service. I wish I took down names but there were too many to write down since all were top notch but a special shout out to Danielle & Andy at the concierge and Ashley Sun who helped me book this fine hotel. Again, do NOT go anywhere else. It will not compare o this amazing hotel. By the way, did I mention super clean rooms and most comfortable bed ever????????",Date of stay: July 2017,Fairmont Miramar Hotel & Bungalows,4,"Santa Monica, California"
Dated and musty,stayed here for an overnight to go to the airport. Was not happy. Service was great by rooms were poor. Did not feel clean and rooms were dated. I would not stay again when there are local hotels that are better quality.,Date of stay: July 2017,Homewood Suites by Hilton San Diego Airport - Liberty Station,4,"San Diego, California"
Eclectic and tasty!,"The dinner was delicious! We had such a variety of different food I can't even begin to tell you what we had! There were six of us and the waiter (impressively knowledgeable) guided us to how much to order, and what to get. This is certainly not to be missed if you are looking for a creative and delicious dining experience.",Date of visit: July 2017,Tar & Roses,4,"Santa Monica, California"
Good Italian food & great vibe,Dinner was very good. Fresh and tasty with a decent selection of entrees. Portions were on a smaller scale so definitely worth ordering an appetizer. The restaurant is located in a house and has a cool vibe. We happen to be upstairs and the noise level was a bit crazy since it was busy so if your looking for a romantic dinner you would need to be seated outside or possibly downstairs with fewer tables. Would definitely go again!,Date of visit: July 2017,Barrique Venice,4,"Los Angeles, California"
Excellent dinner,The food was excellent! Everything was super fresh and tasty. Our waiter Michael was outstanding . The only negative feedback I could give is that the bus boys cleaned up way too fast not letting you take your time. Being this place is so busy I understand why but did this did not make it a relaxing dinner.,Date of visit: July 2017,The Lobster,4,"Santa Monica, California"
Awesome,A great way to the see the city and its sites. Rob our tour guy was very personable and knowledgeable! A must do when in Charleston!,Date of experience: April 2017,Bulldog Tours,4,"Charleston, South Carolina"
Exceptional,If you like fish this is the place to go. Excellent and creative choices in a hip old converted bank. One of our favorites in Charleston!,Date of visit: April 2017,The Ordinary,4,"Charleston, South Carolina"
Out of this world,"This place was amazing!! I was very concerned about the 40 minute wait and wasn't sure it was a good idea but I was so wrong. The best fish ever!! I had the lobster roll and my husband had the shrimp po boy.. we split each and they were awesome! Started with the guacamole and chips which were super fresh. The bread that the sandwiches were on were delicious. Top notch place, hoping they will expand next time we visit!",Date of visit: April 2017,167 Raw,4,"Charleston, South Carolina"
Excellent breakfast,Everything was so tasty! Best part was the biscuit and gravy - a must try!! Staff was attentive and personable. Worth the wait!,Date of visit: April 2017,Toast Restaurant,4,"Charleston, South Carolina"
Hysterical!,You MUST go to a show! Totally interactive and so much fun. The actors/actresses are so funny and it's small enough of an audience that you feel like everyone is involved and you are all friends. Definitely worth going! Not to miss!,Date of experience: April 2017,The Black Fedora Comedy Mystery Theatre,4,"Charleston, South Carolina"
Expected more,"Although the food is very good, I expected more. The food was very good that is true but definitely not the best I have ever had. First off, the portions were small for the price. The staff is excellent, well trained. The ambiance is pretty. There are so many places in Charleston that are amazing that I definitely feel this place wasn't one of them. I have the rating a four star because the food was very good, but that being said It's not a necessary trip back.",Date of visit: April 2017,Charleston Grill,4,"Charleston, South Carolina"
You won't be disappointed!,"Went to dinner last night and I had to write a review this morning. From the service, to the drinks, to the food - all amazing. Having been spoiled going to NYC steak houses, this is definitely on the same level but with a warmer, mom and pop feel. So good made a reservation to go back tonight!",Date of visit: April 2017,Halls Chophouse,4,"Charleston, South Carolina"
Good food!,"Food was good. Real flavorful barbecue food. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the service was very slow. Went in for lunch, the place was not insanely busy and could not understand the slow service. Other than that, good food.",Date of visit: April 2017,Poogan's Smokehouse,4,"Charleston, South Carolina"
Good seafood,"The seafood is good. I wouldn't say outstanding , I definitely had better but you won't be unhappy with your meal. It's an extremely busy place and the service is excellent. The place is very noisy but you definitely will be glad you stopped in.",Date of visit: April 2017,Hank's Seafood Restaurant,4,"Charleston, South Carolina"
"Beautiful restaraunt, food just ok","Went for lunch today. It was at best ""ok"". The atmosphere is amazing . An old church converted into a hip restaraunt. If the food was exceptional, the place would be really busy. I had a chicken salad which was more of a snack. Very small portion. My husband had the burger which he said was good. Not a big lunch menu so not slot to chose from. More of an experience then a dining choice. Probably cool place to go for drinks at best.",Date of visit: April 2017,5Church Charleston,4,"Charleston, South Carolina"
Excellent !,Came here for breakfast and thought it was top notch. Creative menu and very delicious. Had the short stack of pancakes just to try and they were amazing. Had the Greek yogurt with home made granola and praline - best I ever had. My husband had the eggs everything very fresh. Definitely recommend!,Date of visit: April 2017,Eli's Table,4,"Charleston, South Carolina"
Perfect in every way,"I visited this hotel because I was moving my son into his off campus apartment in Tuscaloosa. I was pleasantly surprised that this hotel was clean, updated, and so accommodating. The location was ideal as well. I loved that the rooms were modern and the beds were so comfortable. Would definitely stay again.",Date of stay: August 2016,SpringHill Suites by Marriott Tuscaloosa,4,"Tuscaloosa, Alabama"
A perfect location...,"I have been coming to Greenport for almost 50 years so I have seen the transformation in this hotel. We recently stayed here and took three rooms for all of my family to be together. The location is beyond magnificent . You can't get better than this so if you are looking to literally be right on the beach, no question, you need to stay here. The staff is exceptional. They are working really hard to make your stay a great one. A special shout out to Teach who is the general manager. He was attentive, personable and well informed. The hotel is in the process of being re-done which is beyond necessary. I am sure it will be magnificent when it is completed. You can start to see already small changes- new pillows, sun beds, sheets, towels a snack bar. The office is great too. Now the bad part... The rooms are very worn. I don't care about worn but definitely not as clean as they should be. The rug was stained, there was food left behind in all three of our rooms, the kitchen appliances in our rooms were dirty. The sliding glass doors needed a good windex in order to appreciate the gorgeous view. Small things but big difference if they were done. I could deal with horrible broken bathroom tile but cleanliness is important especially when you are paying close to $350 per night. I don't want this to deter you staying at this hotel. But, you should know what you are getting. If you want to go before the remodeling takes place, then you should wait until you get the room at a good discount (maybe groupon?) if not you should wait until the remodeling is completed to stay. I am sure between the excellent staff and the location of the hotel, it will be magnificent and definitely the place to stay. Right now, it needs work.",Date of stay: August 2016,Sound View Greenport,4,"Greenport, New York"
Good but certainly not the best,"Went to this restaurant with my family of seven. They were very accommodating getting us in at the last minute. The food was good but very hard to be a true critic since it does not compare to USA steakhouses. I will say they were extremely knowledgeable about their wine with an extensive selection. The service was also top notch. Don't get me wrong the food was very good , but not superb.",Date of visit: July 2016,George Prime Steak,4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
Amazing !,This was by far our favorite place to eat. The food was amazing and the service was excellent. The beef goulash was hands down the best we have ever had and the rabbit was delicious. All six of us ordered different meals and there was not a disappointed member of our family. You must go!,Date of visit: July 2016,U Kroka,4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
"Excellent staff, breakfast is amazing!!",The staff is excellent very attentive and very large American style portions for breakfast. Lunch and dinner were equally amazing. John the owner keeps a close eye and makes sure everything is done right and it is! A must go!!!,Date of visit: July 2016,Avra,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Always a good meal,The food here is always good and portions are a nice size. The grilled octopus is very good and the view is breathtaking. You can't go wrong eating here!,Date of visit: July 2016,Old Times,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Best restaurant in Skala,Year after year we come back and visit Skala and this is our favorite go to place . The food is always amazing and fresh. The service is always top notch with the waiters being extremely friendly and knowledgeable. You can't get better than this!,Date of visit: July 2016,The Old Village,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Excellent stay,The hotel was situated high with beautiful scenic views. The rooms were clean and the staff was very attentive . The beach was beautiful with many sun beds . The pool was gorgeous. The only thing I would suggest would be to have air in the elevator . Small detail but it was boiling in there after spending a hot day in the beach. A special shout out to yianni who maintains the property who was always eager to help!,Date of stay: July 2016,Regina Dell Acqua Resort,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Excellent,"Our hotel recommended this restaurant and we were so happy they did! With London having so many great places to eat this was truly a gem. Between the service, the drinks and the food it was truly excellent . A bit pricy but worth it.",Date of visit: July 2016,Gaucho Piccadilly,4,"London, United Kingdom"
"It's about the experience, not the food","Everyone should eat dinner at the eifel tower especially at night when the city is lit and the view is amazing. That's exactly what you are paying for. It's good, not great and very expensive for what you are getting but the view and experience is priceless.",Date of visit: July 2016,58 Tour Eiffel Restaurant,4,"Paris, France"
Perfect !,The apartments were perfectly situated walking distance to all the sites. The rooms were spacious and the beds extremely comfortable . We were a family of six and had plenty of room. The staff was helpful and accommodating. Would definitely stay again .,Date of stay: July 2016,Residence Brehova - Prague City Apartments,4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
Excellent breakfast,Trendy cafe with an excellent breakfast . Were seated immediately with a party of six. Staff was attentive and quick with serving. Omelette was amazing! Would definitely visit again !,Date of visit: July 2016,Home Kitchen,4,"Prague, Czech Republic"
Excellent,We stopped in on the way to the airport (only a five minute drive from the restaurant) the food was excellent and the staff was timely since they knew we had to make it to the airport. Definitely a good stop !,Date of visit: July 2016,Dum Spiros Spero Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
A top notch hotel!!!,"Over the years I have stayed at numerous hotels and this one is exceptional!!! The customer service is incredible ! This hotel does it right... Champagne on arrival, walking the guests to their room, and everything in the room complimentary! No need to count what you use in the mini bar! The rooms are impeccable with very comfortable bedding, breakfast is top notch and free of charge and the location is perfect. .. Close to everything. Again I go back to the staff, a special shout out to Charlotte who worked at the front reception yet we bumped into her everywhere we went because she was basically anywhere in the hotel that needed assistance. The employees need to be complimented because it is truly what makes this hotel extra special. Don't stay anywhere else , nothing will compare .",Date of stay: July 2016,Amba Hotel Charing Cross,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Quaint & Quiet,Beautiful boutique hotel with luxury accommodations. Close to sites and staff very pleasant. Would definitely return! We had two rooms and both were comfortable and clean. Over sized for Paris standards. The staff was very helpful with cab and dinner reservations as well.,Date of stay: July 2016,Victoria Palace,4,"Paris, France"
Average stay..,"This was an average stay with convenience to the convention center and mall. The rooms were nothing spectacular but clean. The lobby and hallways were FREEZING, definitely no heat, (and yes, outside there were low temperatures) BUT with that said, the hotel should have been warmer.The rates were pricey for what you are getting but we paid for the convenience.",Date of stay: February 2015,Omni Providence Hotel,4,"Providence, Rhode Island"
Pricey for quality...,"It was just ok. I was expecting high end quality of food and drink and did not get that. I was expecting pricey and I did receive that! The seafood tower was frozen, our waiter was emotionless, and the food portions were tiny!",Date of visit: February 2015,Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar,4,"Providence, Rhode Island"
Amazing....,"I haven't been here in 30 years and re-visited two weeks ago. It was fantastic. Sushi was great, the lamb chops were perfect and the steak hands down cooked to perfection. The waiter was very knowledgeable and made for a great evening with his suggestions. We were seated upstairs after making a last minute reservation but was fine.",Date of visit: January 2015,The River Palm Terrace,4,"Edgewater, New Jersey"
Always an excellent stay...,"This hotel is just beautiful. During Christmas time it is a winter wonderland complete with a 1,000 things to do with the little ones and a nice cozy fireplace to settle in and have drinks for the adults. Dinner at the Blue Pig is always good and the pub is always crowded but expected this time of year. The hotel is historic so very old, but in general well kept.",Date of stay: December 2014,Congress Hall,4,"Cape May, New Jersey"
A nice surprise...,"The hotel was an excellent surprise. Nice, comfortable rooms. Very clean and service was great. Everyone was friendly and hospitable. I would definitely stay again. Not luxurious by no means, but close to airport and access too everything.",Date of stay: November 2014,Hilton Los Angeles Airport,4,"Los Angeles, California"
A hidden gem...,"This is a great place for lunch or dinner. By no means fancy, and definitely can be cramped at times, but the food is always great. I do suggest the give the place a face lift, it definitely needs a paint job, new floor etc., but the food is what makes us all come back for more. The soups are GREAT, give it a try you won't be sorry!",Date of visit: November 2014,Jack's Cafe,4,"Westwood, New Jersey"
You will not eat a better panini in Italy!,"My niece spent four months in Italy studying abroad, so when we went to Florence she insisted we try this place. We went for lunch and had THE BEST PANINI's EVER! The food was amazingly fresh, the owners were super attentive and the food was better than ever! We stopped in for a quick lunch and hands down it was better than some dinners we had! You won't be disappointed...they are also VERY reasonably priced.",Date of visit: June 2014,Salumeria Verdi - Pino's Sandwiches,4,"Florence, Italy"
Best crepes in Florence!,Definitely worth stopping in if you love crepes. My kids ate there every morning. Crepes area great and the place is very nicely done.,Date of visit: June 2014,La Milkeria,4,"Florence, Italy"
A true gem in Rome...,"This restaurant was referred to us by a local and we were very nervous at first. We had reservations (make sure you make them it gets busy!) and the six of us walked into what seemed a very little place. We were directed to a downstairs and to my surprise the place is much bigger than expected. Our waitress was excellent, knowledgable about every dish and definitely steering us to correct choices. Then again, there are no bad choices since all of our dishes were AMAZING. Do not miss this restaurant!",Date of visit: June 2014,Osteria Barberini,4,"Rome, Italy"
A beautiful lunch with wine tasting...,"Our limo driver was nice enough to bring us to a family owned winery. Upon calling, the owner wiped us up lunch fresh from her garden with the BEST lasagna I have ever tasted. We did not stay at the resort, simply came to taste the wines and have a great lunch. We spent a fortune shipping wine home after (delicious!) and it was well worth the visit. The owner gave us a private tour, along with a magnificent lunch all with a half hour heads-up that we were coming. Yes, a little pricy but you're in Italy you have to do it!",Date of stay: July 2014,Fattoria Sant'Appiano,4,"Barberino Val d'Elsa, Italy"
Average and a bit over priced...,"The restaurant staff was very nice, and although very busy, they did make their way to the table as much as possible . The food was good but not over the top. There are restaurants in Florence that are not as expensive and the food is impressive. That being said, there were six of us, and I told the waiter it was my daughters birthday and they brought out an entire cake for us, and charged us 45 euro for it. I would have liked to know PRIOR to getting the cake that this was the price. We were expecting only a slither for my daughter but they brought out the entire cake. Chalk it up to a language barrier (yet they all speak English) but I was not happy about it. They were too busy to discuss it, and again I am not blaming them entirely. They were VERY nice people, even offering us their umbrellas to take home after dinner since there was a down pour.",Date of visit: July 2014,L'Osteria di Giovanni,4,"Florence, Italy"
Home cooking the way it should be!,"This little restaurant was by far my favorite restaurant in Italy. The food was SO good and the owner so attentive. This is a restaurant that should not be missed. Over a ten day span in Italy, this restaurant speaks for itself. Not sure if it was over priced since we were a party of six, but I do know we all left very happy.",Date of visit: July 2014,Pietro Valentini Ristorante,4,"Rome, Italy"
Excellent!,"Food was very good and the service was excellent. We found this place to be a bit pricy, but worth the price.",Date of visit: July 2014,Ristorante Buca Mario,4,"Florence, Italy"
Excellent!,"If you want to see other areas of Kefalonia this is the way to go! It's a great excursion and you will be more than satisfied! The staff is EXCELLENT, and you are invited to jump off the ship which makes a great time for adults and kids. Don't miss it! We took all three destinations, the one to Zakenthos, Ithaki and Fiscardo. All were excellent voyages and we would absolutely do all three again!",Date of experience: July 2014,Captain Vangeli's Special Cruises,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Make sure you stop in!,"Everything was perfect including the blueberry steak, homemade pasta and delicious appetizers. It's a small place with many visitors so you might have to wait but WORTH IT!",Date of visit: June 2014,Acquapazza Firenze,4,"Florence, Italy"
Can't say enough ....,"I cannot say enough about this hotel. Amazing in every aspect. The service was incredible. The place is beautiful. You must see the indoor pool even if you do not intend on swimming. It is nothing I have ever seen before!!!! We have a family of six and for 50 euros a night more, they upgraded us to the presidential suite - well worth the money. It was beautiful. The breakfast was a true American breakfast, lunch by the pool was great as well. If I ever visit Rome again, this is the only hotel I would stay at. It is a bit away from the attractions so we had to use cab services, but a very tiny price to pay fpr this luxurious hotel.",Date of stay: July 2014,Parco dei Principi Grand Hotel & SPA,4,"Rome, Italy"
Very helpful staff...,The staff was very helpful and attentive. The hotel was average. WE had a family of six so we had two rooms. One room was in the new section of the hotel which was clean and new but not special at all. The second room was clean but with a basement feel so not particularly nice. We stayed only one night so it was adequate for the amount of time we were staying but I would not have stayed there longer than that. It is the BEST hotel if you are taking the metro since it is conveniently close and you are in for a short amount of time.,Date of stay: July 2014,Athens Lotus Hotel,4,"Athens, Greece"
Best place to stay in Skala...,"We just came back from Skala last week and we can't say enough about this hotel. Effie & George are wonderful people who are hard working and care about their establishment and their guests. This was our second stay at their hotel and surely will not be our last. The rooms are spacious and updated. The entire place is spotless down to the walking paths around the hotel. The staff is wonderful - love the girls at the front desk (so sorry how could I forget her name??) Claire and Hercules are not only employees but friends to all of the guests, and even the cleaning staff will stop and chat. The location could not be better, smack in front of the beach surrounded by great restaurants, and the place is heavenly. You won't be disappointed.",Date of stay: July 2014,Anassa Hotel,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
The best!,"Definitely a restaurant you must not miss in Skala! The family is one of the nicest families I have ever met, trying their hardest to please all of their customers. Their food is fresh and delicious. We ate their many nights and diode not have one bad meal. We will definitely be back!",Date of visit: July 2014,Mikelatos,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Nice but there are better hotels...,"I can't say the hotel was terrible but standard at it's best. We had two rooms since we are a family of six and the rooms were clean and decent. The walls are paper thin and you could hear everyone in their rooms so if this bothers you, not the hotel for you. The hotel is clean and the staff is attentive.",Date of stay: June 2014,Hotel Kette,4,"Venice, Italy"
Not to be missed,The whole reason to go to Venice in the first place!!! Don't miss it!! It is very hard to avoid anyway,Date of experience: June 2014,Canal Grande,4,"Venice, Italy"
