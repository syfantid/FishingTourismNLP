A great insight into the fishing life of Kefalonia combined with amazing food and great swimming and relaxation too!,"Thank you for Michalis and Antonia for looking after us all so beautifully yesterday. As a family of six adults we were greeted on the dock with home made cake and coffee before we set off and then experienced in a very small way the life of the fishing boat. 2km of nets pulled in, hard work, brutal at times, explained in Antonia’s excellent English.

The fabulous appetiser and lunch interspersed time swimming in the azure seas and diving off the boat. By the time we set off back for the port we were all happily full, relaxed and tired.

What a lovely day out!",Date of experience: October 2020,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Our go to weekend family lunch,"Love love love Naturally Chinese for dim sum at the weekend.

It’s simply the best!!

We have been coming to this restaurant for the past five years or more and it reliably delivers good service, excellent dim sum and always something interesting depending on the season.

We are lucky to have this restaurant in Surbiton!",Date of visit: September 2018,Naturally Chinese Restaurant,4,"Surbiton, United Kingdom"
"A great, hearty, authentic meal in a lovely environment with kind and genuine service.","On a day off my husband and I stumbled across this restaurant and lived the interior and cleanliness of the toilets as much as our super cheap and hearty lunch outside in the September sun.

The following weekend we took the extended family and we’re not disappointed by a wide ranging authentic menu, comfy seating and traditional want Bulgarian welcome.

Our Sunday lunch was quiet and tasty, but Saturday night is apparently more noisy with live music!

Great find!",Date of visit: September 2018,Bulgarian House Restaurant,4,"Surbiton, United Kingdom"

"Nightclub lobby and check-in, basic room, but comfortable and welcoming","Shocking to arrive Saturday night at a hotel and be greeted by neon lights, queuing clubbers and iPad check-in but this hotel was a comfy basic choice. Bed was clean and comfortably, view from the roof in the day wonderful and everything worked.",Date of stay: February 2018,Public,4,"New York City, New York"

"Excellent team, comfortable hotel, great food!","We spent an excellent week skiing as a group of six adults and seven children in this chalet hotel. Vicky the manager and Joe in the kitchen greeted us on arrival with a hearty meal which made us realise our holiday started there. The week was perfectly catered for by the whole team including the amazing Louis, Edd, Sam and Jamie and a quiet but obviously just as brilliant commis chef!

Breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner were all really nicely presented, tasty and generous.

Every one of our needs was carefully and conscientiously met.

We stayed in rooms 11 and 12 and although they cost a little more this gave us a little more space which was very welcome.

The hotel is close to the free shuttle bus that whips people up to the ski lifts although there is skiing from the end of the road.

For a reasonably priced comfortable hotel, easily accessible and with a perfectly friendly and welcoming staff, we could not have done better for our week in Tignes.

Well done to them all! And thank you.",Date of stay: January 2015,Hotel Le Dome,4,"Tignes, France"
A dreadful disappointment.,"When I booked the room for a one night stay I already felt the personal contact was not of a polished or friendly standard, on arrival I was shocked that we were expected to pay extra for parking or park in a local NCP( and no one had thought to ask or check when I booked?). Similarly I was surprised that there would be an extra charge for an English breakfast! Full payment for the room plus a £50 deposit was taken immediately on my card was taken too - unusual and not reassuring or welcoming.

The room, which was a suite - our booking-in receptionist said her favourite room - was not a suite but a semi circular long but not unpleasant room. It was desperately badly lit which sounds like a small thing but is really not useful when trying to get ready for a party. The only full length mirror was also not very big or very accessible and the low lighting made everything difficult to find.

These things were made better by an attentive barman in the evening and a very comfortable bed. The nespresso coffee machine and big bath with lovely products were also very welcome and more in line with what we had expected.

Unfortunately at breakfast everything went pear-shaped. A seriously understaffed breakfast room resulted in queuing and cross diners and stressed staff, all of which had considerable impact on us even though we were seated.

When we went to complain to the manager we found him to be trying to support his staff at the expense of giving attention to his guests. He apologized, reduced the price of our room but was not in a position to rectify the fundamental problem which seems to be beyond anyone working on the hotel floor.

We saw some incredibly committed and hard working staff ( well one particularly at breakfast) but the overriding impression was of people operating at their own speed with more interest in themselves than the comfort of their guests or ensuring the excellence of service.

Overall, our night at the Malmaison Oxford was a dreadful disappointment.",Date of stay: November 2014,Malmaison Oxford Castle,4,"Oxford, United Kingdom"
