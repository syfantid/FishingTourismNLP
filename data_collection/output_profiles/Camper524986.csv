The best fishing trip ever!,"What an incredible experiance this fishing trip was! 5 hour fishing trip with view on the Rhodes old town from the sea, great opportunity to teach the little ones how to fish and fishing for Tuna trolling! Truly unforgettable experience. Fresh fish for dinner, great salad and amazing toasted bread! Got a good footage with out underwater camera while swimming so really pleased with that. Capitan was even kind enough to let our son hold steering wheel for good 40 mins. Well deserved 5 stars! We will definitely be back there shortly!",Date of experience: October 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
