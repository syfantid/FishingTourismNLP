Great Restaurant,"Visited on a Saturday for dinner and dined in the outdoor area. Temperature taken before we were seated and masks are required to visit the restroom. Hand sanitizer available and use encouraged.
The food was awesome. Hummus, fava, taramasalata and tzaziki were excellent and the bread delicious. Squid was great. Mains of chicken, cod-cheeks and wings were amazing but a special shout-out to the cauliflower which was to die for! The servers were attentive and we all felt Covid-safe. A memorable night!",Date of visit: August 2020,Arabica King's Cross,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Great Experience,"Went on the river cruise first, no queues and well-spaced seating. Our host, Jack was great, very informative and clearly missing his calling as a comedian! All the staff were super-friendly and welcoming. Masks are required and your temperature taken before you board.
Next to the London Eye. Again, everyone super-friendly and accommodating. No queues and pod numbers limited in line with social distancing (there were five people in our pod in total). Masks are required and temperature checked. The views were magnificent.
All in all a fun couple of hours and we felt Covid-safe throughout.",,London Eye River Cruise and Standard London Eye Ticket,4,"London, United Kingdom"
Fabulous!,Had the moussaka - it was delicious. The staff are really friendly and professional. Will be returning!,Date of visit: August 2019,Alpha 23,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic Holiday,"Stayed here late July for 11 nights. Christina, Paul and Katy are brilliant hosts - kind and chilled. Scenery fantastic, beaches beautiful. Apartments clean and tidy with a nice pool area and Lassi and Argostoli within easy walking distance. Will definitely return!",Date of stay: July 2018,Metaxatos Apartments,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Brilliant Birthday!,"Hired a boat with Skipper Mike for my birthday. Had a fantastic time. Picked up from our apartment and taken to the port in Argostoli. The Gulf is like a pond in the morning - absolutely serene. Morning spent visiting the mountain goats, speeding past the fish farms, swimming in the glorious water, finally arriving at Lixouri for lunch. Great meal and then off to Rabbit Island, water a bit choppy but huge fun. The Ionian Sea is one of my favourites; clear, turquoise water and ideal swimming conditions. Next, to White Rocks where Mike showed off his nautical skills and took us through a narrow cave before reaching the beach - again stunning. Finally back to Argostoli after a stop at Lassi beach and then a tour of the port to see the turtles and Europe’s oldest port bridge, meeting Mike’s grandson on the way! A perfect way to spend the day. Thank you Mike for some great memories.",Date of experience: July 2018,Kefalonia Boat Hire,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Fantastic Place!,Stopped for a quick drink after a boat tour. The owners are absolutely fantastic - warm and hospitable. Location is wonderful. Would definitely recommend - thank you Mike!,Date of visit: July 2018,Captain's Table Cafe Restaurant,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great grilled cheese!,Seating area exposed to outdoors so a little chilly but the food was gorgeous (although 1 * withheld for the slaw.) The £5 shake was definitely worth it and the New Yorker to die for. Uber Eats * 4 visits in the 30 mins I was there. Would recommend.,Date of visit: October 2017,Northern Soul Grilled Cheese,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Brilliant!,"Effi, Dimitrious and Mohammed really make this trip - thank you to you all for a fabulous day out! The day starts with donuts and coffee for breakfast followed by bringing in nets that contain your lunch. My 12 year old enjoyed untangling the fish from the nets and Efi was full of local knowledge. A couple of sublime beaches later complete with a full body clay treatment we were ready for lunch. And what a lunch! Fresh fish, an always solid Greek salad and then; Effie's Potato Salad - to die for! Great company from the Netherlands and Italy - a really special day. Again thanks to Efi, Dimitrious and Mohammed, so welcoming and instructive. Would definitely do again.",Date of experience: August 2017,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Tasty!,"Visited tonight with my extremely fussy 9 year old daughter and my not so fussy sister. Ordered the skirt for my daughter as it states no fat. I had the T-bone and my sister the entrecôte. All the steaks were cooked perfectly - rare, as ordered. The 5* is for the quality of the steaks; juicy, tasty and delicious! If you're a meat lover and want a fantastic steak that stands on it's own without the usual sauces give Hector's a try. It's well worth it!",Date of visit: October 2015,Argentinian Steak House LA PARRILLA DE HÉCTOR,4,"Benidorm, Spain"
Brilliant!,Found Amigos by accident and so glad we did. The restaurant was full the first night we walked past so we booked the next day for that evening as there were eleven of us. We were told at the time of booking that because of the group size it would be tapas only - not a problem! We ate outside and as it was a little chilly blankets were provided as well as an outdoor heater - nice touch. We went with the owner's recommendations for the food and every dish was excellent. The tapas came at intervals so the meal was nicely paced and the decor was lovely. At £20 a head (including copious amounts of wine!) it was great value for money and definitely worth a visit.,Date of visit: February 2014,Amigos Restaurant and Roof Terrace,4,"Benidorm, Spain"
"Lovely staff, excellent food.",We go to Sottovento every month or so. I always order the steak - it's a beautiful cut and the chef really knows how to cook it rare. The service is excellent and the staff are really friendly. My niece (age 7) thinks the pizza is 'really yummy'! Well worth a visit.,,Sottovento,4,"Bolton, United Kingdom"
