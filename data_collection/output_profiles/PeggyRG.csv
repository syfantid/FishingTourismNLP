Fabulous for lunch or dinner!,"If you're looking for great Italian food with great service and very welcoming atmosphere, this is the place. It's been run by the same family since 1944. Pasquale (Patsy) and his lovely wife Concetta could not have been any more welcoming and we were introduced to their son, Sal, who runs the kitchen as Head Chef. I highly recommend it!",Date of visit: October 2016,Patsy's Italian Restaurant,5,"New York City, New York"
Lovely stay,We had a short but lovely stay for a wedding weekend. The room and bed (very important) were very comfortable. The staff were very helpful and the breakfast was substantial. Will highly recommend your hotel. Wish we had time to take advantage of your spa and pool.,Date of stay: June 2014,The Bellmoor Inn and Spa,5,"Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"
