The highlight of our holiday...,"I really can recommend it,
If you like authentic bothtrip, an friendly captain,traditional Greek music and fish,its the best choice for your holiday!!
All the time we feel save.
The captain and her assistant always take care of us and the passenger's and explain you everything you want know about fishing .
Unfortunately time was running very fast...
But we hope,we will see us next time again!
Thank you for everything",Date of experience: September 2020,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
