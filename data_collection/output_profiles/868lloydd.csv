"Great view, hidden gem","Great view - be wary of the menu, some good options but some awful. Pizza was definitely frozen and just ovened for 10 mins, whereas chicken baguette not so bad. Lemonade was nice and refreshing. Recommend for a view and nice drinks to be safe.",Date of visit: September 2020,Rainbird Bar,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
Brilliant experience - definitely worth time and money,Fantastic experience - great views as you leave the city and then some brilliant fun fishing for a couple of hours. Quick swim around the caves and hop back out for you bbqâ€™d fish for lunch/dinner. Great fun and trying to persuade my other half to do a second trip in the same week.,Date of experience: September 2020,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,4,"Rhodes, Greece"
