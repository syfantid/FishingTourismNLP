TREATED LIKE FAMILY!!,"Dimitrios and Efthimia are wonderful hosts, very attentive to our needs and they made us feel like family on this beautiful boat with a toilet on board. This boat only takes 12 people max on a trip, My family of 7 with another family of 4, made this feel like a semi-private tour. They charge $75.00 Euros and is worth every penny. If you like to eat fresh seafood from your catch, it does not get any better or fresher than this, The lunch was outstanding, using tomatoes and herbs from their own private garden for Greek salad and potoes with olive oil from their olive trees, plus homemade white wine that puts Rebola to shame in my opinion.
I would definately recommend this tour without any hesitation, as this will now be a tradition any other time we come to Kefelonia in the future.
THANK YOU DIMITRIOS AND EFTHIMIA FOR A VERY MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE!!",Date of experience: July 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
