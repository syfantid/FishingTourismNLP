What a special place this is. Service was great.,"Covid spacing in place, and all staff wearing face masks. Not the cheapest of restaurants, but still value for money. Would certainly return.",Date of visit: August 2020,La Pergola,4,"Lyndhurst, United Kingdom"
Why look elsewhere ?,Met at the door on arrival. Covid safe environment. Super breakfasts. Good size room. Ernesto (The owner) and Buddy were so welcoming and friendly. Would go back again in a heartbeat. Thank you so much.,Date of stay: August 2020,Rufus House,4,"Lyndhurst, United Kingdom"
Why look elsewhere ?,"Friendly staff. They cannot do enough for you. The rooms are spotless (even under the beds!)
This was our second visit and they did not disappoint. It is certainly worth opting for the breakfast as well. Absolutely spoilt for choice.
We love it. FANTASTIC",Date of stay: July 2019,Kaboom Hotel,4,"Maastricht, The Netherlands"
SOOOOO friendly and helpful,"We loved our stay at the Kaboom. Rooms very clean, reception staff friendly and helpful. Great location. What more could we want. Oh, and a fantastic restaurant just next door.
Parking is available within walking range.",Date of stay: October 2018,Kaboom Hotel,4,"Maastricht, The Netherlands"
OMG ! What a great day out.,"In our opinion this trip out is a must do. From start to finish were made to feel welcome, and within 30 minutes of boarding the boat, we felt that we were with friends that we had known all along. Antonia and Michalis, and their lovely daughter Nikki who also joined us, were superb hosts, and our lunch consisted of our ""catch"" for the day - lobsters - with home grown veg and home-made wine!. It happened to be my birthday, and turned out to be one of the most memorable I have ever had. We even had cake. What a lovely personal touch. Thank you Antonia and Michalis",Date of experience: June 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Staff Great - Hotel tired !,"Just returned after 2 weeks in beautiful Kefalonia at Karavados Beach Hotel. Staff were absolutely wonderful and rooms were kept clean and bedding changed often. However .... we felt that the hotel itself had seen better days and in our opinion, in dire need of maintenance. The room decor was very 1970,s with no choice of tv channels other than BBC world news. The beds were so hard, it felt like we were sleeping on a set of the flintstones ! Most of the lighting around the pool and terrace areas, which looked inviting in the promo pictures !, didnt work. The website pics have tablecloth covered tables around the pool area but in reality, there was no table dressing around pool area and nothing ""inviting"" about the evening dining experience at all. It one point, we were told that the hotel was at full capacity with every room taken, and yet we were the only ones at the bar ! There were some areas around the hotel grounds, that looked like they had seen better days, including what was once an outdoor large chess set, but these were lying in broken pieces around the back. We went half board, and had to queue up for dinner which was served up ""school dinner"" style, on cold plates, and left a lot to be desired. On talking to other guests that had not gone half board but had ordered separately from the a La Carte menu, the reports of the food were generally good. Consequently, by paying half board up front, the food was of a much lower standard! We had a few days of rain, which of course cannot be controlled, but as the hotel was situated in such a remote area with no shops or entertainment nearby, we felt that it would have been a nice touch to have some board games etc available to wile away the hours. So it would be prudent to budget extra spends for car hire. The hotel did run a free bus service to the capital twice a week, but only gave you a couple of hours there before the journey back. Taxi would be about 20 euros. All in all, the staff, especially Peter at the bar who was so helpful and friendly and couldnt do enough for you, were all lovely. We would have liked to have said we would go back again, but unless the hotel underwent some much needed modernisation and a change of customer satisfaction ideals, then sadly, we would not return to this hotel. Our opinion - 3 star hotel with a huge potential for 4 star or above.",Date of stay: June 2018,Karavados Beach Hotel,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Long weekend break,"Excellent service. Reception manned 24 hours a day. Always willing to help. We were so impressed. All staff bent over backwards to accommodate any requests. Breakfast was excellent. Parking available nearby for an extra cost, but this is worth paying for as street parking very hard to find. This needs to be booked when you book the Hotel. This is a family run Hotel, with a personal touch all the way. We loved it. Looking forward to going back again. Tony and Mandy",Date of stay: November 2015,Hotel Prado,4,"Ostend, Belgium"
