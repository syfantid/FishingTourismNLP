Fabulous villa and hospitality!,"I echo previous reviews in that the photos just don't do this villa justice! The villa is comfortable and clean with all the facilities you could wish for. The views from the villa are stunning, both from the windows and balcony of the villa and from the pool area. There is seating on the balcony so you can eat your meals in awe at the amazing view! On arrival we were greeted by a fabulous meal made by Gerassimos' mother - much appreciated after our journey (especially by our 2 hungry teenagers!). The fridge was stocked with bread, milk, fruit juices, fruit, veg .....I could go on! Where else would you find such a warm welcome! Later on in the holiday we were treated to another homemade meal of stuffed vegetables and potatoes - delicious!! Spartia is a great location for exploring the island and we found that the best of the sandy beaches are on this side of the island. Spartia beach itself was great for snorkelling - we often stayed round the pool until late afternoon and then headed for the beach when it wasn't as hot! On the first evening we walked to Spartia Beach and although it's only 2km it is quite a trek back as it is mainly uphill!! In the car it is only 3-4 minutes. I would thoroughly recommend this villa and if we were to return to Kefalonia again in the future, I would not consider anywhere else. A big thankyou to Gerassimos' mother for her generous hospitality!
(car hire - we hired from Greekstones Car Hire: brand new car, reasonable price and the whole process was seamless from beginning to end - I would recommend them)",Date of stay: August 2018,Villa Belesonis,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Great day out!,Would recommend Yellow Boats. They are very professional and definitely have your safety at the heart of all they do. We enjoyed finding all the small coves and beaches and snorkelling from the boat. A great day out for all the family!,Date of experience: August 2018,Yellow Boats Kefalonia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Superb day out!,"We booked the trip via email when we arrived on the island, we received a prompt response and were able to book a day convenient for us. We have 2 teenagers and they thoroughly enjoyed the day, although it would also appeal to younger children aswell. When the nets start to come up with the abundance of fish in them it is fascinating for both adults and children alike! Our 18 year old son enjoyed the challenge of taking the fish out of the nets! Lobster, baraccuda, cray fish, scorpion fish, pig fish, stingray to name just a few!! We were then treated to visiting a few coves where we were able to swim from the boat whilst Efi and Dimitrios prepared the fish. The meal that was prepared was amazing! - all the fish that had been caught had been cooked and served with fabulous salad, bread and washed down with wine and beer! A perfect day out which was the highlight of our 2 weeks on Kefalonia - thankyou!! If we ever re-visit the island, we would not hesitate to do this trip again.",Date of experience: August 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Larger than it looks on the photos!,"Just returned from a 2 week stay at To Spiti Mas. This is a beautiful property set on the hillside overlooking the Libyan Sea - when we walked in we were blown away! The views from the balcony are stunning. The house is very comfortable and beatutifully decorated throughout - we did think that the property overall is much larger than it looks in the photos on the website! The bedrooms are large and the 'fifth' bed is a substantial single bed which pulls out from under a sofa (our 25yr old son slept on it with no issues at all). We actually wheeled it into one of the other bedrooms to take advantage of the air conditioning!! The pool was great - the kids loved it!! The roads around this area are a little scary at times - cliff edge roads with no crash barriers, hair-pin bends and plenty of steep climbs that our Toyota Auris could only manage in first gear! It is about a 45 mins drive through these roads to the nearest main town of Spili - a beautiful little town which we enjoyed exploring. Pegasus Resort is only a 2 minute walk to the top of the drive where you will find great hospitality and fantastic food (not to mention the copious amounts of complimentary Raki!!) Ligres beach was our favourite of the beaches nearby - it was very calm on our first visit when we enjoyed snorkelling, but on our subsequent visit it was like visiting a Cornish beach the waves were that high due to the wind! A great little taverna here also ; super food at very reasonable prices. We had read the reports about 'the wind' in this area and didn't really know what to expect! For a few days the wind was reasonable and really rather pleasant as it kept the temperature down, it then whipped up into a frenzy for a few days and we had to hastily leave the beach due to being sand blasted!! It meant that sitting on any of the beaches wasn't very pleasant - even the more sheltered beaches were still extremely windy. We were never kept awake by the wind, it wasn't a huge issue and wouldn't stop us visiting in August again. We used JustRentals car hire and collected and returned our car at Chania Airport - would definitely recommend them ; fantastic car and no hidden costs! Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and had an extremely relaxing 2 weeks holiday. Thankyou Judy and John!",Date of stay: August 2017,"Traditional Stone Villa (To Spiti Mas) Agia Paraskevi, near Triopetra,",5,"Crete, Greece"
