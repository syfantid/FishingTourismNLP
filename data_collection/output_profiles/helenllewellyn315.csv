What a day!,"We have just spent the day of Dimitris and Efiâ€™s fishing boat. What a fabulous trip, we would highly recommend this experience. This is our 3rd visit to Kefalonia and by far the best thing we have done. Dimitris and Efi are such welcoming hosts and we were fortunate to have some lovely Italian fishing companions for the day. We got to see beautiful coastline and beaches only accessible by boat. After helping empty the fishing nets, we were taken to paradise beach and swam in the sea while Efi prepared a magnificent lunch with the catch of the day...so delicious!
The trip is restricted to a maximum of 12 people so it feels very personal. If you are looking for a trip that is a little different and great value for money, then this is for you!",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Dimitrios-Efthimia,5,"Cephalonia, Greece"
