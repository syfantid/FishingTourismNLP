The best thing I ever did in Greece!,"Professional fisherman with a big heart guide you for the best adventure in Rhodes.

Soft drinks and alcohol is served during all the journey. Diving in the middle of the sea and a tour in the old city from the sea side.

After the adrenaline of the fishing The captain makes an extraordinary lunch/dinner with fish bread and Greek salad.

We fished small fish, barracudas and tunas.

Canâ€™t remove the smile of my face even a week after.

Have to do it again for sure.
Thank you captain Vasilis!",Date of experience: September 2018,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,5,"Rhodes, Greece"
