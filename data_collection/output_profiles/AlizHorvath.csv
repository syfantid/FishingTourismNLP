Fishing in Zakynthos,"Our family ( two kids, 10 and 13) spent an unforgettable day on ship Panagia in August 2018. Captain Giorgos Nikolatos showed us everything concerning fishing with a net, and he answered our numerous questions with pleasure. We had the best sea food lunch of our life, it was cooked on the ship from the catch of the day, and it was super delicious. Kids loved every minute of the day, especially when they could jump into the water from the ship. We also tried to help with taking the fish out of the net - pretty tricky, almost like solving a puzzle :)). The ship was perfectly clean, shiny white, so even as a guest we felt very comfortable. I highly recommend this trip to anyone interested in fishing, or for those who would like to get a little bit deeper knowledge of the place, or the life of Zakynthian people.
