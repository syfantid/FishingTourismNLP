"Good food, lousy service","We had high expectations of Khe Food Garden due to word of mouth. It has a nice ambiance and the dishes we ordered were all tasty. Quite pricey compared to other restaurants located nearby with similar ambiance etc. Our issues was with the service. We had booked ahead online a table for 10. We arrived to a table of eight squished in between 2 other parties and were expected to all squeeze in. When we raised this concern the staff kept telling us that it was only temporary and that they would move us shortly. 30 to 40 minutes later and our food starts arriving, we literally can't even mive in the confined space and ask about our table. They tell us to WAIT until the people next to us finish eating...even though they just started. We tell them we booked a table - the response? Sorry we are too busy so we have no tables. Absolute garbage!!",Date of visit: July 2019,Khe - Food Garden,4,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"
Fantastic!,"Went here with my mum and 2 sisters. The entire booking process was easy, the staff were prompt with replying etc. Tge pick up and drop off service is an added bonus. Refreshments were provided both pre and post treatment. We all had the Balinese massage which was amazing. The spa itself is clean and pretty. Staff were really friendly.",Date of experience: September 2018,Ubud Traditional Spa,4,"Ubud, Indonesia"
"Really nice hotel, a bit far from central station though","Really nice hotel, clean and spacious. Offered all the essentials etc. Buffet breakfast was great with plenty of options. Staff were all really friendly. Its a shame it isn't located centrally - it is located about 25 - 30mins from the Muenchen HBF station.",Date of stay: August 2017,H4 Hotel Muenchen Messe,4,"Munich, Germany"
Nice hotel located close to public transportation.,"The room is rather spacious which is great - the bathroom is located outside of the room - just opposite your allocated room. Each bathroom is private and is only accessible with a keycard that corresponds to your room. Basic amenities are provided eg. Kettle, cutlery, microwave etc. All the staff were really lovely with the exception of one cleaner - we had been out all day and returned at around 5pm. On entering the room we found a used teaspoon in the sink, my friends bottle of tea had been taken out of the fridge and left on the counter and our rubbish bag was left on the closet. My friend promptly went to reception whilst I went to have a shower. The manager was really lovely and apologized...my friend saw him turn the corner to speak to the cleaner who started yelling and complaining that he couldn't clean because I was in the shower etc. This definitely left a sour taste in our mouths.",Date of stay: August 2017,Amsterdam Teleport Hotel,4,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
Centrally located hotel,This hotel is a great place to stay esp. If it is your first time in Brussels. It is 5 mins from the central station. Its located within the Grand Place and there are lots of places to eat in the surrounding area. Very convenient location!,Date of stay: August 2017,Ibis Brussels Off Grand Place,4,"Brussels, Belgium"
Quaint hotel with VERY thin walls.,"The hotel itself is very quaint and cute. Our room was clean, spacious and very comfortable. Breakfast was nice. It is only 5 mins walk to the Markt Square and maun attractions, but far away enough for it to not be crowded and noisy. Shame that it does not have an elevator so if you have luggage this may be a problem. Our only complaint is that the walls are far too thin. You can hear everyone walking up and down the stairs & hall ways. We had a very...amorous couple next to us, needless to say you don't want to be hearing other people have sex at odd times throughout your hotel stay!",Date of stay: August 2017,Hotel Ter Brughe,4,"Bruges, Belgium"
Service was a let down.,"For a buffet, the choices offered were good - there was a nice variety and we esp. liked the grill - seafood was cooked really well. The food itself was delicious and there wasn't anything which i had chosen that i didnt like. However, we were really disappointed with the service. Despite other tables being offered time and again to have their plates cleared or to get refills of the drinks - we were bypassed the entire time!! At one stage we had 4 empty plates to be cleared and by then we had still only been served the lemonade which gets given as a starter. We physically had to ask a waiter to serve us - despite him having served the two tables next to us twice with drinks etc.",Date of visit: August 2017,Tr√≥fea Grill Restaurant Downtown,4,"Budapest, Hungary"
Best massage!,"I booked myself in for the 5hr 'head to toe' package and it was SO worth it. The lovely lady who looked after me was really nice, ensuring i was always comfortable etc. She was also very thorough when applying and performing the body scrub. The massage itself was amazing!! The atmosphere is lovely, and the i loved the choices of tea and massage oils.",Date of experience: August 2017,5 Elements Balinese Day Spa,4,"Budapest, Hungary"
So worth it!,"We actually came to know of Turkiye Balloons through our airbnb host who as a local recommended this place - which says a lot! We were picked up from our lodging and dropped off at the office where there was a buffet breakfast and payment was made. Once all the paperwork was done, we were driven to the take off site - our pilot Erdal greeted us on the mini van and gave us brief introductions and safety instructions. Erdal and the crew were all very obliging & knowledgeable. Erdal alsp has a great sense of humour. All in all an amazing experience to see Cappadocia 600m above ground as the sun rises in thw horizon!",Date of experience: August 2017,Small Group Cappadocia Balloon Ride Tour with Buffet Breakfast,4,"Goreme, Turkey"
Awesome day out at sea,"We booked this fishing tour to cap off our stay in Santorini - and it was definitely worth it! Anthi and the crew were very lovely, always around to explain about the catch of the day, netting processes etc. They helped us out with fishing rods etc and kept us updated about what to expect through out the day. The views from the ocean were spectacular, lunch prepped on board was delicious. We docked at a beautiful swimming area - towels and snorkeling equipment provided by the crew. Definitely would sail with them again!",Date of experience: August 2017,Santorini Traditional Fishing Experience with transportation,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Split level apartment with views to die for.,"We booked this apartment for 3 nights - first time in Santorini and wouldn't even bother looking elsewhere when we come back! The villa is modern, clean and spacious with a large open balcony where the hot tub and amazing view is. ALL the staff were exceptional through out our stay - shout out to Marcus the hotel manager who went above and beyond with his customer service. We hired a quad bike and that took us around 10mins to get to nearby Fira.",Date of stay: August 2017,Villa Irini Santorini,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Must Do in Interlaken!!,We booked last minute online via Outdoor Interlaken (who were very helpful and prompt) and had an AMAZING experience!! The whole crew (driver and pilots) had a great sense of humour and were very friendly. The weather had been shocking throughout the day and they tried their utmost best to get us up onto the mountains so that we could fly. Nick and Drew were our pilots and both were fantastic!! Definitely recommend flying with this team. An unforgettable experience!,Date of experience: July 2017,Tandem Paragliding Experience from Interlaken,4,"Interlaken, Switzerland"
Great food & friendly staff,We had a fantastic meal at this quaint Irish pub - baby back ribs for my friend and beef cheeks for myself. Both were cooked to perfection! Staff were super lovely! Nice atmosphere.,Date of visit: July 2017,The Tells Brew Pub,4,"Interlaken, Switzerland"
Lovely!,"Lovely day spa around Chinatown. Staff were really friendly and explained everything.

I thoroughly enjoyed my experience, the massage was particularly good! Left feeling totally relaxed!

One improvement: make the walls thicker. Could hear everything next door and outside which can disrupt the relaxation.",Date of experience: October 2014,Afond Boutique Spa,4,"Singapore, Singapore"
Not worth what you pay.,"This is not my first time in Singapore and I've stayed at my fair share of hotels. The Seacare is about 20-30minutes from the airport by taxi and about 5-10minutes walk to the closest MRT. Rooms are decent sized and clean. Our sink was blocked but this got attended to quickly and that's about all I can say positively about the place.

There is coffee but not tea, no tissues available, only 14 TV channels (and of those almost half are in a foreign language or frozen or only have TV shows on a few hours a day), I noted a small bloodstain on my bed sheet and even after asking for bedsheets to be changed, the stain is still here on my fifth night! Toiletries aren't of good quality either.

Checkin was a hassle as for some reason although they approved my early check in, on arrival there was nothing on the system-and the girl didn't even read the check in properly...

As for in room dining, what's the point if I have to go down to the restaurant to look at the menu?!?! Then I was told they couldn't bring my meal upstairs!

I've stayed in a lot of hotels for this price before and amenities and service has been a lot better. Wouldn't recommend it or return.",Date of stay: October 2014,The Seacare Hotel,4,"Singapore, Singapore"
