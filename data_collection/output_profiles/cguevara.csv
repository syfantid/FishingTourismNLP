Fabulous steak!,"My wife and I live on the island and to be honest we don't venture into Kalamaki to eat that often however last night (Monday) we did and we left raving about this restaurant, we were warmly welcomed at the door by the staff nothing pushy nothing intrusive a genuine felt welcome, now to the food,.. we decided against a starter and ordered our mains, both selected T Bone which comes with salad chips and a choice of sauce whilst waiting in the mains a selection of complimentary bread and dips were provided. The food here is all cooked fresh so be prepared to wait, that really should be seen as a bonus rather than a negative. Steak arrived.... 1 medium well 1 medium rare, both cooked to perfection, absolutely delicious we've lived here a year and that's the finest steak yet, how good was it? On my t bone I couldn't tell you what was the fillet side, yes it was that tender. They have a wide and varied selection of food inc their range of steaks none of which are over expensive the t bones were €19.50 inc salad and chips - all in all this was a tremendous meal.",Date of visit: August 2020,The Vintage,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Absolutely outstanding!,"We were invited to join our friends here for dinner, they had eaten here a couple of times before and were highly impressed, by the end of the evening we all were, this new restaurant is a must visit if you are locals (as we are) or visitors to the area.
Complimentary bread and dip for the table whilst we looked at the menu, We shared 2 starters which given the size of them was more than ample, we had main courses of Fillet beef linguini, stuffed calamari, salmon and a prawn linguini, all 4 were sensational. Shared 2 desserts, Cherry cheesecake and lemon tart... again absolutely delicious. Jasmine has a very select menu please don't be put off by this, the selections available are to the highest standard and are wide varied to suit all tastes. The prices are very reasonable, the quality of food, presentation and service is exceptional. The restaurant itself is warm and vibrant with a very relaxed atmosphere, inside and outside seating is available.",Date of visit: June 2020,Jasmine Bar Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Awesome,"The biggest compliment I can pay is that when eating here tonight it didn't feel like a restaurant the welcome was so warm the food so delicious it felt like we were eating in someone's home, the food is served platter style and wow is there plenty of it! For 2 (my wife and I) very large salad, tzatziki, chips, cheese pie, cheese and ham pasta, beef stew in sauce, bread and olive oil.. enough? Oh no they then bring 2 pork souvlaki 2 chicken pieces, 2 bifteki and 2 pork belly's! What a serving of good this is. Alexsis is relatively local to us and we've been meaning to visit for a long time, on tonight's evidence I'm sorry we left it so long, suffice to say we'll be back again soon.",Date of visit: June 2020,Stou Aleksi,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
A new favourite has been discovered!,"Visited Ethnic last night on the recommendation of our neighbours who absolutely rave about the place, we were not disappointed, the food was delicious and the portions very generous, we shared a starter of onion rings and chilli dip, my wife had the grilled chicken breast with chips and salad she couldn't decide which sauce to have no problem says the owner(Gina) have a side plate of both... I had the medium rare roadhouse steak with chips and salad, cooked to perfection, coffee to finish off (no room for dessert!) just to add the food is only part of the attraction albeit a big part but this is a family run restaurant with a welcome as wide as the ioanian sea, Gina and her two sons could not have been more attentive, they also provided general tips to us as we make our new life here on the island, whether your a tourist or a local Ethnic should be added to your list of eating places to try. You won't regret it. To Gina and the Boys a big hearty Scottish thank you and we'll see you again soon.",Date of visit: June 2020,Ethnic,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Lovely meal close to the Acropolis,"My wife and stopped off here for a quiet meal, staff were very helpful spoke through their menus and specials and each and every one of them has a take to tell! We stayed true to their Greek specialties which were delicious, the beef in pasta with tomato sauce was exquisite.",Date of visit: December 2019,Liondi Traditional Greek Restaurant,1,"Athens, Greece"
A little diamond!,"We found this little place by accident whilst on an Athens City break, during that break we ate in larger places we ate in posher places we certainly ate in more expensive places but in all honesty this small place (caters more for takeaway but approx 5/6 tables) held its own for friendliness, for taste for freshness and for value for money, if you are passing please do not be put off by the exterior it's not high end dining but it's delightful absolutely delightful, a special thanks to the two guys working they were very knowledgeable and extremely helpful to us.",Date of visit: December 2019,Wok Box,1,"Athens, Greece"
Delicious Food,"Visited this restaurant with my wife during a city break, was pretty quiet that night can't understand why as the food was delicious! Very welcoming couple met us at the door, portions are generous if you like your curry I would recommend the Delhi Curry based on the old fashioned recipe, we had a mixed starter rice and a Pashwari Naan(to be honest that was a bit dry but that may be more about our personal taste) all in all a lovely place with very very good food, and if the owner reads this... if you have another trip to Bonnie Scotland make sure your boy takes warm clothes!",Date of visit: December 2019,Namaste Indian Restaurant,1,"Athens, Greece"
Amazing,"You cannot visit Athens and not see this, it truly is jaw dropping, couple of tips avoid the sunnier parts of the day, take plenty sun screen, hat and water! But be prepared to be star struck",Date of experience: December 2019,Acropolis,1,"Athens, Greece"
An amazing stay,"My wife had a hospital appointment in Athens, travelling from Zakynthos to Athens can be stressful so we decided to stay a few nights and see some of the city sights, well the hotel is right on the doorstep of the crown jewel that is the Acropolis unbelievably the rooftop jacuzzi looks directly onto the magnificent sight, relaxing in the jacuzzi at night with an illuminated back drop of the Parthenon is what dreams are made of... incredible. The hotel overall is spotless, rooms are extremely well furnished, for our stay we added breakfast and we were not disappointed the daily selection was wide and varied, but the jewel in the crown is the staff, nothing was a problem everyone pulled together as a team, they really do make this hotel very very special, on our departure we had a quick chat with the General Manager again a very down to earth helpful man, whether he recalls or not I was the one with the political t shirt relating to an ex UK prime minister! When we return to Athens and I have no doubt we will at some point, the Herodion will be our choice to stay if available.",Date of stay: December 2019,Herodion Hotel,1,"Athens, Greece"
Delicious Lunch,"Went for lunch here whilst waiting for the ferry home to Zakynthos, a Greek friend had told us that the baby squid in particular was delicious, he wasn't wrong! My wife had chicken skewer and salad I had the squid with garlic bread all 3 were generous portions, bottle of water and a complimentary dessert, €18 an absolute bargain. Staff very helpful, restaurant spotless, clearly a favourite with locals and those waiting or arriving on the various ferry's",Date of visit: November 2019,Sou-Mou,1,"Kyllini, Greece"
A welcoming homely place to eat and chat,"My wife and I visited Mageirrion whilst in Rio/Patras to be honest we found the place by mistake and are we glad we did find it, beautifully decorated inside the restaurant has built out to encompass to large trees quite an ingenious piece of work, we were made to feel very welcome by the staff, shown to a table and then given a run through of what was on the menu including some freshly made authentic Greek dishes, we settled for warm bread, a small Greek salad, a chicken and pepper type stew and a local take on a moussaka dish each and every one were delicious, large water for drink, bill came in at under €20 (albeit this may be a winter price)
I would heartily recommend a visit",Date of visit: November 2019,Mageireion Koukoutsis,1,"Rio, Greece"
Below Average,"Visited Taj Mahal following trip advisor reviews to be perfectly honest we left extremely disappointed, first of all the waiter was warm and welcoming... I've nothing much more positive to add, the restaurant was cold yes it's November but there are heaters available don't leave your clients (as they were at other tables) eating whilst wearing jackets, starters of veg (2 pieces) and chicken pakora ( 4 pieces) were ok however like other parts of the meal gave the impression of being from a frozen ready made selection rather than freshly made, dips for both mint and sweet chilli were very nice, mains chicken Malaya was sweet a korma type dish served with a pashwaari naan which again looked and tasted as if it was pre packed, other main was lamb madras ... lamb was as tough as I've ever tasted on the island, the madras sauce was mildly hot but when left to sit the sauce split and there was clear water at the top of the dish again it tasted and gave the impression of being a pre pack heat up dish, served with boiled rice which was actually very decent, with the exception of the chicken pakora the portion sizes were pretty small given the prices of each dish, all in all a very disappointing visit.",Date of visit: November 2019,Taj Mahal,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Welcomed as friends treated like family,"Seacret Beach remains (in our opinion) the friendliest beach restaurant/bar in Tsilivi - some of the recent negative posts have really surprised us, a new season an updated menu and some new staff brings change, the changes particularly relating to the menu were done to improve things for us the visitor, it does take time to settle, however if you have any concerns or indeed suggestions to improve things then speak to the family they are always on duty and always willing to listen, Annie, Takis, Ioannis, Peggy and Irana are amongst the most receptive hosts you'll meet on this beautiful Island of ours. Come and see for yourself!",Date of visit: July 2019,Seacret Beach Bar Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
If you do one trip in Zante - do this one!,"We now live in Zakynthos and this trip was recommended to us by friends they raved about it so much we booked and took along our daughter and her partner, leaving from the Port of Zakynthos we headed out to sea, George (Captain) explained what we would do and what we would see over the day, swimming trips were organised and undertaken, George gave us a running history not only of the island but also the Zakynthos way of life, the importance of sustainable fishing and the role people play, we were all encouraged to help the crew drop the fishing nets the catch from which would be our delicious lunch later, Red Mullet, Octopus,Sea Bream with side dishes of spaghetti salad and bruschetta all cooked on board by Georges amazing mother in law who also doubles up as an FBI Agent (we think that may be false as she looked more CIA) all in all a truly magnificent day made all the more pleasurable by good company on board from Sweden and Slovenia and also a very welcoming crew. Yammas George from Joe Ann Mairi and Dan - ps we plan to be back",Date of experience: July 2019,Zante Fishing Tours,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
A Hidden Gem,"Premier is off the main road area of Tsilivi however please take the time to locate it you will not be disappointed, it is relatively close to the beach, we ate here tonight along with our two friends, starters were a joy, ranging from tzaziki to spicy beef - main courses consisted of Fishermans Chicken (with prawn) my wife and our friend accepted Sakis suggestion of a ""Lamb Surprise"" and I had marinara pasta loaded with sea food - 3 desserts (2 ice cream with strawberry and a home made cheesecake, staff were absolutely charming whilst our friends are well known to the restaurant we were treated by the staff as if they'd known us for years. All in all a truly wonderful experience - thank you Sakis and staff!",Date of visit: June 2019,Premier Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Amazing evening,"Visited Prosilio tonight on the recommendation of a friend, wow we were not disappointed. Starters were delicious, the main courses cooked and presented to perfection and the desserts... well please leave room for the dessert. Service from Yogo and his staff was faultless.",Date of visit: June 2019,Prosilio,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Lovely Meal,"Popped into one of our favourite Tsilivi restaurants tonight, as usual the food was thoroughly enjoyable - would recommend a visit to anyone who is in or around Tsilivi - Special thanks to Thanasis for the Banoffe pie which was magical",Date of visit: June 2019,Calypso Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Delicious food,"Very new restaurant in Tsilivi and we decided to give it a try, we were not disappointed, warmly welcomed at the door by Alex the owner was a nice touch. Tzaziki and hot home made bread to start followed by two main courses of Beef Stifado and Rooster Ragout both were delicious, all in all a lovely meal in a very nice restaurant. Well worth a visit.",Date of visit: May 2019,Estia,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
A welcome return,"Once again treated very well by Ioannis and the team, excellent sunbeds and brolly for only €7 a pair per day, cooling shower and toilets available, food and drink very reasonably priced, short walk into the sea, always a pleasure to see the team, we'll be back again in September. Joe and Ann from Glasgow",Date of visit: July 2017,Seacret Beach Bar Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Welcomed back and treated like family,"Return visit to Calypso and it was as if we had never been away, made very very welcome by Kostas (and Mummy Kostas the inspirational Sous Chef!) food remains a delight, new menu this summer which thankfully has also retained some Greek classics, the Lamb Giovettsi is absolutely unsurpassable, as for the banoffee pie... we are dinner in other places and returned afterwards for Kostas banoffe pie, yes it's that good, lovely also to see Angela and her beautiful baby boy, booked again to return to Tsilivi 13/09 our first stop for food and catch up with friends be Calypso.",Date of visit: July 2017,Calypso Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Disappointing,"On arrival first room was dreadful - room was dirty, bathroom black mould we were moved to another room which was clean but not what you would expect for 4star. Food was cold most of the time. You could only get one bottle of water at a time in dining room which was frustrating when you ask for one each. Staff were very friendly. Heated pool was closed for half our week and was never heated throughout our stay. There wasn't enough seats in the evening for guests and as it was cool at night the bar area inside was exceptionally busy. Also the bar was very busy all the one as only one open for hot and cold drinks in the evening. We had a good week as weather was lovely but Would not return as hotel was not 4 star standard.",Date of stay: February 2017,Occidental Lanzarote Mar,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Pleasant stay,"Lovely room at back of hotel bed very comfortable. Pool, sauna and steam room lovely with robes and plenty towels to use. We didn't stay for dinner, breakfast was ok -cooked breakfast was a bit greasy; fruit and pastries were lovely.

Magnificent,"As a Glaswegian I'm embarrassed to say this is my first visit to this museum and boy have I missed out, fantastic content on show, there's something for all ages including interactive for kids and adults, there are food outlets but we didn't try any although to be fair they did seem busy enough, staff very informative and helpful, my favourite piece had to be Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car, what a sight, go on folks get along, take the kids the parents the grandparents, well done Glasgow!!",Date of experience: January 2017,The Riverside Museum of Transport and Travel,1,"Glasgow, United Kingdom"
Average,"Was in the area and dropped in for a bit of lunch, waterside has two big plusses, the location and views and it's staff, the girls serving were very knowledgeable and attentive without being intrusive, food however was pretty average, we settled for a one course lunch @£9.95 partner had smoked fish pasta with dill and Parmesan, both of us agreed this was pretty bland so much so we asked for further cheese to add some flavour, I had Cajun chicken burger with a portion of chips to be fair this was fine however at £10 it was a bit overpriced in my opinion, bottle of juice at £2.20 is average for this type of place, we decided not to add dessert which was available either as an extra or as part of 2 course deal, all in all the visit was memorable more for the staff assistance and view rather than anything else.",Date of visit: January 2017,The Waterside Bar & Restaurant,1,"Strathaven, United Kingdom"
Magnificent!,"Took my grandson (1 year old) for a visit, absolutely mesmerised with the place, very open airy friendly place, welcoming for visitors of all ages.",Date of experience: November 2016,Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum,1,"Glasgow, United Kingdom"
Good pub food,"Popped in here for a try at the pub themed steak night, wife had the sirloin with the usual trimmings of chips and peas etc I had the large mixed grill, both came with a choice of drink inc soft drink if u wanted, all in good value for just under £18",,The Kirky Puffer,1,"Kirkintilloch, United Kingdom"
Lunch visit,"In for a spot of lunch with my wife, food was ok but nothing spectacular, can be a bit pricey for pub food which is difficult to understand given similar competition in the area, staff are welcoming service was good.",Date of visit: November 2016,Lion & Star,1,"Kirkintilloch, United Kingdom"
Lovely Lunch,"This is a mix of Italian and Indian cuisine, very affordable lunch time and a la carte menu - we both selected Indian, complimentary tasters of poppadoms spiced onions etc were given, both had chicken pakora, was decent portion although mine was a bit dry, partner had rogan josh with naan I had chicken tikka with rice both good portions and very tasty, bill for 2 with soft drink just north of £20 well worth a try",Date of visit: January 2017,Mango The Restaurant,1,"Bonnybridge, United Kingdom"
Fantastic stay,"My wife and I stayed here for two weeks from 30/12/2016 - hotel is spotless, rooms cleaned every day with towels changes as reqd - the food offered is varied and of a very good standard, 2 specialty restaurants available at no extra cost although you must book, our preference was the Spanish one over the Asian. Pool area was large at the time of out visit guests were pre booking sun beds from before 7am that became a bit irritating, pool towels provided and changed when reqd (every am) it's a good 20 min walk to the beach if that's your preference, not really much in the way of shopping or night in the immediate area, however that can be found within relatively short walking distance, wifi is free in public areas you also have opportunity to purchase to use in your room, we were in room 518 overlooking the pool, very comfortable double bed, free safe and fridge, tv in room with varied channel choice, the hotel attracts guests of all nationalities which adds to the atmosphere, we attended the Gala Dinner for new year, we had a bit of a challenge booking a suitable time however this was quickly resolved by the Hotel Manager Senor Andres Pico Conde, a true gentleman and I have to say the hardest working hotel manager I have encountered, this man was on site morning noon and night, always with a cheery smile and a chat for guests and staff, Senor Condes approach was replicated by his staff, in particular Yurena, this girl is an absolute joy a fantastic attitude, bubbly personality and an ability to put all guests old young and very young at ease, entertainment team again were very good, appreciate that some guests don't participate but you can't fault these guys for their effort or hard work, one small point the hotel may wish to review is the use of glasses at or around the pool, with so many kids on site and a growing inability of some guests to return the glasses to the bar this is an accident waiting to happen, overall this was a fantastic break made all the more satisfying by the irrepressible Senor Condes and his staff, Muchos Gracias Senor Condes!",Date of stay: December 2016,Hotel Riu Papayas,1,"Gran Canaria, Spain"
Lovely modern church,"Whilst neither my wife and I are of this faith we were attracted to the bright airy atmosphere at and around the building, we were welcomed to have a look inside, very modern, very welcoming place.",Date of experience: December 2016,Templo Ecumenico El Salvador,1,"Gran Canaria, Spain"
Impressive again,"Another very impressive meal at Ashoka West End, the Himalayan Stew really does hit all the right spots! As usual the staff provide a warm welcome to all.",Date of visit: December 2016,Ashoka Finnieston,1,"Glasgow, United Kingdom"
Don't miss it!,"We returned to the calypso for food after our very positive experiences the last time we visited Tsilivi in 2015 this is a well run restaurant with a wide and varied menu of starters mains and desserts, our particular favourites pasta carbonara for my wife and my own is an absolutely magnificent seafood pasta dish, desserts of banoffe pie or cheesecake finished the meal off... If you have room, on a few occasions we actually came to calypso for dessert after eating mains elsewhere, that says a lot! Staff were exceptionally helpful, my sincere apologies as I can't recall her name but the female staff member was quite magnificent with an eye for detail on every course, Chef Kostas makes the effort to come out and speak to his guests, this is no gimmick this fella is genuinely interested in your feedback to his dishes, if there are special requests re content or prep then it will be sorted, we very much enjoyed each and every visit, never left disappointed with the food, I note that some posters have commented on the wait for food, I'm not the most patient of diners but I am happy to wait that bit longer for freshly prepared food particularly food of this quality, chill folks your on your holidays!",Date of visit: June 2016,Calypso Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Great food,"Lovely family run restaurant with great food, varied menu at decent prices, made very welcome on our visit by a lovely young lady from Falkirk Scotland and her Albanian husband, both took the time to explain the menu, gave us some family history and even offered help with any bank or exchange problems, a really lovely family with a smashing restaurant, please visit u won't be disappointed",Date of visit: June 2016,Pieros Restaurant - Bar,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Good food disappointing room and reception staff!,We were unfortunate to get Room 110 which is very small and noisy due to other hotel guests coming in and out of the building. The bathroom is unsuitable with very little space to get in and out of the bath/shower also the balcony does not get any sunshine at all. The food in the restaurant is variable and of good quality. Most of the staff in the dining room were very pleasant and cheerful with the exception of Benito who could not even look at you when taking your money for your drinks! Unfortunately reception staff were equally unhelpful. Good free wifi coverage in the hotel. Sunbeds-what can I say they are locked until 10am at the poolside-guests queuing at 8-30/9am to get a sunbed on the terrace-not conducive for a relaxing holiday in the sun hence we went to the beach every day! Television channels were good including BBC and ITV. We had a great holiday no thanks to the hotel!,Date of stay: January 2016,Catalonia Oro Negro,1,"Tenerife, Spain"
Value for money,We stayed for a week room was clean looking over the pool (207) twin beds pushed together. Only challenge with room was flooding in bathroom due to shower curtain. Air con and safe were 57 euros for the week. Breakfast was basic. Reception staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel is 10-15 min walk to the main area shops restaurants. Banofee pie in calypso was delicious as was the lemon cheese cake in the olive tree we'd lovely meals in every restaurant. The seacret beach bar had the best sun beds free and the food was excellent for lunch.,Date of stay: August 2015,Petros Hotel,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Best place at the beach,"Excellent sun beds with fantastic comfortable mattresses, delicious food, friendly staff and clean toilets",Date of visit: August 2015,Seacret Beach Bar Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Delicious food great service,"Staff are very friendly, both our meals were delicious good value for money would recommend a visit.",Date of visit: August 2015,Family Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Delicious food friendly staff,We visited twice during our week stay food was delicious on both occasions. We had Greek lamb dishes and the banoffe pie is second to none. We went just for dessert one night too.,Date of visit: August 2015,Calypso Restaurant,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Great Stay,"My wife and I booked an overnight stay at the Edenmore, guest house was lovely, room very modern, very comfortable, breakfast was massive, tv in Room, hairdryer available, fresh water coolers for guests, free access to kitchen area if u wish to use it, guest house is close to many amenities including golf courses and harbour If your looking to travel on, this is a smashing place to stay or to use as a base, and yes it does have free wifi! Thanks Moira for looking after us in May, from Joe and Ann from Glasgow",Date of stay: May 2015,Edenmore Guest House,1,"Ardrossan, United Kingdom"
Very welcoming,"Wife and I stayed in may, very modern room, bathroom had spa bath which was great, absolutely spotless...yes free wifi! Close to many amenities including golf courses and bowls, also close to coast and harbour If looking to explore the west coast all in all we loved our stay, Moira the owner could not do enough for us, very very helpful oh and breakfast was brilliant",Date of stay: May 2015,Edenmore Guest House,1,"Ardrossan, United Kingdom"
Good value for money,"Despite requesting a double bed twice prior to arrival, initial room not good and in need of upgrade (single beds) however we were moved to a better room (339) with a lovely queen size bed. Room was clean, food was excellent, staff were very helpful and friendly. People were queuing to get a sunbed while we went for breakfast on finishing breakfast most sunbeds were reserved-hotel really needs to address this luckily we go the beach however if we wanted to lie at the pool it would have been a challenge! Wi-fi in hotel not great much better in places outside the hotel.",Date of stay: March 2015,Iberostar Las Dalias,1,"Tenerife, Spain"
Top Notch,"The Koh i Noor has a reputation a being one of Glasgow's finest Indian eateries, visited by customers from across the world including a host of celebrities, we hadn't been in for a while but on driving past today my wife and I decided to pop in for Sunday lunch, that was a great decision, Ill take the credit for that!
We were welcomed by the manager who remembered our previous visits, that in itself says something about this place, given the many many customers they have he recalled us despite the fact we hadn't been in for some time, Lovely touch.
We settled for the 3 course Sunday lunch, starters of chicken and vegetable pakora, chicken mughli korma and a chicken dopiaza, fried rice and nann bread, finished off with an ice cream, each course was extremely enjoyable,
3 courses for under £8 each, in any restaurant that is in itself a bargain, when you factor in quality food, quality service in the centre of Glasgow this is a deal that should not be missed.
Suffice to say we will be back, this time we wont be leaving it so long!",Date of visit: September 2014,Koh-I-Noor,1,"Glasgow, United Kingdom"
Excellent food and service,We visited the restaurant to celebrate my wife's birthday and our wedding anniversary. The food was delicious we both had steak fillet and sirloin-cooked to perfection. The waiters were friendly without being intrusive and the lemon meringue pie was warm on arrival and absolutely delightful. Prices were very reasonable-worked out at £35 for our meal and soft drink/water.,Date of visit: September 2014,Restaurant Le Méditerranée,1,"Port El Kantaoui, Tunisia"
Ok but wont be back,"Staff not very welcoming nor friendly. Not offered a seat inside and my wife was bitten badly by mosquitoes. We had steaks, one fillet one sirloin- portion was ok but we were hungry after our meal. The chips and veg with it were a tiny portion. We didn't stay for desserts and noticed we were the only table not given mint tea with their bill. Would not go back or recommend.
Price was fairly reasonable.",Date of visit: September 2014,La Daurade,1,"Port El Kantaoui, Tunisia"
Nice break but improvements needed!,"This was our fourth visit to the Kanta, we had emailed to request a double bed prior to arrival but unfortunately our request was not fulfilled on arrival. Room 21 was offered (ground floor)-beds looked as if someone had slept in them, the balcony door lock was broken, safe was broken and the window seal was hanging out-after a lot of discussion with reception staff and threats to go to another hotel we were offered room 430 which was of the standard we have had previously. The room was superficially clean but the standard of cleaning is not good, mirrors, windows and bath were not properly cleaned the whole week we were there. The food was buffet style variety was ok at times food cold have been warmer, doughnuts no longer served at breakfast which were missed! Waiter service in dining room has declined with many guests being all inclusive. The beach area was clean and the food at the beach was good-more waiters were required only 2 for the volume of customers was not enough. We enjoyed our break and was good value for what we had paid as we got a great cheap deal.The hotel does not seem to recognise returning guests per se although many of the staff were very welcoming recognising we were return guests- asking after other family members.",Date of stay: September 2014,Hôtel Kanta,1,"Port El Kantaoui, Tunisia"
Fantastic staff let down by cold food at times!,"This was our second visit to the hotel. The hotel was spotlessly clean, our room had a double bed as requested (236) and got the sun in the evening, All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Towels and bedlinen were changed very regularly (daily for towels). Unfortunately the food in the restaurant was not always warm never mind hot, this was found over breakfast lunch and dinner. Also the food at the carvery ran out sometimes an hour before the restaurant closed. It would be a shame if this challenge with the food is not resolved as it does detract from what is an exceptionally well run hotel with some of the finest staff we have encountered.",Date of stay: June 2014,Bitzaro Grande Hotel,1,"Zakynthos, Greece"
Wonderful stay-fabulous hotel and staff,"Just returned from a fabulous week at La Solara -we had a lovely welcome to the hotel with complimentary prosecco and nibbles. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We had room 220 which had a beautiful sea view (and double bed) with narrow balcony- only draw back was that there was no wifi in our room and the shower pressure was very low. The hotel was spotlessly clean in all areas. The food was delicious (we were half board) the warm pastries at breakfast were the nicest ever and the evening meals were delicious-if you didn't like the food on offer an alternative was offered. Nello was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and always smiling and Antonio's hair cut defies the laws of physics and he was always quietly professional.The swimming pool area was great plenty free sunbeds and beach towels (beautiful view from the sun terrace over the Mediterranean sea) and the food at the pool bar was as good as the restaurant. We used the hourly free bus to Sorrento both during the day and at night which was excellent.We visited Capri(& Anacapri) and Positano via the local ferry/bus services-both worth a visit although Capri is very expensive. The reception staff were very helpful extremely knowledgeable of the Amalfi area and nothing was too much bother. The trains and bus services were excellent from Sorrento and can be used to access all the sights e.g. Pompeii. Overall fantastic value for money and would recommend this hotel to anyone.",Date of stay: April 2014,Best Western Hotel La Solara Sorrento,1,"Sorrento, Italy"
Really nice lunch,"Visited Antipasti today for a bit of lunch, the restaurant was a favourite of ours some years back,
two course lunch for £6.95 pp excluding drinks, menu available isnt extensive but there is a decent selection that should meet everyone's needs,
I had the minestrone soup for starter, very tasty, possibly could have done with a side of bread and butter but this wasnt forthcoming, also a shaving of parmesan perhaps? for main I had a bolognese and pasta foil bake, very nice indeed.
My wife had the pate to start and chicken pizza both were nice.
decided against dessert on this occasion, there were a selection available for an extra £3 or so.
Meal for 2 with a soft drink (I had water) £15.60p - very good value.
One downside to the eateries is the toilet areas which both could do with a refurbishment,both very dated especially around the wash hand basin area in gents and the WC in the ladies which to be frank is really quite off putting.",Date of visit: April 2014,Cafe Antipasti,1,"Glasgow, United Kingdom"
Low Budget - Dont expect too much,"we travelled as a couple to the callao garden in february 2014 for 1 week HB
let me make it quite clear this was not an expensive stay, nonethless some aspects of the stay were very disappointing,
we were given room 1155 low level room, shower room ceiling was filthy due to lack of extraction, the only ceiling vent was covered in grime, mirror was in poor condition, bedroom wall adjacent to bathroom had excessive dampness resulting in plaster falling off wall, window cill within the room was filthy with dust, electrical socket cracked and broken, kitchen area, work surface has numerous breaks/holes in it and was loose at one section, shelf in living room covered in dust, I did actually wrire please clean me on it, unfortunately that never worked, ceiling fixed fan was noisy, balcony door did not fully lock, fridge was dirty in parts, tv in room provides spanish tv stations for free, other language stations require to be paid for via a metre box in the room....very 1970s! towels were changed every 2 days unfortunately that was about the extent of the domestic service...eating area, food was pretty poor, selection minimal, again I clarify this was not an expensive trip but he basic food choice, presentation and quality was well...basic, add to that not one member of staff asked at any point if as HB clients we would like a drink, cold water was available so we availed ourselves of that. spoke to reception twice re the challenges with the room, very helpful indeed, unfortunately nothing was resolved. all in all its okay for hens or stag short stays, apart from that id suggest you may wish to consider other options,",Date of stay: February 2014,Blue Sea Callao Garden,1,"Tenerife, Spain"
"Good food, great service from the guys","good bar style food, portions of a decent size at very competitive prices, drinks coffess all very reasonable, ideal for a stop off during he day or at night, very attentive staff, free wifi!!",Date of visit: February 2014,Eclipse Bar,1,"Tenerife, Spain"
average,"stopped here for lunxh on the final day, margheritta pizza was very bland, more tomato than cheese, bocadillo chicken salad was okay but nothing special, chips were poor oven ready baked poor fare for an italian style eaterie, reasonably priced",Date of visit: February 2014,Casa María,1,"Tenerife, Spain"
"Great food, shocking accommodation in the apartment","My wife and I booked 2 weeks all inc at RUI Olivina 4* for holiday over the festive period, on arrival we were allocated an apartment (room 245) which to be perfectly frank was less than 2* Room had a lingering odour due to a water pipe that had not been sealed (from a water tank) tiles were at risk of falling from the wall, floor tiles were chipped, access ducts to drains were covered only by plastic, work surfaces chipped and bare, we discussed this with the reception and were told the hotel was full, met with Rep and he advised possible move but likely extra cost, we had already paid over Â£2500 and were reluctant to pay more, Rep arranged a room move which was slightly better, overall we were extremely disappointed with the accommodation provided,discussions with other british holidaymakers showed that at least 20 had complained and were moved. the ""entertainment"" team catered only for the french visitors, night time ""entertainment"" was extraordinary poor, the lack of input from the team during day time was startling, unless you were french! neither the accommodation nor the ""entertainment"" was reflective of what was advertised online which we ultimately relied on prior to booking, the bonus for thomsons was the local rep Jonathan who was extremely sympathetic, understanding and helpful.",Date of stay: December 2013,Relaxia Olivina,1,"Lanzarote, Spain"
Fantastic value for money for delicious food,"My wife and I used sugar and spice every other day for lunch and most evenings for coffee and cakes, the lunch deals just cannot be beaten with chicken or meat kebabs at around £3 each, pizzas at around £4 the staff were fantastic, menu was wide and varied, the ""big steak"" just has to be seen to be believed!
nothing was a problem for these guys, they got to know us due to our regular visits and joked each evening about my wifes fondness for the hot apple crumble....did I say joke? they had the order placed before we had time to sit at the table!
Brlliant stuff and I would recommend any visitors to Olu Deniz to visiy",Date of visit: October 2013,Sugar'n Spice,1,"Oludeniz, Turkey"
Lovely,"adjacent to sugar and spice and clearly in same ownership, wide and varied menu offering good food and great prices",Date of visit: October 2013,Bella Gusto,1,"Oludeniz, Turkey"
Very good experience,"We stayed at the blue lagoon in July 2013 to be honest I wasn't quite sure what to expect as the review on TA were a bit mixed.
We arrived at approx 04.30 and were quickly checked in without any fuss, we had emailed and asked for a double bed this was sorted.
As we had a 17 year old with us we had asked for adjoining rooms again this wasn't a problem.
the Hotel itself was spotlessly clean, towels and linen changed very regularly.
Rooms we had 137/138 overlooked the pool area, they weren't spectacularly fitted but met our needs. The shower room was nice with a good shower.
There was some noise from the bar area on certain nights, usually the Turkish night, the music was loud but this stopped around 1130
Food: Breakfast is continental style, not to everyone's taste and I can understand why some would find it boring, but there was plenty of choice and you could if required purchase an english fry up relatively cheaply.
Lunch menu was available and again was adequate offering the usual type of hotel food, all of a decent standard, we had booked half board and ate in most nights, again he selection was decent, the quality was too, in particular the Ottoman chicken dish..fabulous!
I cant really comment on the bar prices apart from soft drinks which were expensive at around £3 glass, bottled water was around a £1, large beer just under £3
The staff we found to be helpful, in particular the manager George, always on hand, always asking if things were okay, if we needed anything just to ask, a lovely fella, very sincere with a wicked sense of humour.
No real entertainment around the pool the fortnight we stayed apart from one game of water polo, to be honest that never bothered us much, pool itself was cleaned every day,
One wee gripe, the guests tend to book their sunbeds early (one guy was booking his as we checked in!) the vast majority of the guests were British so the old fallacy of blaming other nations dd not stack up!
Guests did tend to mix well, we met some lovely people, Mick and Lynn from London, Dave and his Mrs from Wales and Gary and Sharon from Plymouth, only wish we had met earlier!
Another thing guests should be wary of the is the card payment, no cash is taken at the bar everything charged to your room, I would advise paying your bill however small every morning that way there will be no surprises when you check out, there were suggestions that ""extras"" had been added to some bills, I seen no evidence of that, mistakes will of course happen but I would suggest these are honest mistakes, at the end of the day take ownership of your own spending. At the time of the visit the temp was in the high 30s and touched 40 air con is available in all rooms, think it was £20p/w free to anyone booking through Thomas Cook please consider (where required) paying the extra as it is needed
Olu Deniz itself is a relatively small town, again spotlessly clean, locals are very friendly, shop keepers will try and sell you there wares but they are not pushy with it, remember bartering is expected.
The local bus (Dolmus) is available and will take you far and wide whether its to the market on a tuesday or into one of the larger towns for further entertainment
we ate out most days for lunch, extremely good value in most places, circa £20 for the 3 of us please shop around you'll find something for every taste and budget,
evening meal?
3 soft drinks, 1 fillet steak salad and chips, 1 T bone steak (it was!) and a vegetable stir fry came to under £45
Beach is of pebbles, so shoes are a must, sea current waves are strong so be wary
Lots of boat trips and paragliding available, try the Turkish baths and massage they are brilliant, and gents try a haircut in the town, £6 and it includes head back shoulder arm and hand massage!again shop around for best prices
One last warning, Dalaman Airport is expensive, take sandwiches with you for return flight, George can organise this as well.
This is not a cordon bleu hotel, it is not the Hilton, but it does offer and provide good value for money with the added bonus of a manager who does look after his guests",Date of stay: July 2013,Blue Lagoon Hotel,1,"Oludeniz, Turkey"
"Good food, good prices","Spent a few lunchtimes here, really good value, lunch for 3 approx £20 the waiting staff were very polite, very helpful, beware of the chilli sauce on your kebabs!!",Date of visit: July 2013,Sugar'n Spice,1,"Oludeniz, Turkey"
A hidden gem!,"Just returned last night from a short stay at the Montemar Benidorm, situated two minutes from the beach in the old part of the town, room was fine, cleanliness throughout was excellent, reception staff extremely helpful at all times, restaurant staff are extremely hard working, the food itself could be a bit mixed but the hotel caters for many nationalities, they try to meet all tastes, bear that in mind, also bear in mind your not being charged 4 or 5 * prices, you get excellent value for money in a very well run hotel. We had room 707 which is to the rear of the hotel, no view to speak of but you can upgrade to a sea view if you wish. The view from the front if the hotel is stunning, you are literally 50 yards from the beach with views down the entire coast. One wee note for the maitre if she reads this, please smile, you have a lovely smile don't hide it!!
All in all, smashing hotel, perfectly placed, great value for money.",Date of stay: May 2013,Hotel Montemar,1,"Benidorm, Spain"
Dont expect too much,"Without sounding harsh the cost of the Ponderosa mirrors exactly what you get, but there are certain standards of ANY Hotel that have to be met, unfortunately they were not in this instance.
On check in we were given room 202 by the very polite receptionist, first sight of the room was a shock, the bath had a hole in it, the shower head was totally clogged with old shower gel or shampoo, the WC was badly stained, on return to reception we were (after some debate) moved to Room 318 This Room was an improvement, but to be frank not by much, the decor was tired the toilet/shower area was in great need of refurbishment.

There are two pool areas, both with plenty of sun beds, worryingly during our one week stay we never saw any of the pools being cleaned.
Food:
Firstly the positives, breakfast was by far the best meal of the day, adequate choice and replenished on a regular basis, lunch was a bit hit and miss dependent on who was cooking, the English Chef was very accommodating to all guests irrespective of their nationality, the other (Mario) was a nightmare, when Mario was on duty the food was (a) of a lower standard (b) never enough (c)generally cold when brought out On various evenings we had to ask the waiting staff when the food was coming, trays were left empty for up to 25 minutes or more, on occasion they were never replenished, eg one evening we went to dinner at 19.20 (opens at 1900) no chips, no fish no veg at 20.10 we left to go for a Macdonalds, this unfortunately was not an uncommon event, there was generally (albeit a limited amount of) selection of fish chicken or pork, if I said pork was the chefs main dish you wouldnt be surprised to learn it was on every day, once it was both main courses!
Pasta was avalable every night, as were the exact same two sauces, one cheese, one tomato based
Dessert was good, usually a cream cake, and ice cream, some fruit was available but this was limited to either banana or apple, with sometimes pear
Minimal selection of salad was also available
Ordering drinks could be a challenge at meal times as generally the waiting staff also covered the adjacent bar area
Snacks between meals consisted of a tray of sandwiches left in the bar.....uncovered.
Cleaning standards in and around the hotel were poor, maid service was every 3 days, this included towels, bins, the maids were seen to use the same water for an entire floor when cleaning the rooms, within our room IF you walked on the floor with bare feet, the soles became ingrained with dirt and required scrubbing, and yes I mean SCRUBBING
on various occasions we noticed the wash bucket had water which was totally black in colour, this was reported to reception, hotel staff in general did their best, but there is an urgent need for assessment not only environmentally but also as to how the Hotel itself operates.
Overall if your looking for a cheap week away and your not to fussed then by all means this may fit the bill, on the other hand if your expectations including cleanliness are anywhere close to or above average Id suggest you may have a problem!",Date of stay: January 2013,Ponderosa Apart Hotel,1,"Tenerife, Spain"
Steer clear,"we returned this afternoon from Tunisia, so disappointed with the holiday that my first act is to post this review!
This was our third visit to the Kanta and it pains me to say it but it will most certainly be the last, the seismic decline in the overall experience is frightening,
firstly the positive, the majority of staff remain ever helpful, there are a few whose demeanour and overall attitude leave a sour taste,
the Port itself is a welcoming place and the locals themselves are a joy
Negatives?
during our two week stay we were firstly given The Presidential Suite...to be honest I thought this was a welcome as a returning customer, unfortunately not it was down to the fact the Hotel was overbooked, The Suite was circa 1980s in decoration including carpets which were threadbare, the suite was polluted with flies, and I mean polluted we are talking in their scores, removed I hastened to add by us asking for a fly spray, which worked after about an hour, staff room on demand was changed the next day to one on the 5th floor, far superior,
Food?
Well repetition can be expected during a two week stay, but...the only change in the menu was chicken for turkey on one evening, everything else remained the same,
That in itself wasnt a real hardship, the greatest concern was the fact that EVERY night we returned fish and chicken which was NOT cooked, raw fish (in part) chicken with juices not clear were common, one day at the pool bar we received a chicken sandwich with a piece of totally raw chicken, having spoken to other holidaymakers this was not uncommon, possibly identifying why there was a high rate of tummy upsets, the distinct lack of food hygiene levels is a great concern in my opinion this Hotel is at risk of salmonella or e coli outbreak
on the other hand that could have been down to the pool not being cleaned at all apart from a litter pick each am to remove the leaves,
During our two week stay there were confirmed reports of thefts from within locked safes in locked rooms, we were advised staff were dismissed for the acts, to be honest that was of no comfort, trust had been lost,
we spoke to fellow holidaymakers of various nationalities who had visited the Kanta for the past 6, 7 and 8 years respectively, none will be returning,
The Kanta beach area (along with the public beach) is now extremely dirty, there appears to be no visible attempt to litter pick, whilst the visitors and locals have to accept a portion of the blame for the rubbish there is no excuse for the inordinate volumes of waste that is visible",Date of stay: July 2012,Hôtel Kanta,1,"Port El Kantaoui, Tunisia"
