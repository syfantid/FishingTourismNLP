0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenej25,July 2020,5,Best boat trip ever,"Our family have been on a lot of boat trips but this was the best ever. Nice boat, lots of shade, great scenery  - and then the excitement of watching Giannis spear fish - then every one helped with the whitebait nets and others fished from the boat A lot of fish caught , cooked and eaten for lunch - just perfect  ! We swam and snorkelled , but for our teenagers the highlight was the fishing  Giannis and George were charming hosts and Giannis took the youngestcin his very high speed boat for the last bit - very exciting  Highly recommneded - a great trip‚Ä¶"
1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gyoergy1,October 2019,5,Perfect day on the sea,"We spent a very nice day on the sea. We caught lots of tuna, Giannis knows well the good places. He was also very helpful and made a fantastic lunch for us."
2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilyhR3760BX,September 2019,5,Excellent day out!,Giannis is an excellent host aboard his fishing boat. We booked a private trip for 4 people which was very reasonably priced. 3 fishing lines to share was plenty to catch enough for lunch. A nice refreshing dip in a quiet untouched cove followed by beautifully barbequed fish that we caught just hours earlier. The table was laid out beautifully with a fresh salad and complimentary dips to accompany the catch of the day. Giannis's days spent in the kitchen at Poseidon restaurant was most welcome at lunch! A much recommended trip for those who are passionate about fishing or simply rather enjoy the 5 star views from the front of the boat with a few glasses of local wine üëç‚Ä¶
3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdaHK123,August 2019,5,Amazing Fishing / Lunch trip - perfect for friends or family,"We came to Poros from New York with basically no plans. We went to Poseidon Taverna (lovely restaurant) and asked the owner where we could rent a boat. He said there were no boat rental places on the island but his son (also works at the restaurant) takes groups on fishing trips. You can hire the boat privately for the day, as my fianc√© and I did.  We chose to go spear fishing. The captain, Giannis, is an expert spear fisherman and it‚Äôs amazing to watch him free dive. And his English is great. He caught several fish as we watched with snorkels from the surface. He then grilled the fish on board and served the most delicious lunch, fresh Greek salad, bread and tzatziki (the best meal we have had in Greece!). The boat was beautiful - an upgraded version of an authentic fishing boat with lounge chairs, a picnic table for meals, large canopy for shade, comfortable turf deck and bathroom on board. It was an amazing experience and if you like being on the water, this is a must-do in Poros.  Check out the Facebook page for pictures. ‚Ä¶"

We all caught fish under Giannis guidance to much delight of young and old! Secluded bays for swimming and snorkelling... diving off the boat  followed by a lovely lunch of our catch of the day.
