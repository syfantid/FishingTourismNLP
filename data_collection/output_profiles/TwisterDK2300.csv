Skønt sted lige ved stranden,Very nice situated restaurant just beside the beach - you can even sit directly on the beach beside the big terrace.

A very cosy place with a very good atmosphere. A place you'll come back to.....,Date of visit: August 2020,Boat House Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"
One of the best restaurants in Kamari....,"Dolphins Beach Bar and Restaurant is situated in the heart of Kamari next to the beach, You can sit here watching the moon rises over the sea while eating some of the best food in Kamari. The atmosphere is very nice and friendly and the service is top.
In the daytime they have open for beach customers on their sunbeds where you also can be served with drinks and food.
It's one of our favorite restaurants - a place you'll come back to either for a light meal or for dinner.",Date of visit: August 2020,Dolphins Beach Bar and Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"
The best Santorini boat trip,"Every time we go to Santorini we go on this trip.
It combines authentic fishing, swimming, and the best seafood directly from the sea with a lot of information and knowledge about the animals.
Captain Anthi and her staff - this year Mohammed - gave us again some of our best days of our holiday. You always feel so welcome on board - and all restrictions of the Covid -19 was respected this year.
Every time it so exiting to see what's in the nets that have been set before the trip. Anthi knows every fish and other creatures in the sea and tells us with her great enthusiasm about them and answers all questions with a great knowledge. While swimming in the sea or fishing with your own fishing lines the staff prepares the catch of the day on the grill. It'll be served with rice, bread, frish tomato salad, and grilled squash - a meal which never will be the same dependent on the catch.
There might be two trips per day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon that includes the beautiful sunset.
Don't hesitate to sign up.....it's a trip you'll come back to.....anyway we do.....",Date of experience: August 2020,Giorgaros fishing tours Santorini,4,"Santorini, Greece"

Very fine and clean hotel with atmosphere,"A well-run hotel in the heart of Kamari, Santorini, close to the bus, the center of the village, the many restaurants, and the beach. We have stayed there for several holidays by now and have always been very satisfied with everything there. The breakfast offers whatever you like to start the day with, the pool area offers as well sun as shadow and is a small oasis with umbrellas, palm trees, and very comfortable sunbeds, café chairs and tables next to the pool bar. Here you can relax after your trips around the island or simply stay there the whole day. The hotel has been redecorated within the last year and the rooms are very cozy in the Santorini style. Every room has its own balcony and a perfect air-con. The cleaning is more than perfect and the staff is very friendly and service minded. A really good choice for spending your holiday…",Date of stay: August 2019,Hotel Summer Dream,4,"Santorini, Greece"

During the daytime they also offer you free sunbeds next to the tavern.",Date of visit: August 2019,Taverna Saliveros,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Kamari's cooling oasis,A fantastic place to visit in the heat of Santorini. It’s a cooling oasis under big trees and with special cooling effects in the center of Kamari. The food and drinks are very good and tasty served by the very friendly and service minded staff. If you are a fan of sports you can follow different matches on big screens. It’s a lively place with a good atmosphere as well in the daytime as in the evenings. A good place to take a rest or meet with friends…,Date of visit: August 2019,Aigaion Irish Pub,4,"Santorini, Greece"
A very nice place to eat and drink and enjoy the beach,"We come here every time we are in Santorini because of the very kind staff and the extremely good service and atmosphere.
Beside that the food is well prepared and very tasty, super good food with many traditional Greek dishes. Every day they get fresh fish delivered to the restaurant – so you’ll never be served fish from the freezer as at many other places.
Twice a week you can listen to well played live music in the evenings and during the day the restaurant also offers you free sunbeds on the beach next to it. A place you’ll enjoy in all aspects.",Date of visit: August 2019,Dolphins Beach Bar and Restaurant,4,"Santorini, Greece"
Café med sjæl,"Dejligt og intim stemning i de nyrenoverede rum hvor vi nød Ewalds velsmagende tatar til et godt glas ""husets rødvin. Det er virkelig et sted, der er værd at besøge.",Date of visit: November 2018,Ewalds,4,"Frederiksberg, Denmark"
Marvelous trip.....,"This trip is extraordinary among many others...It's exiting to see what's in the net, so many different and exotic fish which together with a lot of well tasting shrimps gave us all a fantastic lunch. The crew is extremely kind and good to tell us about the fish and what is special about them - and also very carefull to them - the small ones come back into the see....
You also get the opportunity to catch your own fish with fishing rods or just a line. And we maneged !
It's a fantastic trip and we highly recommend it to everybody.

"Calm, clean, and the best service","We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel situated in the middle of Kamari. Four minutes to the beach, three minutes to the bus, two minutes to the best restaurants, and one minute down the stairs to the nice pool area with both shadow and sun for the comfortable sunbeds. Pool bar with food and drinks, a nice place to relax, calm and clean.
The rooms have good beds, fridge and are clean and cosy with balconys either to to pool area or the small silent road. The staff is very friendly and give you the very best Greek service. Good Greek breakfast includes all you need for having a good start of the day to explore this fantastic island.

Dejlig oase med oprigtig rar og personlig stemning,"Absolut den bedste pub i Kamari med et stort udvalg af fadøl og snacks, bedste betjening med humor og glæde, dejlig kølende hygge i palmeløvets skygge og altid tændte HD fladskærme, når de vigtige sportskampe spilles. Et sted, du vil komme tilbage til igen og igen. Kostas og hans medarbejdere tager altid imod dig med ægte græsk charme og omsorg.",Date of visit: August 2014,Aigaion Irish Pub,4,"Santorini, Greece"
