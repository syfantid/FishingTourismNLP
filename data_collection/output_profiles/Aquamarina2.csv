Different,"This was my first visit to the bar in the evening, and it was really busy. Having been during the daytime it was noticeably quiet. We were with some friends and as such a round of drinks was a little on the expensive side. That said, it's a nice contemporary place without loud obtrusive music. There are 2 restaurants attached to the bar, one Chinese and one Indian. If I had one criticism it is that the hallway to the toilets is extremely cold as are the facilities themselves as it appears there is no form of heating. Having spoken to others they have also commented the same. All in all a nice , different type of bar and we'll be back.",Date of visit: February 2019,The Point,4,"Astley, United Kingdom"
Very disappointed,"we ordered a cheese and ham toasted sandwich with coffees and cake. The toastie was not what we expected. It was served to include a piece of processed cheese and a minimal ham. Very bland and a side salad which did not have any tomatoes. The whole place is in need of a total re-furbishment too, which in my opinion would make it more appealing. It is also “dog friendly” which I have no objection too , but others may not like it as there was dogs barking whilst we were eating. The toilet is outside of the main building and is almost completely dark once the door is closed. Overall not the best cafe experience or atmosphere and I won’t be returning.",Date of visit: February 2019,Village Green Tea Room Rivington,4,"Rivington, United Kingdom"
Nice venue,"We spent New years Eve at the hotel for one night for a black tie event. The hotel is in a very nice peaceful coutryside location with beautiful grounds and I can easily see why weddings are popular here. Our meal was very nice and the service was excellent. Our room was a large suite across 2 floors with a large very comfortable bed, however, I felt it was a little tired looking and was in need of modernising slightly. That said the entire place is exceptionally clean. I was also a little dissapointed to learn that the bar did not have a cocktail list , which in my opinion was kind of expected at a 4 star hotel. !! . The staff were all very efficient and friendly , with the exception of the man behind the bar he was non communcative every time we ordered a drink and also seemed very serious. All in all it was a pleasant evening to celebrate NY away from home but we would not rush back.",Date of stay: December 2018,Gibbon Bridge Hotel,4,"Chipping, United Kingdom"
Very happy !!!,"We had booked a table for 3.30pm for a birthday celebration, on arrival we sat in the bar for a drink before the meal and immediately felt that the place was lovely. It is in a beautiful village with stunning views across to Pendle Hill. We were shown to our table in the dining room approx 10 mins early and again this was a lovely room. The menu has lots of different choices and we opted for 3 courses as it was my birthday. The staff are very attentive and service very good. The food served was excellent, all 3 courses and nothing could be faulted. I can't wait to return to this place and would highly recommend it to friends and family.",Date of visit: June 2018,The Assheton Arms,4,"Downham, United Kingdom"
The Best day out,"A fabulous day out fishing with Dimitris on his own boat. We caught 98 fish between 7 people which was excellent and was shared out at the end of the trip. Needless to say we had to give it to one of the tavernas in return for a very cheap dinner. This is a great day out for anybody, couples and families alike.Stopping off for a swim and also lunch. I would love to do it again on another visit to Skiathos",Date of experience: September 2017,SFT Skiathos Fishing Trips,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Outstanding !,"We spent 3 nights in this stunning hotel for my partner's 60th birthday and we enjoyed every second of it. On arrival we were upgraded to a more luxurious room than that I had booked compliments of the establishment. The building itself is absuloutely stunning and everything is done to a high standard. We enjoyed a delicious afternoon tea on the first afternoon, which in my opinion was enough for 4 people , and the evening meal was superb and delicious. Also served with amous bouche !!!. The spa facities are also fabulous with an outside hot tub whilst serving drinks. The staff and very courteous and the service was first class. I would highly recomment this hotel and spa to anybody to spend a special occasion there.",Date of stay: February 2018,Armathwaite Hall Hotel & Spa,4,"Bassenthwaite, United Kingdom"
Dissapointed.,"We started our walk up Sale Fell from this lovely looking pub, and was happy that it was at the end of the circular walk for refreshments. On arrival , we ordered and were told that cake was not served until 3.00pm, (it was approx 2.20pm) and was offered a bowl of home made crisps. !! Another couple arrived soon after and it was clear that they wanted to order lunch, but was told the same. As a result they promptly left . We was very dissapointed after a 2.5 hour walk that we were not able to order anything, and as this is a residential pub/hotel I was mindful that it would be more beneficial, not only financially for them, but also for potential customers if food was available all day.",Date of stay: February 2018,"The Pheasant, Bassenthwaite",4,"Bassenthwaite, United Kingdom"
Dissatisfied,"Called in late Saturday afternoon whilst Christmas shopping in late December. On arrival there was plenty of empty tables. We wanted a glass of wine each to be told the restaurant did not serve wine by glass it was bottles only. As such we ordered a bottle of red with the meal , the starter meze was very good and tasty, however main course lamb chops in my opinion could have been better and were bland. The biggest shock came on paying the Bill as we were charged in excess of £34.00 for the wine!!!.There's a lesson to be learned here.which is always read the wine list prior to ordering.",Date of visit: December 2017,Cafe Istanbul,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Gets better ever time,"Having stayed at this fabulous hotel for the 3rd time this year, yet again it can't be faulted in any way. We had a waterside room overlooking the beck at the rear, which had a superb comfortable large bed. The langdale is first class in every way, very quiet and relaxing , the food in the stove restaurant is excellent and the staff and service is extremely good too. Not forgetting the Wainwrights Inn about 5 mins walk from the hotel which is cosy with an open fire and serves good food , but in my opinion the drinks are on the expensive side. Access to the spa and leisure facilities are great and just what is needed after a day on the fells. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and will certainly be back again.",Date of stay: November 2017,Langdale Hotel,4,"Ambleside, United Kingdom"
Very enjoyable,"Spent 2 nights at this lovely hotel. It is in a superb very peaceful location, the room was lovely and clean with an extremely comfortable bed. The breakfast was exceptional with plenty of choice. Evening meal was equally as good. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to family and friends and would certainly choose it again.",Date of stay: August 2017,The Eltermere Inn,4,"Elterwater, United Kingdom"
Excellent In Every Way.,"We stayed at the Langdale Hotel and Spa for 1 night as a birthday treat. I booked a signature room which in my opinion was excellent, a super kingsize comfortable bed with beautiful quality linens. The room did not have a balcony or significant views but it more than made up for the lack of these things. The breakfast next morning was delicious too with so much choice. Finally, my partner and I spent a lot of time in the spa which was also excellent, and extremely relaxing. The best part of it was that on the day of checking out the facilities can still be used which is a real benefit. I could not fault this hotel and its facilities and staff also, so much so I will be returning again in the next few weeks. !!",Date of experience: June 2017,Brimstone Spa,4,"Ambleside, United Kingdom"
Really good,"We stayed for 1 night as it is close to Grassington for the Dickensian market. The location is beautiful with stunning views. The food in the restaurant wa good and plenty of choice for breakfast. The staff and service was also good. Our room was lovely and clean overlooking the front of the hotel. If I have one criticism is is that the heating was on all night which made it difficult to sleep, in addition as the room was over the bar area, noise could be heard until approx 1.00 am. The hotel is not what I would consider cheap either but all in all I would recommend it and would certainly return. It is probably beneficial to choose a room on a higher floor or at the back of the building.",Date of stay: December 2016,The Devonshire Fell Hotel,4,"Burnsall, United Kingdom"
Can't fault it in any way !!,"As a repeat visitor to this fabulous hotel, that in itself says it all. I spent another 9 nights here from the middle to end of Sept. Again, the place is faultless. Exceptionally clean, excellent service and really nice welcoming staff. The rooms are bright, large comfortable beds and the whole place is kept spotless. Breakfast is plentiful. Σε ευχαριστώ πολύ για όλα",Date of stay: September 2016,Bourtzi Hotel,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Impromptu Stop off,"We called into this pub late in the afternoon for food after touring the dales for a day out. On first impressions, the room was dark and the whole place was tired looking in need of modernizing and/or brightening up. We ordered food which we didn't have to wait to long for and it was nice enough served really hot but they had quite a basic menu with the food written on a blackboard. There is a large log burner in the main lounge where we ate which was really nice and welcoming. We weren't hugely impressed on the whole but the food being served saved the day. !!",Date of stay: October 2016,The Golden Lion Hotel,4,"Horton-in-Ribblesdale, United Kingdom"
Repeat Visitor,"I have visited this place several times when out for the day on a tour of the Forest of Bowland as Sawley is right on the edge of it and provides easy access to other villages.
The pub/hotel is excellent in every way, very smart inside and comfortable, in a lovely location with really nice views across to Pendle Hill. I have not eaten here just had coffee but the service is really good too. Having visited on a weekday once with a friend it was really nice and quiet in comparison to the Sunday lunch rush at the weekend. However, I would not hesitate to recommend this place.",Date of stay: October 2016,The Spread Eagle Hotel,4,"Sawley, United Kingdom"
Excellent in every way.,"My partner and I chose to eat here as he wanted a pasta dish. I was aware that owner is Italian and as such it must be authentic. All I can say is we were not disappointed. Both dishes we chose were exceptional along with the service and hospitality of the staff. The restaurant is in a beautiful location too with stunning views across the old port of Skiathos. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place if you like pasta, although there are other dishes just as good on the menu, and it's one to return to.",Date of visit: September 2016,Lo&La,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Not the best experience.,"This taverna is in a lovely setting in the middle of the town with live bouzouki music , this being the main reason we chose to eat here. Sadly the food did not live up to the ambience and location. We chose a shrimp saganaki along with several other Greek plates which we like to eat altogether. The saganaki arrived and had a dark brown coloured sauce, considering it is supposed to be tomato based it didn't look right , and moreso didn't smell,fresh and certainly didn't taste too good. Needless to say we didn't eat it and proceeded to feed the shrimp to the local cats around the table. The couple on the table behind had ordered fish which also smelled awful. I have no idea if they ate it. I have eaten this dish at other traditional tavernas on the island and it has been delicious.Maybe this was just a one off but I based on this experience I would not return to eat here.",Date of visit: September 2016,Taverna Alexandros,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Slow Service,"Having been a regular visitor to Nostos Beach for several years, I prefer the old traditional taverna before the renovation that has been done here. There are pros and cons to this new place. The pros being that the sun loungers on the beach are now free. The cons are the menu is limited and service I found to be extremely slow. Waiting 45 minutes for food. In addition it is more expensive than the previous taverna.",Date of visit: September 2016,Salty Bone,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Excelllent,Stayed here for 1 night as was visiting Esher for a party. The room was beautiful with a super king size comfortable bed. It was very clean and looks newly renovated with air conditioning in the room which was a real bonus on a hot weekend. Breakfast was included in our stay which was also extremely good with lots of choice. The staff were very courteous and service good too. It's in a nice quiet location too approx 5 mins (if that) from the station with easy access to London Waterloo. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place and I only wish we could have stayed longer. !!,Date of stay: August 2016,The Foley,4,"Claygate, United Kingdom"
Perfection,"We ate at this lovely taverna twice during a week stay in Parga. I was enchanted by the beautiful setting once inside surrounded by citrus trees. The food and service was excellent, and having chosen 5 or 6 different starters from the hot and cold selection in effect to have a meze it was delicious and inexpensive. I would certainly return to this taverna if I went to Parga again and highly recommend it.",Date of visit: June 2016,Perivoli Restaurant,4,"Parga, Greece"
Faultless,We've just returned from a week at this beautiful hotel. On arrival we were escorted to the bar area via the stunning reception for a welcome drink. The room we were given on the top floor was excellent. The whole place is immaculate and clean with modern fittings and quality fixtures. Breakfast was also delicious with a plentiful choice. The staff and service are also really good and they will do anything for you. The hotel is really quiet and comfortable and we didn't hear our neighbours at all during our stay. The olive tree restaurant within the hotel serves quality food presented very nicely. It's about 15 mins walk down to Parga town but there is a courtesy bus if you prefer not to walk. On checkout of our room at midday and having a late evening flight we were able to use a shower room in the basement of reception which was most convenient . The decor and style of the whole place stunning and I can't recommend it highly enough on any visit to Parga.,Date of stay: June 2016,Adam's Hotel,4,"Parga, Greece"
Memorable for all the right reasons,"Having climbed the 130 steps from the beach to this taverna the view is unforgettable. The food we ordered came quickly and was absolutely amazing, fresh and delicious. The Greek lady Elena was really friendly and welcoming..... The setting is beautiful amongst bougainvillea . Sarakiniko was by far the nicest beach in the Parga area and visiting this taverna with its stunning vista and food made our visit even more special. The climb up is well worth it.",Date of visit: June 2016,Agali Restaurant,4,"Parga, Greece"
Exceptional,"Just returned from a 2 night stay in The duckhouse. I only wish it couldve been longer. Everything is superb the cleanliness, comfort and views are first class. Surrounding area is full of beautiful wildlife and waking up to see the deer roaming locally. It goes without saying that this is a ""must"" on your Shropshire accommodation list. Is also in close proximity to picturesque Ludlow. I can't wait to go back.:-)",Date of stay: April 2016,The Bringewood,4,"Burrington, United Kingdom"
Excellent cocktails,A great choice of cocktails each one was delicious. A nice atmosphere with comfortable seating. Would definitely recommend.,Date of visit: March 2016,All Bar One,4,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
Recommended,"I am a regular to the island of Skiathos but this was my first time to stay at this hotel. On arrival we were greeted with a welcome drink at the bar and our luggage taken up to our room which was excellent. A large comfortable bed and we found the room to be really quiet at all times which is a positive. The facilties at the hotel are excellent too, large comfortable sun beds around the large swimming pool area. The food in the restaurant was really good but I thought a little on the expensive side in comparison to greek tavernas. The buffet breakfast was superb with lots of choice on offer. The staff were very polite and service was good too. There are 2 negative points I would raise, the first being that the air conditioning is centrally controlled and you have to phone reception to turn it on/off. Also, it was evident that people are placing their beach towels on the sunbeds early in the morning to reserve them and then returning to their rooms or for breakfast. We feel that the hotel should adopt a policy whereby notices should be displayed in order for ALL guests to enjoy the pool area. Enough said. !! The location of the hotel is little more than 10 mins walk to the main shopping street port areas. All in all I would recommend this hotel and would certainly return.",Date of stay: August 2015,La Piscine Art Hotel,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Beautiful Location,I have visited this taverna many times and I love to walk up to it. Its in a residential location with a beautiful view. The food is good and its never to busy. You can walk back down to Skiathos via the path that takes you down by the airport. ! All in all a lovely family run place well worth a visit,Date of visit: September 2014,Mega Gialos,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Exceptional in every way.,We have just returned from a weekend spent at this beautiful house. On arrival we were welcomed by Sarah the owner and showed to our room which I must say was superb. The views from the property are also awesome. The place is individually styled with quality fixtures and decor. it's beautifully peaceful and a really nice breakfast is served and provision made for anything you want. This is a must visit place on your yorkshire dales itinerary and we can't wait to return. Sarah is also the perfect hostess.,Date of stay: May 2015,Stow House,4,"Aysgarth, United Kingdom"
Excellent Food,We ate in here on both nights of our weekend visit as the food was so good. I would say it is more like restaurant standard than a pub serving meals. The decor in the place is a little tired and dated and could probably do with a makeover but dont let that deter you from eating heree. You will not be dissapointed and the service is excellent too.,Date of visit: May 2015,The George and Dragon Inn Restaurant,4,"Aysgarth, United Kingdom"
Lovely Home Made Cakes,Called in for a Coffee and cake on our weekend visit. Served lovely home made cakes and biscuits. A Traditional little place in a nice setting. Well worth a visit.,Date of visit: May 2015,Mill Race Teashop,4,"Aysgarth, United Kingdom"
Amazing Location,We visited the Inn whilst staying in Aysgarth for a long weekend. I have to say the location is superb at the top of the world and stunning views . We chose not to dine at the pub because on entering the room was filled with smoke from the open fire in the lounge area. It appears they may have a problem with their flue outlet or at least needs a chimney sweep. !! The whole of the buidling was so smoke filled and uncomfortable they had to open windows to let it escape. A very traditional place in a superb location. A real gem of a tourist attraction,Date of visit: May 2015,Tan Hill Inn,4,"Low Row, United Kingdom"
Excellent,Just returned from 1 night stay at this lovely country pub. We stayed in the kingsize room which was large and very comfortable. The village is very quiet and peaceful. We chose to eat in the restaurant at night and as it was Easter weekend was advised to book a table. We weren't disappointed at all with the food. It was delicious with lovely presentation. An excellent breakfast was provided the following morning with a choice. All in all a lovely experience and I would definitely stay again.,Date of stay: April 2015,The Foresters Arms,4,"Carlton, United Kingdom"
Not what I expected,"We chose to eat here as staying locally for a long weekend.The pub looks better from the outside than in and It doesn't have the expected country feeling on entry. The menu of home cooked food was not extensive and in my opinion the quality was average served on cold plates making the food cold before finishing eating. It's the little things that make the difference. Having said that the staff are friendly and welcoming. There's also an open fire in the bar area which was barely lit. Overall, a lovely area with a village pub in need of a bit of TLC.",Date of stay: February 2015,Fox & Hounds Inn,4,"West Burton, United Kingdom"
Another perfect stay,Having just returned from this hotel after the 2nd visit yet again I can't recommend it highly enough. We booked one of the superior rooms and was shown to the 2nd floor the room had a super kingsize 4 poster bed. It was beautiful. The staff are brilliant and can't do enough for you. The breakfast is plentiful with lots of choice. The hotel is very smart and in a great location in the town despite this it's extremely quiet. Free wifi and beach towels every day. What more could you want.,Date of stay: September 2014,Bourtzi Hotel,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Home from Home,Just returned from my second visit having stayed in Maple cottage. It's very clean extremely warm and cosy and peaceful. Very close to the village and there is plenty do do in the area if you like the outdoors. I would certainly recommend the accommodation. If there is one thing I would like even more which is far from a criticism I think the property would benefit further from nice king size beds as opposed to standard doubles. But will certainly be back.,Date of stay: February 2014,Beechtree Cottages,4,"Ingleton, United Kingdom"
Superb Hotel,"I returned on Friday 21 June from a 10 night stay at this hotel, and wish to share my experience. My partner and I found the hotel faultless, we booked one of the deluxe rooms with a pool view, on arrival at the hotel we were shown to the room by Dimitris who stated they had a very nice room for us, he wasn't wrong. It was excellent. A very large comfortable bed, the décor was beautiful and spotlessly clean. Toiletries provided and renewed daily, bathroom slippers, and clean linen and towels daily. The breakfast is a buffet and has an endless choice. We were also struck by the décor throughout the hotel, it has been designed in a very contemporary way. It is situated in a small street in the town but despite this is very quiet. The 2 brothers that run the hotel are extremely hospitable and friendly and there is also a cocktail bar which again stood out for it's décor and quality of service. I have spent so much time in Skiathos over the years and I would go so far as to say I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else on future visits. I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody.",Date of stay: June 2013,Bourtzi Hotel,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Garden Restaurant,Lovely tranquil setting with contemporary furniture. Excellent food and special treatment as it was my birthday when we ate there.,Date of visit: June 2013,O Paraxenos,4,"Skiathos, Greece"
Comfortable Weekend,"I have just spent the weekend at this lovely B & B. It can't be faulted, the location is excellent in central Ambleside, walking to pubs/restaurants and even walks from the door. We stayed in a lovely deluxe Room at the front of the property, it is spotlessly clean and the bed was comfortable too. There is a plentiful choice for breakfast. The hosts Sarah and David are very welcoming and look after you really well. I would recommend it to anybody, you won't be dissapointed and look forward to staying again in the near future. Thank you.",Date of stay: January 2013,Easedale Lodge,4,"Ambleside, United Kingdom"
Worth a Visit,"Enjoyed a lovely meal here on Saturday evening with my partner and some friends. We didn't have to reserve a table either which was great on a busy Saturday in the lakes. We arrived approx 8.30pm and only had to wait about 10 mins if that for the table. When the food came it was delicious. I wouldn't say there is a huge menu to choose from but all 4 of us had something different and each enjoyed it equally. Nice atmosphere, only a small place and well worth a visit. I would however have like to see some cocktails on the drinks list, but they aren't available. Oh well, can't have everything, but it certainly didn't spoil it. I would certainly recommend this place.",Date of visit: August 2012,Dodds Restaurant,4,"Ambleside, United Kingdom"
Very happy for a week.,"Myself and my partner booked into this hotel on spec. We had previously booked an apartment in Taormina which turned out to be what I can only describe as a ""dungeon"", hence the reason to move on. On arrival we needed a room for 6 nights and asked to be away from the road at the front. We were given the key to look at a room on the second floor at the back of the main building. It was very clean, nicely furnished, a good size and quite a large 4 piece bathroom. Needless to say we accepted immediately.
We couldn't have been happier, the bed linen changed daily along with towels. A safe provided in the room and the hotel is opposite the main beach in taormina mare, which is down more than 80 steps. !!!. We had bed/breakfast, which was also good, the usual continental style buffet but good choice. We also had dinner in the restaurant attached to the hotel, which served excellent food and extremely nice cakes. The staff are also friendly and helpful.
All in all I would stay at the Villa Bianca again if I ever returned to Taormina, and would recommend it.",Date of stay: June 2012,Villa Bianca Resort,4,"Sicily, Italy"
Traditional Town.,Beautiful Shops and restaurants. Very traditional. A fantastic view of Mt. Etna from the main square.,Date of experience: June 2012,Corso Umberto,4,"Sicily, Italy"
