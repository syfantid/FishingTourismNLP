Best Day Ever,"Spent the day cruising the AMAZING water that surrounds Poros, a gem of an island with the WONDERFUL Tasos! Fishing, swimming, dining, and sightseeing are some of the activities that made this a GREAT trip, but the MEMORIES that were made that day are not to be missed!! Our day there has long passed but the memories are thought of fondly and often. So, if you and your spouse or family have the opportunity to book this adventure I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! A day with Tasos on the sea is most definitely a PERFECT day in a not so perfect world.",Date of experience: August 2019,Fishing Trips Poros,1,"Poros, Greece"
Owner is terrible,Average food and owner is less than stellar to his employees. Don’t waste your money. Was seated at the counter and watched as he publicly corrected a new employee while stopping her shake making progress. He left her in tears and ruined my appetite. #kindnessrules,Date of experience: September 2019,Goolrick's Pharmacy,1,"Fredericksburg, Virginia"
Best Dive Shop on EARTH!!,"Best Dive Shop on EARTH!!
I have an EXTREME fear/dislike of FISH!! I won’t eat or touch them. I’m more of a pool person as I feet the ocean is really rough, my peeps come from SoCal. When we came to Curaçao B Dive at Cas Abou was told to be the don’t miss dive shop and beach, they were SPOT ON!!! I started with a discovery dive and a few weeks later I am now a PADI CERTIFIED Advanced open water diver! The best part was all the new friends I made who dive!! B and her crew Are the BEST divers and know their reef well, so don’t miss a guided dive for the amazing creatures that live just off shore!!! I still don’t want to eat or touch fish but knowing how it feels to swim with them in calm waters of Cas Abou beach is an awesome thing!! So from beginner to expert, or even for the beach bum there is something for everyone at B Diving & Watersports!!!!",Date of experience: May 2019,B Diving & Watersports,1,Curaçao

Magic Hands,"Never have I experienced such an incredible service! She took the time to evaluate all the aches and pains and developed a massage that fit the issues of the tissues!

The food that never came,Waited over an hour at 2 pm (not the rush hour) for a hamburger that never came til we walked out. Never got a refill on our water and asked for a second piece of bread. There were 4 tables including ours. The waitress said they were really busy... it was a burger! Do yourself a favor save your money and go ELSEWHERE!,Date of visit: January 2019,Dal Toro,1,Curaçao

This place is a don’t miss!!,You won’t find any fresher fish that here!! Dad is out catching them and mommas in the kitchen cooking them up and it’s all served by their really great children and extended family!
