Quaint restaurant,Food was well prepared and presented and delicious. The staff were really friendly and attentive. A great restaurant with delicious food. Well worth a visit.,Date of visit: September 2019,The Rising Sun,1,"London, United Kingdom"
Excellent location,"A nice hotel, ideally situated. The rooms are spacious ( we had a room on 3rd floor ) and clean, staff are friendly and helpful. The pool is a tad small and a bit of a scrum for the very few sunbeds but with the beach literally across the road, it’s not really an issue)",Date of stay: July 2019,Ibiscus Hotel,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Hidden gem,"Stumbled on this restaurant while site seeing, and decided to give it a try tonight. Wow. What a find. The food was excellent, and that is high praise from a girl whose mums food is the best Cypriot food you’ll get! We had the zucchini fritters, aubergine and tzatziki to start and kleftico for main. In truth, we ordered too much, as the helpings were very generous. The restaurant itself is very quaint and exactly what a good old fashioned family restaurant should be. Thoroughly recommend it.",Date of visit: July 2019,Niohori Restaurant,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Mediocre at best,"The setting is beautiful and entertainment on Friday night was good, but that’s as good as it gets. Waited a while until we we served, and when the food came, my pork souvlaki was cold and my friends spaghetti was dry. They replaced the souvlaki, which was only slightly warmer than the first one but this was undercooked and not good at all. Go for a drink but look elsewhere for food.",Date of visit: July 2019,Auvergne Cafe,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Fishing with Captain Manolis,"Booked this as my partner loves fishing, but I don’t but said would give it a go. I absolutely loved it. Captain Mihalis was so patient, knowledgeable, had your safety at the forefront of his thoughts, and made this experience truly memorable. We had about 3 hours of fishing then some time for swimming while Mihalis bbq’d the fish for us. He served this up with a delicious Greek salad and Greek bread. If you want a few hours of fun and a great meal to boot, I recommend this trip!",Date of experience: July 2019,Captain Manolis Fishing Trips in Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Excellent customer service,"My partner brought his old passport and we only realised when we went to check in. The lady at the desk was extremely helpful and all along while we arranged for the new passport to be brought to us, all the staff at Jet2.com bent over backwards to help. I cannot sing the their praises high enough, and would definitely recommend flying with them.",Date of travel: July 2019,Jet2.com,1,World
Disappointing,"Our booking was for 14:00 on a Sunday afternoon. We arrived and shown to our table. We were then told that we would have to vacate the table after 2 hrs as they needed to clean the floor! We were then given menus and advised that 2 of the 3 roasts were unavailable. When we ordered steak, again we were advised that we needed to order the steak to be medium rare as any other way of cooking it would make it chewy! When our steaks arrived, despite ordering it well done, it came black on the outside and red raw on the inside.
Having said all of that, the staff were magnificent, food that was available was excellent, other than the steak. Chips, that are proper potato chips, not frozen. Deserts, and cocktails very good, so I will definitely give it another go, but perhaps book an earlier slot!!",Date of visit: January 2017,Holborn Dining Room,1,"London, United Kingdom"
