Simple the Best.,You will never have chinese food this good anywhere else. The menu is small and perfectly formed. I cann express how good it is. Family run this is not a cheep take away but real home cooking.,Date of visit: December 2020,Hei Hing Cafe & Noodle Bar,1,"Isleworth, United Kingdom"
Disappearing recommendation,"My mum has eaten here several times and always said how good it was so when she wanted a takeaway pizza we ordered from Sizlers. Well we were both disappointed and mum mum embarrassed. The garlic bread was burned and bland, the pizza came with very little topping or sauce base and the olives were cheep and tasteless. My lamb shank was ok but nothing special and not worth the price. Sad as I will not order again and I doubt my mum will go again",Date of visit: December 2020,Sizlers,1,"Isleworth, United Kingdom"
Special birthday meal,Friends took me to The white Horse for a special birthday meal and this place didn't disappoint. It's a really lovely country pub with a bar on one side and a dining room on the other. Very nice ambience and friendly staff. We were all blown away by the great food. Top quality and at a very reasonable price. Staff were friendly and attentive. Very happy to meet the friendly pub dog. I always appreciate a dog friendly environment. I couldn't recommend this little gem in the forest more.,Date of visit: September 2020,The White Horse Inn,1,"Staunton, United Kingdom"
Beautiful bar full of music and joy,"It takes a lot for me to want to come back to one particular bar when there are so many places on offer in old Rhodes Town. The facts that we have come back 4 times in 3 days says so much about this beautiful place. This wonderful bar restaurant takes over the entire of a cobbled alleyway and has been very cleverly decked out to make the most of the natural features. White chairs, tables and canopies with fairy lights work beautifully with the cobblestones and the wonderfully natural pink petals that fall from the vines above create a peaceful atmosphere my most it that a lot of Greeks come here, weather local or from other islands. There is always live music with a tall guy who sings amazingly who is accompanied by a guitar and a pianist. Of course there is the usual traditional music but then pop songs from the area and everybody sings along and soon the street is filled the dancing and joy. On several occasions we have joined in with the party, it almost feels like you have joined in with a wedding or fiesta. It's just a very fun place to be. The family work so hard to provide a good service and although some of the reviews may think that they don't work hard we have watched them. my partner and I are both in hospitality, we know how hard it be on a busy night. This family work hard and care about there customers. Come and drink and dance and be merry.",Date of visit: October 2019,Meze-Bar Stou Apostoli,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
We found it worth the stop,Despite some mixed reviews that we saw after we had a pleasant enough time at this no doubt slightly touristy restaurant. we needed a bit of a rest between museum but we decided to just not worry and stop here.It's an attractive space under the canopy of a tree with well presented tables.the staff were pleasant enough and when the food arrived I was very happy with what we got. We ordered the platter of dips and bread (we had to order more bread as not enough for 2) What we got was delicious enough. We also tried the traditional homemade sausage which is absolutely delicious. This is definitely one of the better touristy spots that we went to. There was no pictures of the food out just a well-designed menu.Despite some of the other reviews who said the service was bad we found it absolutely fine. I would suspect that if anybody has problems with service here it was during the peak of season or at the end of a very long hardly 6-months of tourist season. What we got was fresh food well prepared and at reasonable price considering the location.,Date of visit: October 2019,Golden Olympiade Peridis Restaurant,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Budget romance with a very hospital owner,"If you're a couple travelling on a budget and you want a little bit of romance in your life then this is the place to go.just out of sight of the main tourist trap you will find a wonderful little courtyard decked out with nice tables and beautiful fairy lighting.this restaurant is a specialist in local season and has an unusual dishes like the Viagra she'll fish dish which is apparently better than the pill or sea urchin.but don't worry if you want to just simple good seafood this is the place to come.the owner is a very chatty man he knows how to look after his customers. Everything is prepared freshly by the family and the quality is superb.I can't believe we had a three course meal and drinks for under â‚¬50 for the 2 of us.I had the grilled aubergine and calamari which was the best I've ever had while my partner had muscles in an incredibly garlicky sauce. We will looked after well, never rushed the service was wonderful and the entire atmosphere was relaxing and romantic. The food was sublime and definitely worth trying during your visit to Rhodes.",Date of visit: October 2019,Nireas,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Superfresh and simply prepared,"If your looking for fresh fish in Rhodes and you want to stay away from the tourist market then this is the place to come. Family run and known for the quality of their fish this small outdoor Cafe restaurant has a charm of its own. The menu is essentially exclusively seafood and veg, the dishes are simply and lovingly prepared so the flavour comes through rather than being covered with too much sauce or spice. The food is grilled on an outside grill where you can watch the mama prepare it and the prices are incredibly reasonable. We had two courses each and drinks and it only came to under â‚¬40.we were also lucky enough to get the taste of free dessert that was too absolutely die for, a simple yoghurt topped with cinnamon and honey and a ""secret,"" ingredient. If you want to not have anything that involves chips pizza or pasta and you want to spend a lot this is the place to come to get the taste of a real simple quick meals. Absolutely recommend",Date of visit: October 2019,Pizanias Kyriakos The Sea Star,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
Wondering day on the sea.,"I cannot recommend this trip enough. Half day out on the sea was only â‚¬35. You got so much for your money. A peaceful journey around the coast on a small fishing vessel with complimentary beer and wine or soft drinks to get you in a relaxed mood then a good hour or so of fishing which was very easy so don't be put off if you've never had any experience. And to top it off the fish you catch is cooked for you and presented beautifully with bread and salad. You can't get better than catching and eating your own fish. while this is being prepared for you you can jump over board and have the swim in the beautiful clear sea and there are snorkels and masks provided so you can get a real view of what is down under the waves. The crew were lovely locals, funny and charming in their own down to earth way. This is a wonderful trip for anyone who wants to stay away from the larger commercial trips. Real food, real people in a beautiful surrounding.we went today and now we are even discussing going again before we go home. This is a kind of trip that wonderful memories make. We would like to thank the crew for giving us such a great day out.",Date of experience: October 2019,Makarounas Fishing Trip Rhodes,1,"Rhodes, Greece"
NOT vegetarian friendly,"So unbelievably disappointed with this so called vegetarian friendly restaurant. Although there are vegetarian and vegan options on the main menu the Christmas Menu offered NO veg starter and NO veg main!! But apparently I can eat all thee deserts. How could the upper management have let this happen? ? I mean what the ""fork""??

Basically there is no Christmas menu for non meat eaters. Someone has really screwed up here when there is really no excuse. I am very disappointed and will not be recommending the company as a whole. ( check out the photos )",Date of visit: November 2018,Busaba Kingston Riverside,1,"Kingston upon Thames, United Kingdom"
Heligan beats Eden 100 x overðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ,"Just to get this straight I did not enjoy The Eden Project ( you can't tell that in my review ) but even if I had enjoyed it The Lost Gardens of Heligan would still win hands down.

This realy is a playground for the imagination, a wonderland of natural and a darn good family attraction.

To start it's a very resalable price, considerably cheeper than Eden and we got good discount from our holiday let so don't forget to ask or look out for vouchers.

If you go in the morning try one of there amazing cooked breakfasts for only Â£6. It was truly the best fry up I've ever had!

Unlike Eden, Heligan has everything. Leafy woodland walks, formal gardens, mysterious jungles and babbling brooks.

During the summer this year they ran Lost Summer, we're they provided teepee making equipment were parents and kids could build their own dens. This encouraged outdoor play and imagination and there was a lot of happy families playing together in the field as we passed.

There is also a theatre show going on as well as talks and walks.

I absolutely loves seeing there farm animals and kitchen gardens. A fun and very cute way to see were your food comes from for kids.

It's so chilled her. Kids can be kids and run around and explore. I didn't here anyone of any age complain that they were board. There is a restaurant and a coffee shop and of course a gift shop but it's not rammed down your throat! There are no added extras you need to pay for unless you count the guide book.

I could have spent a whole day here, if only we had the time. We will be coming back as I don't think I could ever get bord of it and seeing the seasons change the plants will bring a new eliminate to every visit.

Things to remember.

Make a day of it, there is plenty to do.
Make sure you do the rope bridge.
Dogs are welcome on the lead in all areas.
The ice cream is amazing. ( try the rhubarb and caramel )
If the weather is a bit rainy take a mac but don't let the weather put you off. It's worth getting a little damp for.",Date of experience: September 2017,The Lost Gardens of Heligan,1,"Pentewan, United Kingdom"
Local and free.,"Sometimes the simple things are the best. This tiny room is home to local sea creatures. If you have no luck crabbing or catching anything with a rod just wander over to the aquarium and get a really close look at what you are missing.
It's surprising what lives in our costal waters and thay are often overlooked as they are not as glamorous as Nemo or Dory.
This is free so always donate as much as you can to keep this little place alive and swimming",Date of experience: September 2017,Mevagissey Aquarium,1,"Mevagissey, United Kingdom"
Cream of the crop.,"In an area of the country full of tea rooms and cakes shops it's sometimes hard to get truly excited. Then we went to Tea on The Quey.

It's in a prime spot, overlooking Mevagissey Harbour so while you sip your tea you can do some great people and boat watching.

All you need to do is grab a table and order at the counter. The hardest thing to do is choose which home made cake to have. There was two of us and neither of us could deside so we ended up sharing 3!! ( plum and almond cake, bread pudding and the most amazing chocolate brownie!) It was all brought over with a pot of tea by a very friendly and chatty waitress. I really liked the fact that she brought an extra tea bag for the pot incase we liked stronger tea.

It's a realy nice place to sit. Bright and clean with loads of info about where all there local ingredients come from.

I really enjoyed the time we spent hiding from the rain. The cakes were absolutely spot on.

FYI.
Dogs are welcome as long as they are well behaved.
There is free WiFi, just ask for the password.",Date of visit: August 2017,Tea on the Quay,1,"Mevagissey, United Kingdom"
Snug as a bug in the Pub,"""Yay! It's raining. Let's go to the pub!""

So we popped in to the Fountain.
It's exactly what you want in a pub in a small Cornish village.
Dark and warm, low beamed ceilings and local ales on tap.
I realy wish we had eaten there as the menu looked great but we had already eaten.
I would definitely recommend popping for a pint and a chat with the locals.

FYI
Dogs are welcome and there is free WiFi, although it's The Cloud and as usual it was a pain to log onto.",Date of visit: August 2017,The Fountain Inn,1,"Mevagissey, United Kingdom"
Very very odd little place ðŸ˜•,"Sooooo. ... how do I put this....

In all honesty I was having trouble writing this review as I worried about hurting the staffs feelings and then I read other people's and realised that I just need to tell the truth.

When we looked at the menu outside I was really excited. Trio of John Dory with mussels, Crabs Mornay, local scallops.
I was in like a shot. Oh foolish, foolish me.

Inside there was only 5 tables, 2 of which had people on them. We sat down in the widow and looked around at the blue a white room.

It really wasn't long before we started to feel a little uncomfortable. It was incredibly quite. No one was talking above a whisper and when the waitress came over things started to get realy weird. She was an older lady and at first I thought maybe she was just helping out as she seem to have no confidence in what she was doing, in fact she almost looked terrified. She took our drinks order with no welcome or eye contact. She also spoke so quietly that we could see why people were whispering. She was setting the tone and it felt more like being at a funeral that a restaurant.

Well we thought we would stay as the food sounded nice but I really wished we hadn't. It was so uncomfortable to talk in that hushed environment that myself and my partner ended up having a text conversation with each other rather than brake the silence. All there was in the background was some very quite and depressing classical music. Fingers and toes were crossed that the food would make up for it.

Oh bugger...

I'm really not saying the food was bad. It was fine but with a menu that included local scallops, Mediterranean fish stew (ordered ) and fillet of pollock you expect it to be something just a little bit special.

If I was to describe the food in one word I would say ""Padestrian ""

It was like your Nans basic version of a classic dish.

The fish stew tasted more like a shop bought soup base that had been seasoned and bulked out and the Crab Mornay was ok but really not that interesting or seasoned. It was kind of good quality canteen food, with old school side salad to match.

We sat there and ate as we watched people drift in and out. Families and couples alike soon fell silent after a minute or to after entering. The waitress continued to look like an undertaker, not even being able to join in with a joke when someone tried to talk to her.

We ate and left feeling deflated.

OK so here are some things to remember.. it was responsibly priced.
If you were taking an elderly relative who remembered rationing they would probably love it.
The coffee was fine.
And they let in dogs (quite ones)

At the beginning of this review I said I was worried about how to word this. But so many reviews have mentioned so many of the things I've brought up here that I know I'm not wrong in my opinion.
Don't just read this review, read the others too. I wish the owner, chef and waitress would!
Take a look at the pictures of the info they put up in there window about fresh cooking and there chefs training . It sounds almost defensive, like they won't take constructive criticism.

I wish they would listen. I hate to see any local independent company fail. I can't see this place lasting much longer if it dosent improve.",Date of visit: August 2017,Blue,1,"Mevagissey, United Kingdom"
Good take away.,Just had tasty fish and chips take away from The Wagon Wheel. Portion size was good and the battery was very nice. Although we didn't sit in you can do if you wish and the interior is nicer than you average chippie. One think to keep in mined ( for us city types on holiday) is that it closes earlier than you may expect. (8:30pm) If your planning a fish supper in your holiday cottage don't leave it to late!,Date of visit: August 2017,The Wagon Wheel,1,"St Austell, United Kingdom"
Great pit stop pub.,"So I made the mistake in agreeing to take bicycles on holiday to hilly Cornwall. Thank god for the Polgooth Inn. We stopped off for a refreshing drink on the way there AND back. In truth I would have stayed there all day. It has a wonderful outdoor area looking over the small valley with there impressive kitchen garden at the bottom. Altogeth it was a bank holiday and busy it had a very calm and relaxing feel to it. We had our little Jack Russell with us and it was very dog friendly both inside and out ( not in the dining room of course ) Talking of the dining room it looks amazing and the food that was going past was making my mouth water! The menu looked good, lots of local or home grown produce. I would love to have stayed and tried some. I would recommend popping in even if it's just for a pint or a coffee in the sun. Well done on a brilliant hidden gem.",Date of visit: August 2017,Polgooth Inn,1,"Polgooth, United Kingdom"
Cream Tea Joy,"We were taken to the Lakeside Cafe by a local who has been telling us about it for ages, and I can see why! Right up by a old school boating lake ( I didn't think the even existed any more ) is this fab little cafe. We sat outside on there veranda and watch the ducks and rowing boats flotation by while we enjoyed a home made cream Tea. There was a VERY generous helping of cream and jam for our warm scone ( we could use it all) and the coffee and teas were just what we needed to start the day. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend any visitors to pop in for a bit here.",Date of visit: August 2017,Lakeside Cafe,1,"Newquay, United Kingdom"
Not as good as expected,"I want to start by saying that The Eden Project is a fantastic endeavour. It's wonderful that they took what was essentially a barron wasteland and tuned it into a lush and groundbreaking garden. The biodomes are spectacular, especially on a sunny day and the facilities are great. Disabled access, some dog friendly areas ( not the domes) and nice staff.

But...

The reality of going there can be a little disappointing.

We went today, in the last week of the school holidays. We specifically didn't go on the bank holiday weekend knowing it would be busy but it was still packed.
Expect a long wait to get tickets, to get gift add as they are a charity you have to give ALL your details which of course takes time. When you are in its a beautiful view as you walk around towards the biodomes but it's all walkways surrounded by plants with no larger open spaces. Add families, pushchairs, screaming children and grumpy teenagers and it's not so relaxing as you may expect. I quickly got fed up with the very commercial feel of the place. There are cafes, ice cream stalls and gift shops everywhere. We queued up for 20 mins for a very small coffee and 35 mins for an ice cream. What really sealed the commercial thing for me was being forsted to exit via the gift shop. Banksy eat your heart out.

The biodomes are an absolute wonder of engendering but when u get inside you won't find much more than you would at Kew Gardens with is cheeper. The jungle one is fun but the Mediterranean dome is not very exciting (""oh look another cafe"")

I'm an avid gardener and also have kids ( though it was just the 2 of us this time) and I would always encourage kids to explore the national world but I know that after they have seen one parm tree they have seen them all and quickly get bord. I was hoping for more interactive education or something more hands on but it was more like filing along behind hyper kids who were being dragged around by increasing grumpy parents.

Being the fact that The Eden project is know for being environmental friendly I was shocked that the rum bar in one of the biodomes was putting drinks in plastic glasses. The bin by it was full of them ( please see photos ) Although the cafe seemed to have thought about how much wastage they made I think there is still much room for improvement.

So...

What I would recommend is never going in the summer holidays unless you really can't help it. Check all your ticket options as there are discounts available (Â£25-30 per adult ) and if you want to avoid spending even more money take a packed lunch and this also cuts down on the waiting in long and boring lines.
Expect a nice day out but it's not going to change your life and there are many other places I would choose.",Date of experience: August 2017,Eden Project,1,"Bodelva, United Kingdom"
Lovely lunch.,"Cote as a brand is very good. Not exactly fine dining but definitely at the top of the high street chains such as Jamie's or Carluccio's. With that in mined you should be confident that you will get a high standard of both food and service. And we did. It's a lovely spot down by the river and I would always recommend sitting outside if the weather allows. ( not just because of of the view but also because the restaurant can be very noisy inside.

The food was lovely and well presented
There is always something for everyone and although it doesn't appear that the menu changes very often they do cater for the slightly more adventurous dinner like myself. I had the fish soup for starters and then stake tartare. It was all very good and tasty but some of the other guests felt it was lacking a little. Nothing major just missing a little bit of passion from the kitchen. ( well that's what always happens when u go to lunch with two professional chiefs and there families, everyone's a bloody critic lol)

The service was very good if a little bit to formal. There was was no real connection with the first waiter but at the end of the meal we had a chat and a joke with a lovely waitresses over some kids coloring in.

Cote is great for family gatherings , especially if there are NO children. It's nice to be in an adult environment for a nice grown up meal.

All in all I would recommend Cote. It's something a little special that won't cost an arm and a leg, the food is always good and the environment is upmarket.

But... I would loved to have had a soup spoon not a dessert spoon with my soup, another guests who had the fish stew was surprised to not get a finger bowl and I was a little disappointed after asking for the stake tartare to be a mains size to get the starter size instead. Non of this would stop me coming again but would be nice if it didn't happen again.",Date of visit: July 2017,Cote Brasserie - Kingston,1,"Kingston upon Thames, United Kingdom"
Disappointing after being recommended,"I'm sorry to say this was not as good as I was led to believe. We came as a family and at first it seemed nice. Good environment and nice waitresses. The kids pizzas we ordered first and seemed nice and a very good size but unfortunately the meals for the adults that were not pizzas were very disappointing. One person ordered the carbonara as from the menu it looked like it was going to be the real thing, made with egg rather than cream or cheese but when it arrived it was white and sloppy and very salty. I ordered the veal with was every more salty. I love salt and often added more but this was WAY to much. The dish was supposed to come with rosemary potatoes, what I got was obviously frozen potato wedges. ( see photo) and not a hit of rosemary. When you spend Â£14 I don't expect to get Iceland frozen wedges. We also order a coke for someone who joined us and a can of coke was plocked on the table with a glass. No ice, no lemon, no nothing. As it was a family gathering and we had kids and one or to of the adults were a little merry we did not say anything ( not that we had the opposite no one came to check back on us) but I will not returning or recommending this place as I felt very cheated by a substandard meal. It's a real shame. ",Date of visit: July 2017,Stone Pizza,1,"Kingston upon Thames, United Kingdom"
Disappointing takeaway / delivery,"We had been meaning to try this restaurant for a while as we had heard such good things about it, and had a personal recommendations from people who we trusted. But we wanted a night in rather than a meal out so we ordered a delivery. The menu looked amazing and I was very excited but when it arrived it was so disappointed. The portion size was surprisingly small, some of the dishes were cold and the crispy beef was anything but crispy. I was expecting something special but what we go was average at best. It was boring and bland and it was not cheap but after mentioning this to the person who recommended it i was told that they are known for not being bothered with the take away side of the business and that we should have eaten at the restaurant for a good meal. WTF? How can this be? Good food in the restaurant but bad take away?? I was so disappointed. My partner wants to eat in so we can compare but I'm not sure if I can be bothered after my first experience.",Date of visit: May 2017,Imperial China Restaurant,1,"Teddington, United Kingdom"
The best curry in the area,"We have been enjoying the food from Cinnamon Lounge for several years now, both eating in and take away and it has never been less than brilliant. Resently we have moved a few miles away and thought it would be to fare away to deliver but we were so happy that they do come out to Whitton.

The food is always amazing. The chicken 65 starter is to die for! Unlike most places the chicken tikka Masala is not bland and boring but rich, flavoursome and has a spicy kick. The menu never disappoints and has a good range of dishes , both familiar and new.

We are so happy we can still get the food from here. It's the best for miles around",Date of visit: July 2017,Cinnamon Lounge,1,"Isleworth, United Kingdom"
Beautiful threatre,This is such a beautiful threatre. The atmosphere is always great here and it always has excellent quality shows on. This dose mean that booking in advance is always advisable. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Of course the bar prices are expensive but this is the same for every theatre in the West End.

The best cafe in Teddington,"I love the French tart. We discovered it in the new year and now go regularly. There coffee is amazing. Every sip is bliss and there cakes are astonishing. And very responsibility priced! I took my mum as a early mother's day treat and we had the afternoon tea. It was absolutely wonderful. Real lose leaf tea in vintage cups, a selection of hot and cold nibbles, mini cakes and s cream tea. We couldn't eat it all so took some home.

Always great,"I have been coming to Taro on and off for 10 years and today introduced a friend to it. As always it was great.
Although there are plenty of places around the West End to get good Japanese food Taro doesn't charge you an arm and a leg for the privilege.
It's a simple affair, practice tables and chairs and an open kitchen. The menu is straight forward with helpful descriptions and a few pictures. You can choose from hearty fried noodles, bento boxes or fresh sushi ( plus many other options)

It's quick, it's simple, it's cheap and it's honest. I would always recommend this established restaurant",Date of visit: May 2017,Taro,1,"London, United Kingdom"
A beautiful walk,"This is such a beautiful spot. Walking along the well kept paths with the river and the trees is a great way to get away from the stress of everyday life.

Needs improvement,"We come to squire cafe several times a month for the last 8 months and always have coffee and often lunch. During this time we have been consistently frustrated by the cafe.
The service if friendly enough but it takes forever to get served. The staff are always slow and never pick up speed when a queue starts to form ( with is most of the time) I've often stood getting more frustrated as I watch the others being served so slowly that we have nearly walked out.
When u do finally get served the menu is really rather dull. Almost everything is based around bread. Sandwiches, flat bread, burgers, panini. It's all boring and really rather expensive. The menu hardly ever changes, if at all so after a while it's hard to find something you want to eat... again. Even the cakes that look great are cheaply made and a bit disappointing.
The environment is very nice accepted there are always dirty tables. It doesn't matter how busy or quite it is there will be multiple tables with dirty dishes left on them.
I work in the hospitality industry and everything I have mentioned above would not be allowed to happen in any other cafe or restaurant that wanted to succeed. The garden centre is great so I makes it even harder to understand why the cafe is allowed to plod on is such a dull way.
We have been staying less and less for coffee or food as it's just not pleasurable any more. I wish the manager would take a proper look at the running of the cafe as it's letting the whole centre down.",Date of visit: May 2017,Squire's Garden Centre,1,"Twickenham, United Kingdom"
A proper pub,"In these days of chain pubs and and crappy company's like Greene King standardising everything it's great to find a pub that has real charm. This pub, with its wood floor and open fires still has everything you want from a traditional English pub. The bar is end to end real ale ( ordered into dark one end running through the ambers and ending in pales and ciders) The long time staff know there stuff and will be happy to help you find the perfect beer for you. The food menu is a treat for meat eaters. The meat sharing bord is BBQ heaven and the pies are locally famous. By far the best pub in the area!!!

Pub/ restaurant that's a cut above the rest.,"We live locally and have been many times both as a couple and with family (including the dog). This well presented and friendly pub has always impressed us. There selection of real ales and spirits are unsurpassed in the area and are served by staff that are both knowledgeable and helpful. We normally eat and drink in the bar area but there is a beautiful dining room upstairs that always seem busy. The food is always amazing and varied but sometimes I feel the presentation is over complicated ( trust me I know my stuff). Portions are good and table service is consistently good. Dogs are allowed in the bar but I have never seen any children here and get the impression that it is not a family pub but a place were adults can go for a superior drink and dining experience in a nice ,light pub environment. All in all this place is great. A little pricier than others but you get what you pay for.",Date of visit: March 2016,The Mute Swan,1,"East Molesey, United Kingdom"
Good fun,"Took the family for a birthday treat (4 adults, 5 kids). Ice cream menu is big and it arrived looking and tasting great . The staff are a little quite for what bills itself as a fun ice cream parlor but I kind of forgive them when you see what they have to put up with. Because of its fun family feel its often packed with large groups of very loud, very messy kids! The noise was terrible and I couldn't wait to get out. This is not there fault and I don't want you to think the place isn't good but if you can't stand the sound of children screaming and running around don't go in half term, weekends or in the summer. If you want a fun adult ice cream fest go in the evenings or weekdays.",Date of visit: March 2016,Creams,1,"Kingston upon Thames, United Kingdom"
Best hotel I've stayed in in the US (and that's a lot),"I stayed here for 4 nights and I really didn't want to leave. Its small but homely and always clean. Nice communal area and when were were there that did a getting to know u night with free drinks and nibbles. The staff are so so lovely and always there to chat or advise. Dorms are not cramped like so many hostels I've stayed at and were well equipped with lockers, nice bedding and storage bags attached to each bed to hold small things like water bottles and phones. Its little details like this that make it so great. The area is busy and fall of bars and restaurant. I will always have very fond memories of my time at the Apple.

Lovely cafe,"I've been here several times, both eat in and take away and I am always impressed. The food is amazing, well thought out and interesting ( try the sausage roll with apricot!) Staff are polite and upbeat and always ready to help. The cafe is a little small but that can't be helped. This is my go to stop when I need a really nice snack in Teddington.",Date of visit: March 2016,The French Tarte,1,"Teddington, United Kingdom"
Good value.,Considering most places in country parks and stately homes charge and arm and a leg for tea and cakes I was pleasantly surprised at The Peasantry. The food is good quality and well presented. There are a mixture of things on offer for a quick snack but not so much on offer for hot food. Its always clean and although it's not the most stimulating of environments its a nice place to stop off for a brake when your out for a long walk in the park.,Date of visit: February 2016,The Pheasantry Cafe,1,"Teddington, United Kingdom"
Old world charm,"Lovely little country pub that's packed to the rafters with old world charm. There are lots of nooks and crannys to sit it while you pick what you want from the well balanced menu. They do good ,honest English home cooking as well as a few nice Asian dishes and there are always seasonal specials on offer. The beers/ drink selection is good but small in comparison to big chain pubs but I rather like that. Always a nice place to come when I'm in this part of the world.",Date of visit: February 2016,Glasshouse Inn Pub & Restaurant,1,"Longhope, United Kingdom"
If i could give zero stars i would. Stay away!!!!!,"Possibly the most miserable stay I have ever had.

Stay away from this place at all cost.

I booked here over the Christmas period which covered nearly 2 weeks. In that time I was forced to moved rooms 3 times!! The first was actually on Xmas eve and out visiting friends when I was contracted by my mobile at 11:30pm to tell me what was happening, the second was grudgingly prearranged and last time I come back to find all my things had been packed and put in another room. WITH NO NOTICE, EXPLANATION OR APOLOGY!!!!! I felt unsafe and that my privacy had been invaded. At this point I still had over a week to stay but I was so miserable I asked for the rest of my money back as I didn't want to stay any more. They refused saying they had a strict no refund policy. I finally got half my money and left. All the rooms were cramped and bare. No,life, soul or atmosphere. The reception was never manned. You had to use a phone there to call for assistance and then they would take 15mins to arrive at the property. Completely unsafe and unhelpful.
They are just out for the money. The staff were uncaring and rude. JUST DON'T GO THERE",Date of stay: December 2015,All Days Hostel,1,"Toronto, Canada"
