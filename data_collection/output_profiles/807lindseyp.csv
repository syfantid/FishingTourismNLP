Visited for lunch today.,"Visited for lunch today. This is a little gem! Fresh seafood, beautifully presented and delightful staff.",Date of visit: August 2020,The Little Seafood Bar,4,"Hatfield Heath, United Kingdom"
Off the beaten track but don’t miss it!,"Happened across this restaurant whilst walking off the beaten track! Took one look and decided to book for lunch the following day and we were not disappointed! On our return we were made to feel very welcome. The food was delightful - we shared the prawn, potato and salmon starter, followed by my choice of seafood rice and mum had the chicken. Dessert was a difficult choice, but the rice pudding made with coconut milk and the gluten free carrot cake were a triumph! A very good Albariño to accompany at €3 a glass. This is a gem!",Date of visit: December 2019,El Reloj de Harry & Sally,4,"Madrid, Spain"
Wonderful food!,"Had lunch here with my husband on a Sunday! Lovely setting, very friendly staff. Above all excellent food (portobello mushroom starter was the star for me). My husband has travelled extensively in India and he felt this was the best Indian food he had had outside of the country. Will definitely be returning.",Date of visit: October 2019,Namaaste Kitchen,4,"London, United Kingdom"
A real gem!,"This is the best B&B we have ever stayed in. From a warm, friendly welcome including freshly baked scones to the excellent breakfast, the stay was faultless. The owners are clearly passionate about making your stay with them a memorable one. Spotless bathroom with large, soft towels and luxury toiletries and a bright room equipped with Nespresso coffee machine, bottled water and crisp bedlinen. We give it ️️️️️",Date of stay: May 2019,Green Dragon House,4,"Axminster, United Kingdom"
"Great setting, lovely seafood","Relaxed atmosphere (no need to dress up) with an beautiful view. The staff were friendly and service was well pitched. Excellent wine choices. Food was beautifully presented and using the freshest of produce.
One piece of advice - if you are wanting a taxi make sure you prebook your return as this can prove problematic",Date of visit: May 2019,Hix Oyster & Fish House,4,"Lyme Regis, United Kingdom"
Underwhelmed,"We had high expectations but were left feeling rather disappointed. Our first impressions were good. The interior is very nice and initial staff welcome was friendly. We ordered a starter to share (merguez sausages with beets and carrots) which was excellent. I had the tagine with pearl barley. This was pleasant but I had expected the flatbread to be warm not cold. My husband ordered the lamb but said it lacked flavour. However our biggest complaint would be the service. This was particularly evident when it took 30 minutes for our table to be cleared and to be asked if we wanted dessert/coffee. Staff had attended the tables next to ours on at least five occasions but did not seem to notice that we had finished eating.

On raising this with the staff they did reduce our bill, which was fair and much appreciated.",Date of visit: May 2019,River Cottage Kitchen,4,"Axminster, United Kingdom"
Perfect!,We recently used Williams’ Restaurant at Tewinbury for a family meal. From start to finish the staff were helpful and understanding of our circumstances (my father had recently passed away). On the day the food was excellent and the service was faultless. We could not have asked for more.,Date of visit: May 2019,Williams' Bar and Restaurant,4,"Welwyn Garden City, United Kingdom"
Wonderful trip with lovely family!,"We have just returned from our day on the boat. A truly wonderful trip, enjoying the hospitality of Antonia and her family. Captain Hassan was also a star! The food they produced from the catch of the day was amazing! Great day, great experience. Would recommend to all visitors to the island.",Date of experience: May 2018,Fishing Tourism Kefalonia Michalis,4,"Cephalonia, Greece"
Better than walked no along the roadside,Enjoyed a lovely walk along Tiber today. Calm and away from the pollution of the Monday traffic. Images are amazing.,Date of experience: May 2017,Piazza Tevere,4,"Rome, Italy"
In serious need of refurbishment,"This hotel has so much to do to bring it up to modern standards. Whilst its position is perfect, its rooms are not.

Damp patches evident all over the outside wall of my 4th floor room. This was backed up by the noise of dripping onto the windowsill all night. I had to put the bath mat out of the window to deaden the noise. Clearly the guttering needs attention.

Whist the room was clean and the bed comfortable, the bathroom was poor. Black mould marks on the floor and the tiling in the shower cubicle was crude to say the least. The side panel of the shower plinth was missing exposing a sharp corner. The temperature control kept coming off meaning it was not possible to know how hot the water was.

I recently stayed at the Regency Hotel nearby and whilst they didn't offer breakfast I would suggest this is a better option!",Date of stay: September 2016,The Brighton Hotel,4,"Brighton, United Kingdom"
Beautiful wedding!,"I have just returned from attending a friend's wedding at Royal Marmin Bay. This hotel is very special in many ways.

Firstly the elevated position gives it a truly amazing view. The combination of water and mountains is spectacular!

The hotel staff are among the most hard working and friendly I have ever encountered. Rooms were immaculate, public areas too! We stayed B&B as we prefer to experience the local restaurants (they too did not disappoint - those in Plaka were our favourites). The breakfast was ample and of good quality.

I am loathe to recommend too highly as I don't want this little gem to be overrun!!! However we will be back!",Date of stay: May 2016,Royal Marmin Bay Boutique & Art Hotel,4,"Crete, Greece"
Octopus salad is a must!,Enjoyed lunch here after a boat trip to Spinalonga. We chose to have two dishes along with the obligatory Greek salad! The octopus salad was the best dish of the week!,Date of visit: May 2016,Olondi Restaurant,4,"Crete, Greece"
Great find!,V quiet on arrival but meant we were attended to quickly. Staff very friendly particularly the manager. Food was of a high standard and very fairly priced. The complimentary limoncello was a nice touch! Will definitely be back!,Date of visit: September 2015,El Paso,4,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"
Small plate dining at its best !,"Visited on Friday lunchtime. No wait to sit at bar, which is where we like to sit and watch chefs at work! We were spilt for choice and settled on four dishes, plus a dessert. Staff were very friendly and attentive. We had Spanish wine by the glass, which was very good and at £4/5 per glass, excellent value. We are big fans of small plate dining, and the food came at a good pace. Quality ingredients and beautifully presented. Potted crab was my favourite.

Definitely will return when next in the area!",Date of visit: September 2015,The Coach,4,"Marlow, United Kingdom"
Lovely food and staff,"Visited on Friday evening. Had a drink at the bar whilst reviewing the menu. I was hoping for a more Spanish style menu, whereas it was more Greek influenced. That said, the food was very good, and we had a very good bottle of Spanish white. Will be back!",Date of visit: August 2015,Bar Azita Hitchin,4,"Hitchin, United Kingdom"
